3P30DK079337-12S1,Revision application for Chronic Disease and Health Disparities to the UAB-UCSD O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research,"The overarching goal of this competitive revision application is to extend the mission of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)-University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Oâ€™Brien Center for Acute Kidney
Injury (AKI) Research by defining the impact of AKI on the excess burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
in the Southeastern US. The clustering of major CKD risk factors such as black race, obesity and diabetes
in our region is a key driver of the high prevalence of CKD in the Southeastern US. As such, identifying
potential interventions to reduce the incidence and progression of CKD in these vulnerable populations is
critical for reducing the substantial social and financial costs associated with CKD and related health
disparities (stroke, heart disease, death) in our region. AKI affects as many as 20% of hospitalized patients
and is a recognized risk factor for the development of CKD, cardiovascular disease and death. These
outcomes may be modifiable by care provided in the post-AKI period, yet optimum care for care of AKI
survivors is not well defined and is often fragmented after discharge. Disadvantaged patients are at
especially high risk for inappropriate follow-up and low quality of care, suggesting that disparities in AKI
outcomes contribute to the excess risk of incident and progressive CKD in high-risk populations in our
region. However, progress in this area is hampered by a lack of data on the degree to which differences in
AKI outcomes contribute to CKD disparities in the Southeastern US, and potential interventions that may
target these disparities. Accordingly, the primary focus of this application is to define the impact of AKI
during acute hospitalization on incident and progressive CKD; how these associations differ by race, obesity
and diabetes status; and pilot a dedicated AKI follow-up clinic as a potential intervention to address
disparities in these outcomes. Specifically, Aim 1 will leverage an established, ongoing regional CTSA
collaborationâ€”the Southeastern Shared Health Research Information Network (SE-SHRINE)â€”to examine
all hospitalized AKI patients within four centers (UAB, MUSC, UAMS, U Kentucky) and link them to the US
Renal Data Systems to define disparities in AKI outcomes ([i] severity and duration of AKI; [ii] recovery of
dialysis-dependent AKI or development of ESRD after discharge; and [iii] associated health disparities such
as death and cardiovascular disease) by race, obesity and diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility and
collect key efficacy measures of a dedicated AKI follow-up clinic for patients with AKI discharged to the
community at three Southeastern CTSA hubs (UAB, Vanderbilt, U Kentucky). We will leverage the
resources available in Oâ€™Brien Cores to integrate existing intellectual and technological resources of UAB
and facilitate the success of this project. This project will help build a collaborative research network for AKI
research that could serve as a platform for multi-center, transdisciplinary science and clinical trials focused
on reducing the burden of CKD and related health disparities in the Southeastern US.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5I01BX004047-02,Lymphangiogenesis in the pathogenesis of Acute Kidney Injury,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that
has significant attributable morbidity and mortality in critically ill Veterans. Analysis of Veterans Health
Administrative data reported that Veterans who develop AKI during a hospitalization are at substantial risk for
the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) within 1 year. Numerous therapeutic interventions have
been evaluated in clinical trials to overcome this significant clinical challenge, with none proven successful.
The overall goal of this proposal is to fill this gap in knowledge by discovering new targets that could be
exploited for therapeutic interventions in AKI.
 The lymphatic system is crucial for maintaining fluid balance, transporting lipids, and aiding in immune
function. During pathological conditions that involve inflammation such as would occur in AKI and the AKI to
CKD transition, these functions of the lymphatic system are further accentuated. Inflammation induces
lymphangiogenesis through expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), particularly VEGF-C,
VEGF-D, and their receptor VEGF-R3. New lymphatic vessels can then aid in transition of inflammatory cells,
removing the cellular debris from the microenvironment of inflammation-induced injury, draining the excess
fluid and ultimately facilitating tissue repair. While recent studies have shown lymphangiogenesis to be an
active participant in a number of inflammatory diseases, very little is known about the role of the lymphatic
system and more importantly, lymphangiogenesis, in the pathogenesis of AKI and the AKI to CKD transition.
Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant upregulation of lymphangiogenic markers along with increased
lymphatic vessel density during AKI.
Our central hypothesis is that inflammation associated lymphangiogenesis (IAL), regulated by
VEGF-C expression in myeloid and proximal tubule cells, is involved in the resolution of inflammation following
AKI and the AKI to CKD transition.
The aims of this proposal are designed to 1) determine how
lymphangiogenesis modulates AKI; 2) determine how lymphangiogenesis affects the AKI to CKD transition;
and 3) determine the cross-talk between the proximal tubule and myeloid cells in regulating
lymphangiogenesis, inflammation, and AKI. Successful completion of the aims of this project will help
elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AKI during both injury and the recovery
phases and have the potential to provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions in AKI.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in hospitalized Veterans.

2T32DK007545-31,Interdisciplinary Training in Kidney-Related Research,"ABSTRACT:
 The primary goal of this ongoing interdisciplinary training program, currently in the 30th year, is to bring
together pre-clinical scientists and translational investigative researchers to catalyze the transformation of
postdoctoral fellows from both basic science and clinical disciplines into independent academic faculty
committed to kidney-relevant research. The training program builds on new initiatives in renal
pathophysiology, cell and molecular biology, vascular biology, basic immunology, genetics, transplantation,
acute and chronic kidney disease and in clinical and translational research. The UAB Clinical and
Translational Science Award, the Office of Postdoctoral Education, and the Physician Scientist Development
Office provide essential facilities that embrace trainee education as well as mentor training, also a major goal
of this program. The Program accepts PhD and MD scientists from a large applicant pool that includes
physicians in the ABIM Research pathway, which recruits highly meritorious candidates to pursue a career in
academic medicine.
 Thirty (54%) of our 55 trainees are in academia, 11% are still pursuing post-graduate training and 9% have
pursued non-academic positions, although still in science-based careers. Trainees have been successful in
obtaining 25 highly competitive extramural grants, including 17 career development awards. During the past
10 years, all positions have been filled and the 24 trainees have published 67 peer-reviewed publications.
During this funding cycle, the training program included 5 outstanding clinical and 2 underrepresented minority
trainees. Four of our trainees have obtained K awards, one has an AHA National Scientist Development
Award and two have pending K awards. These trainees have transitioned to faculty positions and pursuing
kidney-related research.
 The program has benefitted from a multidisciplinary collaborative faculty from 10 Departments and robust
institutional infrastructure and support. The strong commitment of the 45 preceptors, organized in four
thematic areas - renal physiology and pathophysiology, epithelial biology, vascular biology related to kidney
disease and clinical and translational research â€“ who are actively involved in the training of young scientists in
the use of basic and applied approaches are also strengths of this training grant. The collaborative
environment of our institution, embodied in the University-Wide Interdisciplinary Research Centers Program,
the Nephrology Research and Training Center, and the NIDDK-funded O'Brien Center, provides an ideal
setting for the implementation of interdisciplinary kidney-related research and training. Based on the
accomplishments during this cycle, continued support of four postdoctoral trainees is being requested in this
competing renewal application.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

5U54ES030246-02,Project 3: Intercepting Renal Damage following Skin Exposure to Arsenicals,"Arsenicals are an important category of chemical weapons due to their devastating effects on the skin as well
as systemic effects damaging multiple organs including the kidney and lung. This project is based on our
findings that cutaneous exposure to lewisite, an arsenical first synthesized during world war I, not only
damages skin but is also rapidly absorbed and exerts toxic effects in the kidney leading to both acute and
delayed kidney damage. Preliminary studies demonstrate that arsenicals cause epigenetic histone remodeling
by hyperacetylation and recruitment of BRD4 to promoter regions of inducible genes associated with
inflammation and tissue damage. BRD4 is a member of the bromo- and extra-terminal domain family of
proteins. In addition, we observed marked upregulation of the cytoprotective protein, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-
1) in the kidney following topical exposure to lewisite. Arsenicals induce higher expression of BRD4 and
inflammatory signaling genes in HO-1 knockout mice as compared to wild-type littermates, suggesting the
importance of HO-1 in epigenetic regulation of inflammatory responses. Taken together, these studies
underscore the significance of both acute and delayed kidney damage following a single cutaneous arsenical
exposure and identify two potential inter-related molecular targets, BRD4 and HO-1 in renal injury.
 The overall goal of this project is to develop mechanism-based post-exposure countermeasures that
can mitigate arsenical-induced kidney damage. Our hypothesis is that toxic doses of arsenicals cause
acetylation of proteins (histones) and subsequent recruitment of bromodomain proteins resulting in activation
of injury pathways and that blocking bromodomain signaling or its downstream effectors can mitigate kidney
injury. In Aim 1, an arsenical mediated murine model of AKI will be characterized to determine the dose- and
time-dependence of kidney damage. In Aim 2, we determine the mechanisms by which arsenicals cause AKI
focusing on BRD4 and HO-1 for intervention in arsenicals-induced AKI. In Aim 3, we will develop targeted
therapeutic intervention in arsenical-induced AKI to determine the optimal window for the beneficial effects by
post-exposure treatment in animals exposed to arsenicals. Both FDA approved and novel small molecules will
be assessed in this aim. Successful completion of our research as proposed here will not only provide an
effective antidote for chemical injury but will also contribute to a broader understanding of how endogenous
epigenetic responses can be exploited towards developing new therapeutic strategies for AKI.",,2019,564771,452559,112212,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Genetics; Kidney Disease,ANUPAM  AGARWAL

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that has significant attributable morbidity and mortality. Multiple epidemiological studies suggest a relationship of acute kidney injury with the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease. The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the biologic basis for the cytoprotective effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and generate relevant and feasible therapeutic strategies based on induction of HO-1 expression in acute kidney injury. During the previous project period we focused on the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of HO-1 and the molecular regulation of HO-1 gene expression in acute kidney injury. Our studies have (i) identified a novel enhancer sequence that regulates human HO-1 gene expression, (ii) generated a number of conditional cell/tissue specific HO-1 mouse strains, (iii) the discovery that HO-1 can regulate autophagy in acute kidney injury, and (iv) HO-1 regulates the trafficking of myeloid derived immune cells, and lack of myeloid HO-1 impairs recovery from acute kidney injury and results in increased fibrosis. Using the knowledgebase generated during the last funding cycle, we will address the central hypothesis that HO-1 expression regulates cross-talk between the renal proximal tubules and myeloid cells, and HO-1 upregulation either in tubules or myeloid cells will not only protect against acute kidney injury, but also the subsequent evolution of chronic kidney disease. We will execute the following specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that proximal tubule HO-1 expression affects differentiation, infiltration, and trafficking of myeloid cells in acute kidney injury; Aim2: To test the hypothesis that myeloid cell HO-1 expression modulates inflammation in acute kidney injury and the transition to chronic kidney disease; and Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that HO-1 induction using small molecules will provide protection against acute kidney injury and the transition to chronic kidney disease. Successful completion of the studies in this renewal application will (i) provide key information on the protective mechanisms in acute kidney injury, (ii) highlight the role for HO-1 in orchestrating the cross-talk between the renal tubules and myeloid cells, and (iii) provide novel candidate agents to be potentially utilized in the preventio and treatment of acute kidney injury, thereby paving the way for a new therapeutic approach in this disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly in critically ill patients.

5F31MH114316-04,Altered Dopamine Transporter Function in Autism,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dopamine (DA) plays key roles in the central nervous system by regulating a variety of physiological states,
including cognition, motivation, and attention. While DA dysfunction is known to be involved in several
neuropsychiatric disorders, its role in the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as
comorbidities associated with ASD (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) are largely unknown.
The DA transporter (DAT) is a key constituent of DA signaling in the CNS and the principal regulator of DA
homeostasis, mediating the active re-uptake of DA from the synapse following its release upon action potential
depolarization. The research proposed focuses on understanding how rare variants (RVs) in the human DAT
(hDAT) gene (SLC6A3) identified in several ASD subjects cause aberrant hDAT function and disrupted DA-
associated behaviors. Importantly, this work will determine how RVs in hDAT support DA dysfunction, a
complication associated with ASD.
Our laboratory recently defined the first ASD identified de novo mutation in hDAT. This mutation located in the
seventh transmembrane domain, a region critical to DA uptake and efflux, dramatically alters hDAT function
both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this de novo DAT mutation alters DA neurotransmission and DA-associated
behaviors as observed in Drosophila melanogaster. The work presented in this proposal aims to create a novel
set of discoveries exploiting the structural, functional and behavioral findings from the analysis of new hDAT
variants identified in multiple individuals with ASD.
We will (S.A. #1) engineer the hDAT ASD variants to determine their putative structural and functional deficits
in heterologous expression systems. We will generate transgenic Drosophila lines expressing hDAT wildtype
or hDAT variants specifically in DAergic neurons to determine the functional impairments of these hDAT
variants in whole, intact Drosophila brains. We will use (S.A. #2) these transgenic Drosophila lines to evaluate
the behavioral significance of hDAT dysfunction supported by these hDAT variants.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Dopamine plays key roles in motivation, reward, and cognition as well as in the pathophysiology associated
with various neuropsychiatric disorders. Multiple rare, functional gene variants possibly resulting in dysfunction
of dopamine neurotransmission have been identified in autism spectrum disorder. The three-year project

5U54ES030246-02,Project 2: Attenuating Pulmonary Toxicity of Cutaneous Exposure to Arsenicals,"Cutaneous exposure to highly reactive and toxic arsenicals such as lewisite, diphenyl chloroarsine, diethyl
chloroarsine and diphenyl cyanoarsine may occur accidently or by deliberate release. Acute cutaneous
exposures cause severe local blistering and inflammation in distal organs, such as the lung, causing injury and
respiratory failure. The pathogenesis of arsenical-induced lung injury is incompletely understood and a search
for effective treatment regimens has been a challenge. Using RNA-Seq of lungs obtained from cutaneous
exposed arsenical we identified several bromodomain 4 (BRD4) target genes that were altered. BRD4 is a
member of the bromo- and extra-terminal (BET) domain family of proteins that on binding to acetylated histones
initiates the inflammatory cascade. This proposal focuses on understanding the role of BET proteins and
associated inflammatory pathways in cutaneous arsenical-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and delayed lung injury
(DLI). Our preliminary data indicates increased BRD4 protein and histone acetylation in lung following cutaneous
arsenical exposures. We also demonstrate that JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, mitigates lung injury and decreases
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, following cutaneous exposure to phenyl arsineoxide (PAO; a surrogate
arsenical). Therefore, we hypothesize that toxic doses of arsenicals cause acetylation of proteins and
subsequent binding to BET proteins, resulting in activation of injury pathways, and that blocking BET signaling
or its downstream effectors can mitigate arsenicals-induced lung injury. The proposed studies are divided into
three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize arsenical-induced lung injury in mice following cutaneous exposures
to arsenicals. These exposures will be carried out at MRIGlobal, a contract organization specializing in carrying
out such exposures. For mechanistic studies and testing of therapies, aim 1 will also develop an in-house PAO
model of cutaneous arsenical-induced ALI and an inhalation model of arsenic trioxide (ATO). Studies in Aim 2
will determine mechanisms by which arsenicals cause acute pulmonary toxicity. These in vitro and in vivo studies
will be carried out using both warfare-related arsenicals and surrogates of arsenicals in primary lung cells and
mice and will identify downstream therapeutic targets and molecules that can mitigate the toxicity induced by
these chemicals. These studies will utilize the Drug Development Core in acquiring novel synthetic or FDA-
approved molecules to test for therapeutic efficacy. Studies in Aim 3 will determine whether small molecule
inhibitors of bromodomain signaling can mitigate arsenical-induced lung injury and associated morbidity. These
in vivo mouse studies will initially be carried out using ATO or PAO. Successful candidate molecules, obtained
through our Drug Development Core, will then be tested with more potent arsenicals. Results of the proposed
research will help identify treatment options for cutaneous arsenical exposure-induced lung injury as well as for
other potentially toxic chemicals associated with blistering and inflammation.",,2019,705975,565708,140267,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Biodefense; Lung; Rare Diseases,Aftab  Ahmad
5U01ES025069-06,Extracellular RNA as therapeutic target after toxic chemical inhalation,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to toxic inhaled chemicals like sulfur mustard (SM) can cause injuries to the respiratory system, eyes, skin and also frequently leads to death. The pathogenesis of sulfur mustard-induced injury is incompletely understood and a search for effective treatment regimens has been a challenge. SM-induced toxicities activate several pathways that include the coagulation and inflammatory pathways. Extracellular RNA (exRNA) and hypoxic signaling events drive several factors implicated in these pathways. This proposal focuses on understanding the role of extracellular RNA and associated inflammatory pathways in SM-induced injuries. These studies will be carried out using CEES, a surrogate of sulfur mustard as well as sulfur mustard. We hypothesize that CEES/SM exposures release exRNA that causes activation of the coagulation pathway and also inhibition of HIFs that in turn activate proinflammatory pathways. And that blocking of exRNA and stabilization of HIFs can alleviate toxicity and lung injury. The proposed studies are divided into three aims. Aim 1 will test whether blockage of exRNA using RNase or synthetic cationic polymers can mitigate CEES/SM-induced injury. The second aim will test whether activation of the hypoxia- inducible transcription factor will decrease inflammation and mitigate CEES-induced injury. Aim 3 will determine mechanisms by which CEES causes injury. This aim will also test whether therapeutic inhibition of exRNA from other chemical inhalations like chlorine can reduce injury. Since previous studies from our group and others have indicated a beneficial effect with combination therapies this aim will also test whether combining the two therapies tested in Aims 1 and 2 above can provide a better protection. Results of the proposed research will help identify treatment options for sulfur mustard exposures as well as other potentially toxic chemical inhalations associated with increased exRNA and metabolic poisoning.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this U01 is to develop specific medical countermeasures that can be used to rescue victims of civilian disaster, acts of terrorism, and military attack after exposures to toxic inhaled gases.

5U01ES028182-03,Targeting cardiopulmonary calpains to mitigate toxicity of halogen gases.,"Accidental leaks from manufacturing plants are common and large groups of people may be exposed to high
halogen (Cl2/Br2) concentrations. Use of halogen gases as chemical weapons is also on the rise. Victims of
accidental bromine exposure experience respiratory distress, cardiac arrest and circulatory collapse. Studies
evaluating acute and chronic sequelae of Br2 exposure are scant and treatment remains symptomatic as no
effective countermeasures exist. Our studies have established that the heart is severely injured in animals that
survive high dose halogen (Cl2/Br2) inhalation. The purpose of this application is to identify the biological
mechanisms responsible for these events and develop appropriate countermeasures. Based on exciting
preliminary data we propose that brominated reactants such as brominated lipids are produced in the lungs.
Brominated reactants/lipids reach the heart along with oxygenated blood. These reactants inactivate important
calcium pumps that regulate the heartbeats. Inactivity of calcium pumps causes calcium accumulation or
â€œcalcium overloadâ€ in the heart cells. Calcium overload is a serious problem and can lead to sudden cardiac
death. Increased calcium also activates destructive proteins, the calpains that destroy cardiac ultrastructure. We
therefore hypothesize that Br2 inhalation produces highly reactive intermediates that activate Ca2+ sensitive
calpains leading to cytoskeletal and mitochondrial damage and myocardial dysfunction and that calpain inhibition
will mitigate Br2-induced cardiopulmonary dysfunction and death. These hypotheses will be tested by completing
the experiments outlined in the following specific aims. SA#1: Characterize cardiac injury and death induced by
Br2 inhalation. SA#2: Test the hypothesis that Br2 and Br2 reactants activate cardiac calpains and cause
cytoskeletal and mitochondrial damage. SA#3: Test whether calpain inhibitor based countermeasures mitigate
acute and chronic effects caused by Br2 inhalation. The outcome from this project will identify an effective antidote
for bromine toxicity and enhance readiness for emergencies arising from accidental or intentional exposures.","The proposed research is relevant to public health because new treatment strategies for halogen inhalation-
induced toxicity are desperately needed. Halogen gases such as bromine are highly reactive, corrosive
`inhalational' threat agent that can spread both as liquid and as fumes. Inhalation of bromine causes extensive
injury to the lungs and the heart. Our goals are to identify the biochemical and molecular mechanisms
responsible for these injuries and develop effective countermeasures.",2019,394553,275000,119553,Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Lung,Shama  Ahmad; Louis J.

5R01CA190688-04,SON-mediated gene expression and leukemia,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Leukemia is the most common and devastating cancer affecting children and young adults with high mortality rate. Mutations and altered expression of numerous transcription factors, RNA splicing factors and epigenetic modifiers have been identified in leukemia patients, indicating that dysregulation of gene expression machinery is a hallmark of leukemia. SON is a poorly characterized nuclear protein highly expressed in blood cells, and the critical role of SON in RNA splicing of cell cycle- and pluripotency-related genes was recently identified. Besides its RNA-binding ability and the function as a splicing mediator, SON has also been shown to repress transcription of a few mammalian genes. However, the mechanisms of SON-mediated transcriptional regulation and the disease relevance of SON functions are largely unknown. Our preliminary data from SON ChIP-seq analyses revealed that SON interacts with multiple genomic locations to suppress transcription of target genes which include critical factors associated with hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance and leukemogenesis. Interestingly, SON knockdown results in increased tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), eliciting gene activation at SON-targeted promoters. We also found that the C-terminus of SON containing RNA-binding motifs is necessary to suppress promoter activity, and identified several candidates of SON-interacting non-coding RNAs. More interestingly, SON E, a short SON isoform lacking RNA-binding motifs, is highly expressed in leukemia. In addition, SON E exhibits a dominant negative effect on full-length SON function in transcriptional repression, while enhancing full-length SON-mediated RNA splicing. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the SON complex containing RNA components suppresses target gene activation through regulating histone modifications, and upregulation of SON E (a short isoform) causes alterations in SON target gene expression and enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, which facilitates leukemogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we propose following specific aims; (1) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of SON-mediated transcriptional repression. (2) To investigate the effect of SON E upregulation on gene expression, proliferation and self-renewal in hematopoietic stem cells. (3) To identify the role of SON E in leukemogenesis. Investigation of the function of SON and its short isoform in controlling gene expression and leukemogenesis will generate valuable mechanistic insights into a novel mode of fine-tuning of gene expression, and reveal new therapeutic targets for leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Functional alteration in gene expression machinery is a hallmark of leukemia.

5R01HD095897-02,A MIR-486/DOCK3 SIGNALING AXIS MODULATES DYSTROPHIN-DEFICIENT PATHOLOGY,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that affects 1:5000 live male births in the US each
year. DMD is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the DYSTROPHIN (DMD) gene that results in severe
muscle wasting, loss of ambulation by age 12, cardiac arrhythmia, and death in early adulthood due to respiratory
failure. While there are several novel strategies (such as exon-skipping compounds to create partially-functional
Dystrophin protein) in clinical trials, none of them deal with the secondary signaling pathways and subsequent
muscle pathogenesis that occurs in DMD. There is growing evidence that genetic modifiers of DMD have a
significant impact on the outcomes and severity of DMD-related pathologies in patients. These DMD genetic
modifiers have the potential to serve as novel therapeutic entry points for the treatment of diseases. Previously
my laboratory identified miR-486 as a muscle-enriched microRNA that is decreased in expression in DMD patient
skeletal muscle biopsies.
In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that miR-486 and its target (DOCK3) play a significant role in
the regulation of skeletal muscle. We have strong data that demonstrates that miR-486 expression levels
decrease and an mRNA target (DOCK3) increases corresponding with the degree of dystrophic pathology. In
Aim 1, we will characterize the functional role of miR-486 on skeletal and heart muscles via characterizing
muscle performance and cardiac remodeling in miR-486 knockout (KO) mice on normal and mdx5cv backgrounds.
Aim 2 focuses on identifying the consequences of manipulating miR-486 and Dock3 expression on key
downstream signaling pathways including PTEN/AKT and Rac1/RhoA using a novel Dock3 conditional muscle
knockout mouse. Additionally, we will identify novel miR-486 target genes using Ago2-sequencing (CLIP-seq)
strategy to identify in vivo skeletal muscle targets of miR-486. Lastly, Aim 3 focuses on using transient miR-486
overexpression strategies (Adeno-associated viral vectors and engineered exosomes) delivered intramuscularly
and systemically to improve dystrophic symptoms at key developmental time points in mdx5cv mice. Our
combinatorial use of DMD patient muscle cell lines, miR-486 KO and Dock3 conditional muscle KO mice,
and experience evaluating genetic and drug compounds in mouse models of human diseases will allow
us to rigorously evaluate the use of a microRNA (miR-486) overexpression as a novel therapy for the
treatment of DMD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The major focus of this proposal is the characterization and manipulation of a microRNA regulator (miR-486) of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and one of its target mRNAs (DOCK3). We will manipulate miR-486 and
Dock3 expression levels, characterize their muscle phenotypes, and characterize their effects on key
downstream signaling cascades including PTEN/AKT and Rac1/RhoA signaling. Finally, we will explore whether
miR-486 overexpression (via Adeno-associated viral vectors/AAV or engineered exosomes) can block the

Emerging associations between acute elevations of air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and
ozone (O3), and the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of multiple disease states are increasing
awareness in the scientific community of the need for integration of reliable, real-time satellite remote-
sensing data into decision support systems across multiple domains, including healthcare. The
proposed conference, New Applications in the Use of Satellite Data Monitoring of Air Quality for
Population Health, Exposure Risk Estimation, and Public Outreach, seeks to initiate the collaborative,
multidisciplinary effort needed to design strategies for use of the wide suite of satellite data products
describing the impact of air quality (AQ) changes upon human health. Although NASA satellite data and
tools are freely available, the transformative potential of using them in epidemiological health and
translational research has been limited due to end usersâ€™ lack of knowledge regarding access to and
potential utility of the observations. The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO)
instrument, set for launch in late 2019 or early 2020, will assess the spatiotemporal variation of air
pollution, clouds, and aerosols over North America at intervals not historically available (e.g., hourly or
better in daylight, 10 km2 at the center of the field of regard). The proposed conference anticipates
bringing together a group of 75-100 stakeholders in healthcare from the public and private sectors,
atmospheric scientists with expertise in TEMPO instrumentation, and commercial cloud-service
providers to present and review the wide suite of AQ data products that will flow from TEMPO. Use of
TEMPO data products will fill an existing gap in the need for highly granular AQ measurements needed
to enhance current models in health/AQ research. Presenters will describe the potential applications for
data products in selected healthcare use cases, and define strategies for rapid dissemination of
TEMPO products to end users who need enhanced knowledge on environmental exposures to improve
decision making. The anticipated date for the conference, which will be held on the campus of the
University of Alabama in Huntsville, is August 3, 2019. The conference will be broadcast live for remote
attendees, and include opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to attend, present
posters, and serve on the Organizing Committee, along with offering assistance at activities
(registration, room monitors, AV needs) on the day of the event.","New Applications in the Use of Satellite Data Monitoring of Air Quality for Population

Core C is Gene Delivery Scientific Core whose goal is to provide Program Investigators with complete in vitro
and in vivo gene delivery solutions to facilitate completion of their specific aims. To accomplish this goal, the
Core C will channel its activities into three principal areas: a) providing services; b) developing and acquiring
new technologies, and c) building synergy with Projects and other Cores.
Service component: The Core C will serve a resource for all genetic manipulation needs of Projects and
Cores of this Program. Specifically, the Core C will a) achieve economy of scale and quality assurance
through centralized generation of recombinant DNA, viral constructs, and genetically modified microorganisms
by highly trained personnel; b) provide technical expertise, consultation and training in PCR, RT-PCR, qPCR,
DNA sequencing, gene delivery to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, constitutive and regulated gene silencing;
c) execute gene targeting and CRISPR/Cas and TALEN-mediated gene editing in cultured cells for the needs
of PPG projects; d) provide PPG Projects with enabling technologies for the production of genetically modified
laboratory animals, such as Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) modification, generation CRISPR/Cas
constructs for genome editing and genotyping of genetically altered animals; e) provide PPG investigators with
recombinant protein expression and purification expertise; f) Core C will provide training, experience and
expertise in the field of mitochondrial biology, including generation of cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA and
assays of bioenergetic status using Seahorse XF-24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer.
Academic component: Throughout previous cycles of funding Gene Delivery Core responded to changing
needs of the Projects by either acquiring new technologies or developing its own. This is exemplified by a
spectrum of custom retro- and -lentiviral vectors developed by the Core C, development of a system for
doxycycline-regulated gene expression, development of a system for regulated gene knockdown, by the
development of the gene expression system with a two-tier regulation, etc. In the course of the proposed
competitive renewal, Core C will fully implement, validate, and make available to a broad scientific community
a system for endothelial segment-restricted gene expression. In addition, we plan to establish a system for
point mutations knocking-in in endothelial cells.
Synergy with Projects and Scientific Cores: The Core C is a convergence point for all Projects and Cores
regarding genetic manipulation of pro- and eukaryotic organisms. The Core C also builds synergy with other
Scientific Cores through, e.g. procurement of endothelial cell lines from Core B, modifying these cell lines for
the expression of fluorescent reporters/sensors for the needs of Core D, and supplying these modified cell
lines to Core D for the use and to Core B for distribution to scientific community.","CORE NARRATIVE

5R01OD010944-08,Mouse models for mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mtDNA,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   
Mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality, yet only supportive care is available to affected patients. This
lack of effective therapies can be partly attributed to the lack of faithful animal models for mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA. Two critical obstacles to the availability of mouse models of these diseases are 1) the lack of mouse mtDNA mutations homologous to those found in human disease, and 2) the lack of a method to efficiently generate such mutations. Therefore, the long-term goals of the proposed studies are 1) to overcome these obstacles in order to enable routine modeling of human diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, and 2) to provide mouse models of mitochondrial disease to the research community. In this application, we propose to leverage expertise developed at the University of South Alabama (mutagenesis of mouse mtDNA) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (transmitochondrial mouse models) towards generating models of human diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrially-encoded tRNA genes. Using the tools and techniques developed in the previous funding cycle and in preliminary studies, we will 1) generate an arrayed library of mouse clones carrying mutations in mtDNA, 2) use it to perform a targeted screening for mutations in tRNALeuUUR and in tRNALys, and 3) use these mutations as well as tRNA mutations isolated by us previously for the generation and characterization of transmitochondrial animals. It is anticipated that, if successful, the proposed studies will deliver a powerful impetus to mitochondrial research in general and to research on mitochondrial disease in particular by providing the mitochondrial research community with (1) mouse model(s) for mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in tRNA genes, (2) an arrayed library of mouse clones suitable for targeted screening for mtDNA mutations of interest as well as tools and protocols for generating and screening such libraries, and (3) cell line(s) carrying mouse homolog(s) of human pathogenic mtDNA mutations.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   
Mouse models of human disease are instrumental for the development and testing of new therapeutic modalities, yet faithful models are not available for diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA.

Eleven investigators representing ~20% of the Basic Medical Sciences Faculty of the University of South
Alabama College of Medicine are seeking support under the Shared Instrumentation Grant Program to
acquire an XFe24 extracellular flux analyzer. These investigators are supported by 16 NIH grants (~75% of
all NIH grants issued to Basic Medical Sciences faculty). Almost 50% of all currently funded NIH awards to
Basic Medical Sciences Faculty will directly benefit from requested XFe24, and are participating. The number
of participants on this revised application has increased by ~50% (7 to 11) compared to A0.
XFe24 provides an unrivaled combination of features, including high sample throughput, t h e ability to
conduct studies in both cultured cells and tissue samples, and simultaneous measurement of two key
parameters representative of cellular bioenergetics: respiration (oxygen consumption) and
extracellular acidification. Additional features include widely compatible software and an improved sensor
design that dramatically improves signal stability and reproducibility when measuring extracellular
acidification. The current application targets key research projects at the USA College of Medicine that critically
need the cutting-edge capabilities of the XFe24. These high-priority projects include ongoing studies in
the areas of Mitochondrial Disease, Mitochondrial DNA Damage and Repair, Vascular Physiology and
Pathology, Metabolism, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Immunology, Cancer Biology, Environmental Toxicology
and Cell Biology. Major users include Drs. Alexeyev, Sobol, Stevens, Honkanen, Lim, Gillespie, and
Audia/Alvarez, whose projects focus on mitochondrial disease, cancer biology/environmental toxicology,
vascular endothelial biology, metabolism, smooth muscle biology, mitochondrial DNA damage and repair and
host-pathogen interactions, respectively.
Acquisition of the XFe24 is justified by: 1) the age (9 years) of the available XF24 instrument, 2) increasing
risk of a catastrophic failure in combination with 3) the End of Guaranteed Support for this instrument by the
manufacturer, 4) incompatibility of the available instrument with commercial glycolytic flux assays, and 5)
increasing demand among faculty for the XFe24's capabilities. In summary, procurement of the XFe24
instrument is critical to sustaining ongoing NIH-funded studies at the USA College of Medicine, to
broadening their scope, and to fostering t h e development of new projects by junior investigators.
Research in the areas of Mitochondrial Disease, Mitochondrial DNA Damage and Repair, Vascular

5P30AG050886-05,Core E:  Comparative Data Analytics Core,"The Comparative Data Analytics Core (CDAC) will provide not only high-level customized statistical support
for basic science investigators studying aging and energetics in diverse model organisms at UAB, but also a
venue for development of de novo methods specially for such research, a nidus for training others at and
beyond UAB in such research, and a platform for the dissemination of such methods to the aging research
community at large. The core leadership comprises statistical scientists with a 20-year history of studying the
interface of aging, energetics and body composition. They bring not only their statistical expertise, but their
experience with and zeal for the science of comparative studies at the interface of aging and energetics.
 The need for specialized statistical expertise, training, and support in aging research is clear. Statistical
analyses of aging research data provide many challenges. Aging research involves longitudinal analyses and
modeling the dependency of multiple observations taken over time, and accommodating the missing data
which commonly occurs with longitudinal studies. With time-to-event (e.g., survival) outcomes, left, right, and
interval censoring add further complexities. Statistical approaches in comparative biology face challenges such
as phylogenetic dependence among model residuals, complicating inference.
 Non-statistician researchers benefit from the support and involvement of statistical scientists who are deeply
involved in the subject matter, who can tailor methods to the situation at hand, who work with the biologists
from the beginning as an engaged part of the research team, who can discuss the methods with the biologists
and explain the statistical procedures and who can develop new statistical methods for specific needs.
To that end, the UAB CDAC offers the following specific aims:
1. To provide statistical support for UAB investigators studying the comparative energetics of aging, including
 traditional, specialized, and bespoke methods.
2. To provide statistical support for non-UAB investigators studying the comparative energetics of aging,
 including traditional, specialized, and bespoke methods.
3. To conduct high-level statistical investigations of secondary data to answer questions about the
 comparative energetics of aging.
4. To develop and evaluate statistical methods needed in the field of the comparative energetics of aging.
5. To provide an organized series of educational offerings on statistical methods for the comparative

1R01MD013818-01,Barriers to arteriovenous fistula use in black hemodialysis patients,"Abstract
To successfully and efficiently dialyze, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients must have a
reliable conduit to access the vasculature (vascular access), either an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or
arteriovenous graft (AVG). Despite national consensus vascular access guidelines that strongly recommend
preferential placement of AVFs, 80% of ESRD patients initiate HD with a central vein catheter (CVC). Such
patientsâ€” the focus of our grantâ€”require timely vascular access planning and surgery once they have initiated
HD to ensure a permanent AVF access is placed. Disparities in AVF use between blacks and whites begin at
HD initiation and increase progressively following AVF creation, such that at 1 year it is 58.8 vs 67.8%,
respectively, which translates to 5,000 excess deaths among blacks annually. The proposed grant will
investigate patient, provider, and system factors contributing to racial disparities in AVF use. Three major
surgical processes of care determine AVF use in hemodialysis patients. First, an AVF needs to be created in
the patient who initiates HD with a CVC. Second, the new AVF has to mature adequately to be used for HD.
Third, once the AVF has matured, it needs to maintain long-term patency for dialysis, often requiring access
interventions such as angioplasty, thrombectomy, or surgical revision. Aim 1 will use qualitative research to
elucidate views on AVFs and barriers to AVF processes of care among black and white patients at various
stages of dialysis care. We will use semi-structured interviews of black and white dialysis patients and their
providers (surgeons, nephrologists, and dialysis nurses) to identify common themes regarding the decision-
making around initial AVF creation and subsequent interventions. Aim 2 will use quantitative research to
determine whether there are racial disparities in the key processes of care required to achieve and maintain
AVF use for dialysis among patients initiating HD with a CVC. We will retrospectively query the national
USRDS database of incident HD patients to determine whether one or more of the 3 key AVF surgical
processes of care differ between blacks and whites. In parallel, we will prospectively collect more granular data
on these processes of care in patients initiating HD at a large dialysis center. Aim 3 will determine the
relationship between system level factors and AVF processes of care. Aim 4 will administer validated surveys
to incident black and white hemodialysis patients scheduled for AVF surgery over a 4-year period at UAB, and
quantify potential patient barriers to and facilitators of AVF use. We will then determine which specific patient,
provider, and system factors are associated with differences in AVF processes of care (identified in Aim 2) by
prospectively collecting vascular outcomes data for this UAB population. Finally, we will use mediational
analysis to identify the most important modifiable patient, provider, and system factors related to AVF use
among black dialysis patients. These factors will be used to develop a future multi-level interventional trial to
evaluate whether addressing specific barriers can reduce racial disparities in AVF use.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
A fistula created by surgically connecting an artery to a vein is the preferred form of conduit to provide blood
flow to the dialysis machine for chronic hemodialysis. Despite national guidelines, black dialysis patients are
less likely than white ones to use a fistula. This proposal will examine patient, provider, and system factors
that may explain racial disparities in fistula use, and use the insights gained to plan a future interventional trial
to enhance fistula use in black hemodialysis patients.",2019,462828,377965,84863,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Kidney Disease,MICHAEL  ALLON
5P01HL066299-17,Cell Culture and Small Animal Core,"CORE SUMMARY
Core B is the Cell Culture and Small Animal Scientific Core whose goals are to provide Program Investigators
with complete cell culture and cell isolation services (Cell Culture component) and a variety of small animal and
microbiological services (Small Animal component) that facilitate the completion of their Specific Aims. To
accomplish these goals, Core B will be centering its activities into three principal areas:
Service component: Core B will facilitate the performance of each project by centralizing cell processing
including isolation, characterization, and distribution of pulmonary endothelial cells (PAECs), microvascular
endothelial cells (PMVECs), and pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVECs) from wild type and genetically
modified rats and mice, and by providing consultation and training in cell isolation and culture. Core B will
facilitate the performance of each project by centralizing animal care including maintenance of mouse and rat
colonies (breeding and colony expansion) of animals harboring genetic mutations, by maintaining bacterial
stocks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and by generating P. aeruginosa-induced lung injury in rats and mice.
Academic component: Throughout previous funding cycles, Core B has adapted to the ever-changing needs
of the Projects by generating new reagents (e.g. providing pulmonary endothelial cells from genetically
modified rats and mice) or platforms (e.g. providing an experimental rodent model of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa-induced pneumonia and sepsis). During the current cycle, the Core has developed a novel
experimental platform -Monolayer Stress Microscopy- to assess endothelial cell mechanics via visualization of
forces occurring among cells and their subjacent substrate. In addition, the Core has generated mouse and rat
decellularized lung bio-scaffolds that will serve as a platform for examining endothelial cell heterogeneity.
Synergy with Projects and Scientific Cores: In collaboration with Core D (BioImaging and BioTechnology
Implementation Core), pulmonary endothelial cells and isolated lung tissues will be provided for 3D, 4D, and
5D imaging analyses. Scientifically, the analysis of monolayer mechanical forces and the generation of lung
scaffolds will become fundamental for data- and hypothesis- generation by providing innovative platforms to all
Projects and Cores. In this capacity, scaffolds repopulated with genetically modified cells (provided from Core
C) will be imaged using the novel approaches developed by Core D and the newly-acquired information will be
disseminated in coordination with Core A (administrative Core).","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Understanding the existing heterogeneity in the pulmonary circulation allowed the identification of disease
mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic approaches to combat those illnesses. The Cell Culture
component of the Core centralizes isolation of the required endothelial cells, and provides the reagents
necessary for completion of the proposed experiments in all projects. The Small Animal component of the
Core centralizes the development of a lung injury model and provides training for the assessment of outcomes
measures necessary for completion of the proposed experiments in all projects.",2019,266708,173187,93521,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,Domestic Higher Education,366880002,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza,Diego F.

 This â€œPre-Vent Apneaâ€ application brings together established investigators at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB; Clinical Site) with expertise in neonatal clinical and translational research
and at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMASS; Analytical Core) with complementary
expertise in control of breathing and signal processing in physiological systems. The overall objective of the
local project is to use a prospective cohort of 200 preterm infants <29 weeks gestation at UAB to
prospectively define and validate ventilatory mechanisms associated with resilience against or risk for
development of impaired oxygenation at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (physiologic definition of BPD) and at
follow-up (corrected age of 3 months) using multiparametric physiologic monitoring and intensive data
collection (96 hours each) at three distinct time frames: 2 weeks postnatal age, 32 weeks post-menstrual
age (PMA), 36 weeks PMA, in addition to continuous heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry
waveform recording from enrollment soon after birth until discharge.
 We will address the objective by the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1- Development and validation of mathematical models of personalized ventilatory patterns
based on multiparametric vital signs monitoring and signal analysis methods to (a) predict hypoxemic and/or
bradycardic episodes in individual infants before they occur, (b) identify patterns of ventilatory abnormalities
associated with BPD with and without pulmonary hypertension, as well as with and without respiratory or
feeding support at 3 months corrected age.
Specific Aim 2 - Determine if late (at or beyond postnatal day 14) mild permissive hypercapnia is associated
with reduction in apnea, bradycardia, and hypoxemic episodes and with improved stability of oxygenation.
Specific Aim 3 â€“ Determine if servo-controlled oxygen environment is associated with reduction in
hypoxemic episodes and improved stability of oxygenation, as compared to oxygen administered by nasal
cannula.
 In addition, for the multicenter collaborative project, we will collaborate with other clinical research
centers and a Leadership and Data Coordinating Center (LDCC) on a multicenter protocol that will
investigate ventilatory control mechanisms in outcomes of instability of oxygenation and acute and chronic
morbidity.
 The ultimate goal of our participation in this project is to gain greater insight into the pathogenesis of
respiratory disorders in extremely preterm infants and discover targets for new prevention and treatment
strategies to improve outcomes for very vulnerable children at the beginning of life.","Project Narrative:
Preterm infants often have abnormal control of breathing, resulting in prolonged pauses
in breathing, drops in heart rate, or decreases in blood oxygen levels. In this study, we
will use intensive data collection from multiple monitoring methods to develop
mathematical models and understand how control of breathing is abnormal in preterm
infants, and how it is associated with poor outcomes at follow-up.",2019,563824,417908,145916,Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infant Mortality; Lung; Neonatal Respiratory Distress; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Rare Diseases",Namasivayam  Ambalavanan; Premananda Pai Indic
5R00DE023826-05,Hedgehog Pathway Activity and Targeting in KCOT,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT) patients are treated surgically with more conservative surgical approaches leading to higher rates of recurrence. Research to reduce recurrence of KCOT is very limited and only focused on surgical technique, primarily owing to the severe lack of cellular models for preclinical studies fr the identification and testing of therapeutic options. The aims of this project are designed to utilize novel cell models of KCOT to explore hedgehog (HH) pathway signaling, the role of HH receptor polymorphisms in KCOT, and the potential to use HH as a therapeutic target for KCOT and other craniofacial tumors. KCOT can be non-syndromic or syndromic in association with Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by a mutation in the inhibitory receptors of the HH pathway, Patched 1/2 (PTCH1/2). When the receptor in mutated, it is believed to be unable to inhibit Smo and cause ligand-independent HH signaling, cell proliferation, and tumorigenecity. The K99 phase proposes to (1) to determine if the PTCH1 receptor polymorphism Pro1315Leu, identified in 75% of our KCOTs, has a functional significance in HH pathway activity by accessing cell proliferation, HH transcriptional activity, and tumorigenic and invasive properties in cells expressing PTCH with and without the polymorphisms; and (2) examine the biological effects and therapeutic efficacy of HH inhibition on primary KCOT cell populations, using clinically relevant HH inhibitors (GDC-0449 and LDE225, both currently in clinical trials) as well as selectively targeting the Smo protein using siRNA knockdown. During this time the candidate will complete mentored training in molecular biology and courses in clinical translation research and professional development in preparation for the independent R00 phase where it is proposed to develop animal model of KCOT for testing in vivo efficacy of HH inhibitors, starting with xenograft models of KCOTs. Information gleaned from this work may be useful in understanding the role of PTCH1 in fundamental HH signaling in human neoplasias and used in the generation of future clinical trials focusing on preventing KCOT recurrence.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs) are locally aggressive tumors that invade the jaw bone requiring surgery and no therapies are available to prevent recurrence. An association exists between KCOTs and alterations in the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway and the aims of this project will be to explore HH function in novel KCOT cell models and examine clinically relevant drugs, which target HH signaling, in KCOTs.

3R01DA038635-05S1,Opioid Ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (Administrative Supplement on Parent Grant R01DA038635),"Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which affects 47 million people
worldwide. There are over five million AD patients over the age of 65 in the U.S., which is predicted to increase
to 16 million by 2050, with a concomitant increase in socioeconomic burden. There are currently no approved
disease-modifying therapies for AD and the few symptomatic treatment agents available have limited impact.
Attempts to prevent or eliminate beta-amyloid plaques have been made by targeting the beta-site amyloid
precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the gamma-secretase enzyme. However, these
strategies have not yet achieved clinical success. Recent research suggests that indirect modulation of the
function of these enzymes via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) may provide a novel strategy to reduce A-
beta peptide production with potentially less side effects. Among GPCRs that influence amyloidogenesis, the
delta opioid receptor (DOR) in particular has been shown to play an important role in the trafficking and function
of BACE1 and gamma-secretase and in the production of A-beta peptide. Activation of DOR increases BACE1
and gamma-secretase activity in vitro and in a mouse model of AD, and antagonism of DOR specifically blocks
the amyloidogenic pathway and efficaciously prevents AD progression in mice. These effects were demonstrated
using a known DOR antagonist, naltrindole. However, the potential of DOR antagonists as therapeutic agents
for AD is yet to be explored.
 The parent grant for the proposed supplement targets mixed function ligands possessing agonist activity
at the mu opioid receptor (MOR) and antagonist activity at DOR. The target libraries of compounds generated
through the parent grant were prepared using a series of DOR antagonists as intermediates. This provides us
with a unique opportunity to characterize their DOR antagonist profile and explore the activity of selected
compounds for their ability to modulate the function of the APP processing enzymes and inhibit A-beta pathology.
To this end, in this supplemental effort, we will pursue the following specific aims: analyze and select a set of
preferred ligands from our library of opioid ligands; resynthesize samples of the selected ligands; evaluate the
selected ligands in vitro for their ability to inhibit enzymatic activity and subcellular localization; further select a
small set of the most promising compounds and evaluate their ability to mitigate AD-like pathology using APP/PS
double-transgenic mice. These evaluations will include behavioral tests (spatial memory by Morris Water Maze;
Novel Object Recognition) as well as assessment of A-beta level, beta-amyloid deposits, and inflammation
(activated astrocytes and microglia) in the brain.
 The results from this supplemental effort will provide insight into the novel approach of indirect modulation
via opioid receptors to achieve reduction in A-beta pathology and identify lead compounds for further
development as candidate AD therapeutics.","Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is projected to significantly increase in prevalence in the coming decades, but
no disease-modifying therapies for AD exist. Antagonism of the delta opioid receptor (DOR) has been shown to
block AD pathology by reducing the activity of amyloid processing enzymes. In this supplemental application, a
cohort of DOR antagonists and DOR-antagonist/mu opioid receptor (MOR)-agonist ligands will be tested from
the parent grant library for their ability to reduce amyloid processing enzyme activity and rescue AD pathology
in an AD transgenic mouse model to explore the potential of this novel approach for the treatment of AD.",2019,527409,316416,210993,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Drug Abuse,SOUTHERN RESEARCH INSTITUTE,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Research Institutes,352052708,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Opioids,SUBRAMANIAM  ANANTHAN
5R01NS086953-06,Poly (ADP-ribose) Mediates Cell Death in Stroke by Inhibiting Glucose Metabolism,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will identify the role of a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR)-dependent pathological process in stroke that we believe is a central pathway to induce bioenergetic defects, oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability transition in stroke. Stroke remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in United States and worldwide and lacks effective therapeutic innervations. There is a critical need to identify the molecular pathways of cell death in stroke so that novel therapeutic targets can be identified.  Excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation is strongly implicated to induce cell death in stroke. Studies have shown that PAR is a death signaling molecule in PARP-1 activation and that binding of PAR to hexokinase (HK-1) may cause bioenergetic collapse. However, the role of this PAR/HK-1 interaction in stroke is not known. HK-1 is an essential enzyme in the brain to regulate cellular bioenergetics via glycolysis and mitochondrial function, and maintains redox homeostasis via pentose phosphate pathway. In addition, protection of mitochondria against permeability transition is an important function of HK-1 in the brain. Preliminary data in this application supports the view that in cortical neurons exposed to OGD (an in vitro ischemia / stroke model), PAR binds HK-1 and alters its functions. Collapse of the HK-1 dependent cell survival functions namely bioenergetic balance, redox homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane protection are well known to induce cell death in stroke. Therefore, it is conceivable that binding of PAR to HK-1 is a central pathological pathway to induce cell death in stroke and therefore, may be a credible target for therapeutic intervention in
stroke. To directly and rigorously identify the role of this novel pathway in stroke, we will use viral-mediated knockdown of endogenous HK-1 and replacement with PAR-binding mutant form of HK-1 (pbmHK-1) in combination with OGD in neuronal cultures and an MCAO model of stroke in adult mice. We propose the following 4 aims: Aim #1: Does PAR-dependent inhibition of HK-1 mediate bioenergetic defects in OGD-treated neurons? Aim #2: Are oxidative stress and redox imbalance in OGD-subjected neurons the consequence of PAR/HK-1 interaction? Aim # 3: Does PAR-binding to HK-1 lead to mitochondrial permeability transition after OGD in neurons? Aim # 4: What is the role of PAR-binding to HK-1 on cell death in stroke in vivo?  Each of the proposed aims are supported by a set of important preliminary data, which strongly support the hypothesis that PAR to HK-1 is a central pathological process to induce cell death in stroke. Combining viral-mediated expression of pbmHK-1 with Seahorse Flux analysis, metabolic tracer studies, live-cell imaging and biochemical analysis in experimental models of stroke represent a novel approach to understand PAR- dependent cell death signaling in stroke in greater depth. These studies are crucial to further reveal the role of this novel HK-1/PAR pathway in stroke and to determine whether this important pathological pathway is a credible target for therapeutic intervention in stroke.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In stroke Poly (ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR), formed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibits hexokinase-1 (HK-1), which is an essential enzyme to maintains cellular bioenergetics, oxidative balance and mitochondrial integrity in the brain. Here we propose that inhibition of HK-1 by PAR is an upstream pathological event that leads to bioenergetic collapse, redox failure, and mitochondrial permeability transition in stroke. This study will reveal novel strategies for pharmacological intervention in stroke.",2019,321563,218750,102813,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences; Stroke,Shaida A.

5R01ES029981-02,Environmental Cadmium and COPD,"The lung is a major portal for respirable environmental toxicants including heavy metals such as cadmium
(Cd), which is recognized to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is the third
largest cause of mortality in the US. Airway remodeling with loss of the lumen of small airways and airflow
obstruction precede airspace enlargement and emphysema. Airway remodeling is associated with a profusion
of airway fibroblasts and an increase in extracellular matrix proteins. Vimentin is an intracellular type 3 filament
that can trigger peribronchial fibrosis. The prevalence of COPD is twice as high in a zip code where a
Superfund site is located in Birmingham, Alabama when compared to a control zip code with similar
demographics and smoking prevalence. We postulate that chronic low dose cadmium (Cd) exposure induces
alterations in vimentin-mitochondrial dynamics that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant activation
of peribronchiolar fibroblasts leading to bronchiolar luminal narrowing and subsequent COPD. We will examine
this hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1) Determine whether exposure to Cd in a cohort of smokers
and never-smokers from a Birmingham community predicts susceptibility to airway remodeling and COPD. (2)
Determine the mechanisms by which Cd mediates alterations in vimentin-mitochondrial dynamics to regulate
fibroblast activation. (3) Determine whether low dose Cd, or pSer39Vim induced airway remodeling and
airspace enlargement in a mouse model of COPD is associated with fibroblast invasion, ECM deposition and
apoptosis resistance. These studies will directly address a significant gap in our understanding of how
cadmium contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD and the role of vimentin filaments in mitochondrial
homeostasis. Early biomarkers of COPD in exhaled breath condensate may help us recognize disease
susceptibility. Importantly, these studies may provide novel therapeutic strategies in patients with COPD.","NARRATIVE:
Environmental exposure to cadmium can cause airway remodeling and COPD, though
the mechanisms remain unclear. We have demonstrated that Cd induces fragmentation
and activation of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein in fibroblasts from patients with COPD

underlying cadmium induced COPD will allow us to develop targeted therapy for this
disease, that is the third largest and growing cause of mortality in the US.",2019,508131,347728,160403,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Lung; Prevention,Veena B.

1K23HL146887-01,"Race, Natriuretic Peptides and Physiological Perturbations","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The applicant, Pankaj Arora, MD is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiovascular
Disease at University of Alabama at Birmingham. The applicantâ€™s goal is to become an independent
investigator in clinical and translational research and advance the understanding of how disorders in the
natriuretic peptide (NP) system contribute to the development of hypertension, heart failure and cardiovascular
disease. The applicant has shown a prior interest in understanding the genetics, NP system biology and an
ability to conduct high-quality patient-oriented research. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development Award (K23) describes a five-year plan that will allow the applicant to achieve independence as
an investigator, under the primary mentorship of Thomas J. Wang MD, an internationally-recognized leader in
the field of NP physiology. The applicant wishes to obtain knowledge and expertise in 4 specific domains: (1)
patient-oriented physiologic studies, (2) the pathophysiologic basis of race-related differences in cardiovascular
disease susceptibility, (3) exercise physiology, and (4) patient-oriented pharmacologic studies.
African-Americans have increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease which contributes to racial disparities
in outcomes such as death and hospitalization. NPs are natriuretic and vasodilatory hormones produced by
the heart in response to increased wall stress in the atria and ventricles. In preliminary work for this proposal,
we found that African-American race is associated with NP deficiency. Little is known about the physiological
consequences of the lower resting NP levels found in African-Americans. The current proposal will seek to
determine if there exists racial differences in how the heart responds to physiological perturbations such as
exercise and beta blockers. The specific aims are (1) To compare the NP response to beta blockers in African-
American and white individuals (2) To compare the NP response to exercise in African-American and white
individuals. Understanding these differences in release of NPs may have biological and therapeutic
importance in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.
The Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development award (K23) will provide Dr. Arora with the
necessary time to fully engage in multifaceted, carefully designed patient-oriented research protocols while
serving as a means to receive additional formal didactics. During the course of the award period, the applicant
will pursue a Master of Science in Public Health in Clinical & Translational Science at UABâ€™s School of Public
Health to advance his skills in patient-oriented research (epidemiology, biostatistics, study design, grant-
writing, and leadership courses). UABâ€™s rich collaborative, interdisciplinary environment with national
recognition for community engagement will provide Dr. Arora with a platform to successfully conduct the
research proposed in the plan. The proposed studies will prepare the investigator to design and conduct
interventional studies (e.g. R01) in specific racial subgroups to personalize existing and novel therapeutics
around the NP system.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
African-Americans have a higher prevalence of hypertension and heart failure but lower resting natriuretic
peptide levels than white individuals. We propose to study the racial differences in the natriuretic peptide

treatment approaches and reduce racial disparities in cardiovascular disease.",2019,193752,179400,14352,Other Research-Related,K23,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Physical Activity; Prevention,Pankaj  Arora
4R00AG056597-03,Abnormal Late Endosomal Trafficking in Frontotemporal Dementia due to Progranulin Mutation,"Project Summary/Abstract.
Candidate: My goal is to become an independent scientist investigating endolysosomal dysfunction in
neurodegenerative disease, with a focus on endosomal maturation and trafficking. My background is in
neuropharmacology and mechanisms of rodent behavior, but I have recently shifted to investigating abnormal
endosomal trafficking in progranulin-insufficient mice. Having received my PhD in 2012, this is my final cycle of
eligibility for a K99/R00 award. My goal is to establish a laboratory to investigate endolysosomal dysfunction in
multiple genetic models of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). After establishing expertise in this field, I hope to
investigate models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and eventually begin to explore how environmental factors (ex.
exercise, environmental enrichment, etc.) interact with neuronal endolysosomal function to influence behavior.
Training: In addition to my primary mentor, Dr. Erik Roberson, I have assembled an advisory committee that
includes experts on endolysosomal function (Dr. James Collawn) and exosome analysis (Dr. Andrew West), as
well as Dr. David Standaert, the chair of our Department of Neurology with extensive postdoctoral training
experience. I will present at international meetings and take courses (both external and internal to UAB) for
technical training (cell biology, endosomal trafficking, and exosome analysis), professional development (lab
management, budgeting, scientific writing, and the tenure process), and ethical conduct of research.
Research: Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of FTD, and are thought to
cause FTD through progranulin haploinsufficiency. This proposal will test the hypothesis that FTD due to
progranulin (GRN) mutations (FTD-GRN) is caused by endolysosomal dysfunction. We hypothesize that
progranulin insufficiency impairs lysosomal activity, which disrupts late endosomal trafficking and ultimately
causes FTD in humans and disrupts behavior in mice. Progranulin is critical for normal lysosomal function as
complete progranulin deficiency causes a lysosomal storage disorder. In preliminary studies, we have
observed elevated levels of exosome in plasma from FTD-GRN patients, as well as progranulin-insufficient
(Grn+/â€“) mouse plasma and primary neuron culture media. In aim 1, we will test whether this enhanced
exosome production reflects a shift in trafficking of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) away from lysosomal
degradation and toward exosome secretion. In aim 2A we will determine if lysosomal dysfunction causes this
enhanced exosome secretion and in aim 2B we will determine if this endolysosomal dysfunction causes
behavior deficits in Grn+/â€“ mice. In aim 3 we will compare levels of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins and MVB
morphology in brains of FTD-GRN patients with healthy controls and Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients to control for
nonspecific effects of neurodegeneration. These studies will give me experience with primary neuronal culture,
endosomal tracking analysis, shRNA gene knockdown, and exosome isolation and analysis.","Project Narrative
Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and
cause FTD through progranulin haploinsufficiency. This study will test the hypothesis that progranulin
insufficiency causes FTD by impairing lysosomal activity and disrupting endosomal trafficking. This study will
enhance our understanding of FTD pathogenesis, inform development of treatments for FTD due to GRN
mutations, and could potentially lay the foundation for development of biomarker assays.",2019,249000,180643,68357,Non-SBIR/STTR,R00,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD); Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,Andrew Emmett Arrant
1U34DK117128-01A1,Acute Renal Injury Sequelae in NICU Graduates (ARISING),"The scientific premise for this proposal is that prenatal factors and neonatal acute kidney injury (nAKI)
significantly contribute to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) graduates. Our
preliminary data suggests that up to 25% of neonates develop nAKI, which is associated with mortality and CKD.
This NIDDK Multi-Center Clinical Study Implementation Planning Grant (U34) will enable us to achieve specific
milestones in preparation for a U01-funded, multi-center, prospective cohort study. The Acute Renal Injury
Sequela In NICU Graduates (ARISING) study will prospectively capture serum creatinine (SCr) systematically
during the first postnatal week and during high-risk clinical scenarios in 1000 (125 across 8 GA strata)
neonates admitted to the NICU. The project's central purpose is to bridge fundamental knowledge gaps
in the field by providing reliable and precise methods to diagnose nAKI and predict CKD early in the
life of NICU graduates. We propose the following 3 inter-related but independent specific aims.
Aim 1: Validate a novel 2-stage neonatal AKI definition. The contemporary nAKI definition was not developed
with neonatal kidney physiology in mind. Instead, it was adapted from the adult KDIGO AKI definition. Using a
retrospective cohort, we developed a novel nAKI definition using the optimal SCr thresholds which predict
mortality for different gestational age (GA) groups (â‰¤29 and >29 week GA), and postnatal age (< 7 vs ï‚³ 7 days)
 Hypothesis 1a: The NKC mild nAKI definition will have greater sensitivity to predict mortality than the
 stage 1 KDIGO definition
 Hypothesis 1b: The NKC severe nAKI definition will have better specificity to predict mortality than the
 stage 2/3 KDIGO definition
Aim 2: Determine if AKI is independently associated with CKD at 2 years corrected GA (cGA).
Maternal and neonatal risk factors may predispose infants to both nAKI and CKD. We will determine the
attributable risk of nAKI on CKD (estimated GFR<90 ml/min/1.73m2, urine protein/creatinine >0.2, blood
pressure >95th%tile, and/or total kidney volume (TKV) <95th%tile at 2 years corrected gestational age (cGA).
Our hypothesis is that nAKI is associated with a composite CKD after controlling for prenatal factors.
Aim 3: Determine which variable(s) available prior to hospital discharge predict CKD at 2 years cGA.
We will evaluate metrics of kidney health (TKV, BP, proteinuria, cystatin C, SCr and urine kidney biomarkers)
at 38 ï‚± 1 week cGA for preterm and 44 ï‚± 1 weeks cGA for term infants. Our hypothesis is that we can predict
with 90% certainty which infants will have composite CKD at 2 years cGA using biological/radiologic markers of
kidney disease obtained at term cGA.
Answers to these questions are greatly needed to help clinicians provide appropriate and timely care, and help
researchers develop interventions designed to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5P20DK119788-02,Influence of Obesity on Endogenous Oxalate Synthesis,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of both obesity and kidney stone disease has been steadily increasing in the U.S. over the past
several decades. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type including the obese cohort. There is
increasing evidence that obesity is associated with increased urinary oxalate excretion, an important risk factor
for calcium oxalate stone formation. To address this issue we are establishing a Center that has been given the
acronym COOKS (Center for research on Obesity and Oxalate Kidney Stones). This Center, which includes a
scientific research project and an administrative core with an educational enrichment program, will examine
relationships between obesity and endogenous oxalate synthesis. This will be accomplished by composing a
synergistic, interdisciplinary group, including scientists with a unique background in oxalate research and an
obesity expert, who is a core director in the UAB Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) and the Diabetic
Research Center (DRC). The Center will also interact with other UAB NIH funded Centers. The results of this
synergistic research effort will be utilized to generate a future competitive R01 submission and possibly a
Program Project Grant. The Scientific Research project will involve a mouse model and the phenotyping of
human subjects with varying degrees of obesity. Unique facilities in the NORC will be used in both models
including imaging to assess body fat composition and distribution. Insulin sensitivity in the human subjects will
be assessed in the DRC. The administration of a controlled low oxalate diet will be used to estimate endogenous
oxalate synthesis in both models. The administration of 13C-labelled oxalate precursors will be used to assess
levels of endogenous oxalate production. Our preliminary data support a direct relationship between obesity and
the amount of urinary oxalate excreted derived from endogenous oxalate production. The administrative core
will provide oversight of research and educational activities of COOKS. It will also be responsible for financial
management, maintenance of collaborations, and communication with other pertinent NIDDK-sponsored centers
and program officials. The education enrichment program will be broad based. A website will be developed to
profile the centers research and accomplishments, promote educational events and disseminate information to
the Urologic community and public. The data generated in these studies should increase our understanding of
the relationships between obesity and endogenous oxalate synthesis and serve as a platform to develop novel
therapies for stone prevention.","OVERALL: NARRATIVE
Approximately 10% of people in the United States develop kidney stones. It is an extremely painful condition for
which medical costs for care are very high and which is seen more frequently in obese subjects. The research
proposed by this Center will help find out why kidney stones form, what is the link with obesity and hopefully find
new ways of preventing them in the future.",2019,292979,215278,104410,Research Centers,P20,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,DEAN GEORGE ASSIMOS

5U01NS095678-05,Blocking Arsenicals-induced Cutaneous Injury,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arsenicals, such as lewisite, diethylchloroarsine, diphenyl chlorarsine, and diphenyl cyanoarsine have been identified as potential war-threat agents, which could be used in chemical warfare. Topical exposure to these agents is known to result in severe cutaneous blistering and inflammation. In this application, we will test whether these arsenicals as listed above cause similar multiple cutaneous blistering and inflammatory effects in murine (haired but shaved) and mini-pig models as reported in humans. We will also investigate the molecular mechanisms by which these effects are manifested in these animal model systems. Our preliminary data indicate that in hairless murine model arsenicals by penetrating skin, rupture the cutaneous barrier functions as a consequence of disruption of proteins associated with tight junctions and water/glycerin transport. These effects are mediated mainly via activation of hippo signaling pathway protein, Yap besides others. Our data also show that the acute inflammation is mediated through the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. UPR pathway is triggered by the arsenicals-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of DNA damage response signaling. Based on these preliminary results, we will unravel whether crosstalk between these intricate signaling pathways results in the pathogenesis of painful blisters and inflammation. Based on these novel data, it is also tempting to investigate whether blocking these molecular targets by small molecules such as UPR signaling inhibitors also known as chemical chaperones, 4- phenylbutyric acid and salubrinal alone or in combination with arsenic chelator, British anti-lewisite (BAL) or antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine may intercept these effects. This will provide a molecular pathogenesis-based translational approach to develop effective interceptors/antidotes for blocking painful severe skin damage following cutaneous exposure to these chemicals. We are also proposing to test whether cutaneous exposure to these chemicals manifests systemic damage and whether topical application of these antidotes can prevent systemic effects of these chemicals. Three specific aims, each with their own milestones, are proposed to unravel the mechanism of pathogenesis by arsenicals in two animal models and to develop potential antidotes against these agents with defined window of their effectiveness. It is highly likely thatif found effective, the lead compounds based on their known toxicity profile and FDA approved use for other cutaneous blistering and inflammation-unrelated conditions can easily be approved. The outcome of the proposed research is likely to have a significant impact on human health protection in the unfortunate event of mass population exposure to this category of war-threat chemicals.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The successful completion of the proposed studies will provide an in-depth understanding of pathogenesis of skin and other systemic lesions and will develop novel mechanism-based small molecules that can attenuate the pathogenesis of painful cutaneous blistering/inflammation by this class of potential chemical warfare agents.

5U54ES030246-02,Core 4: Animal Breeding (UAB) and Exposure Core (MRIGLOBAL),"The major objectives of the Animal and Exposure Core-4 of the UAB Research Center of
Excellence in Arsenicals are to support all scientific Projects and Drug Discovery and
Development Core-3, as the success of the studies proposed within this Center application
depend on the availability of sufficient animals in a timely manner, as well as the timely
coordination with MRIGlobal for animal exposure to arsenicals. MRIGlobal has more than 60
years of corporate experience in management and operations of chemical agent facilities and
associated projects. We bring to CACT-funded programs, proficiencies in small and large animal
chemical agent models, test and evaluation, safe handling of chemical warfare agent (CWA)
compounds, compounds with extreme toxicity, toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), and emerging
chemical threats. Core-4 will generate a colony of animals of the desired size by assessing the
requirement of each Project in the beginning of each year. Animals will be transported to
MRIGlobal on a predefined time schedule. Once the animals have been exposed to arsenicals
and their initial gross data pertaining to skin damage recorded, the animals will be euthanized by
the staff at MRIGlobal and the harvested tissues and body fluids will be transported back to UAB.
In addition, MRIGlobal will synthesize and store the arsenicals used for these animal studies for
which they have facilities which approved by appropriate agencies. Core-4 will establish a
biorepository on the UAB campus in which to store the returned tissue and body fluid samples as
well as other samples generated directly by the Projects. Samples will be barcoded and banked
in our laboratory. In addition, Core-4 will conduct the in vivo screening of agents that are
synthesized by Drug Discovery and Development Core-3 and found to be highly effective in
attenuating molecular targets in vitro. Accordingly, three specific aims of this core include: 1: To
breed and ship animals for arsenicals exposure at MRIGlobal under approved animal protocols
of UAB and MRIGlobal; 2: Coordinate with MRIGlobal for animal exposure to arsenicals, initial
gross skin data collection, and return shipment to UAB of samples or healed animals for proper
banking and distribution or further toxicity assessment, respectively; and 3: To perform in vivo
screening of novel agents developed in Drug Discovery and Development Core-3.",,2019,564801,452583,112218,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense,Mohammad  Athar
5U54ES030246-02,UAB Research Center of Excellence in Arsenicals,"Vesicants were developed as chemical weapons to debilitate the military and civilian populations during World
War-I/II as these chemicals cause rapid and severe painful inflammatory and blistering responses in the skin.
These agents include mustards and arsenicals. Among them sulfur mustard and lewisite were weaponized as
single agents as well as a mixture of the two. The only known antidote for arsenicals is British Anti-lewisite (BAL),
which is not very effective and itself is highly toxic. The molecular pathogenesis of arsenicals remains poorly
understood, which is also an important impediment in developing mechanism-based antidotes for mitigating the
toxicity of these chemicals. Therefore, the major goal of this U54 Center is to develop mechanism-based highly
efficacious antidotes against chemical war relevant arsenicals namely lewisite, diphenylchloroarsine,
diphenylcynoarsine and diethylchloroarsine (as prioritized by the NIH CounterACT program). The scientific
premise of this investigation lies in the strong and compelling preliminary data demonstrating that epigenetic
regulation of molecular signaling pathways regulate arsenicals-mediated onset of aberrant and robust cutaneous
inflammation and tissue damage. These data also indicate that recruitment of bromodomain 4 (BRD4) to
promotor region of inducible genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of arsenicals-mediated multi-organ
damage including skin, lung and kidney. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a murine model that
recapitulates the tissue damaging acute as well as delayed responses of these arsenicals described in exposed
humans. Three specific aims are proposed. In specific aim-1, studies are focused to fully characterize the animal
model of arsenicals-mediated acute and delayed cutaneous, pulmonary and renal damage following skin
exposure to these chemical vesicants. This will be achieved by defining molecular biomarkers and epigenetic
marks associated with the progression of the damage. Specific aim-2 will define molecular mechanism of
arsenicals' toxicity with an objective for developing novel mechanism-based pharmacological inhibitors that can
mitigate arsenicals' toxicity including cutaneous, pulmonary and renal injury. Studies in specific aim-3 are related
to defining window of effective therapeutic intervention of pharmacological inhibitors of BDR4 in terms of
suppressing cutaneous, pulmonary and renal damage following skin exposure to these chemicals. The outcome
of this study will lead to paradigm shift discovery of antidotes against arsenicals which could block effectively
multi-organ damage, morbidity, and mortality. These inhibitors could also provide efficacy against other similar
chemicals. In addition, based on the discovery of novel molecular targets, synthesis and characterization of small
molecules will done by the Drug Discovery and Development Core. These antidotes could easily be delivered
subcutaneously by auto-injectable FDA approved devices in case of mass causality. Thus these efforts will
significantly enhance the medical response capabilities in tackling vesicants' exposure to public or soldiers in a
terrorist attack or during chemical warfare.","Arsenicals such as lewisite are vesicants or blistering agents which cause severe inflammation and blistering of the skin and also manifest systemic injury. The major goal of the UAB Research Center of Excellence in Arsenicals is to develop mechanism-based highly efficacious medical countermeasures against arsenicals lewisite, diphenylchloroarsine, diphenylcynoarsine and diethylchloroarsine.

5R01ES026219-04,Chemoprevention of environmental UVB-induced skin cancer in immunosuppressed mice,"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), which include both basal cell (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas
(SCCs), are the most common skin neoplasm. Environmental ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure is the main etiologic
factor for these skin cancers. However, other environmental and genetic factors also affect their susceptibility.
In organ transplant recipients (OTRs) the incidence of these cancers increases by 10 to 250 fold. In addition,
these tumors become more aggressive/invasive and metastatic ultimately contributing to augmented morbidity
and mortality in this already morbid population. These cancers in OTRs are not only originated from the
carcinogenic exposure of the transplant recipient but may also be contributed by the donor organ. Circulating
tumor cells have also been found in these patients. At present at least 500,000 OTRs are living in the USA
and their number is growing every year. Skin cancer is the most frequently occurring neoplasm in this
population. Therefore, prevention of skin cancer is desperately required in this population. Oral retinoid showed
some success in this regard however, their administration cause severe toxicity particularly hyperlipidemia.
Here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, we have developed a relatively non-toxic retinoid without
compromising its efficacy. UAB30, a 9-cis retinoic acid was found to be well-tolerated in humans and in
experimental animals and showed no significant toxicity as compared to placebo group. We, therefore propose
here to test the hypothesis that UAB30 may be highly effective in preventing BCCs and SCCs in chronically
immuno-suppressed mice and acts by inducing DNA damage response (DDR) signaling besides activating
RAR/RXR pathway. For this, we have developed novel genetically engineered Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 mice, which
following chronic UVB irradiation, develop both BCCs and SCCs. We also have compelling preliminary data to
support our hypothesis. Three specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the effects of UAB30
on development of BCCs/SCCs in chronically immuno-suppressed UVB-irradiated Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 mice.
Specific Aim 2 will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which UAB30 mediates skin cancer prevention.
In preliminary studies, we found that UAB30 induces DDR signaling. We will therefore assess whether these
responses are identical in immuno-competent and immuno-suppressed animals. Specific Aim 3 will unravel the
molecular basis for the pharmacological action of UAB30 in the experiment settings of normal and immuno-
suppression using in vitro/in vivo approaches. We will study whether alterations fanconi anemia DNA damage
repair pathway are important mechanistic component underlying efficacy of UAB30. In summary, studies
proposed here will not only demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of UAB30 in chronically immuno-suppressed
mice but will also address its molecular mechanism dependent/independent of RAR/RXR.","Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) including both basal cell (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas

5P01CA210946-03,Core 3: Rexinoid Screening and Animal Core,"The Rexinoid Screening and Animal Core (Animal Core) is a critical component of the Program
Project Grant. It supports the goals and objectives of the Program by providing pre-clinical
efficacy and safety information on novel rexinoids, designed by Project 2, that have the potential
to be useful as chemopreventive agents for non-melanoma skin cancers in organ transplant
recipients. Effective dose 50 (ED50) for prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in normal and
cyclosporine-treated mice will be established for each candidate rexinoid; the ED50 of our
current lead compound, UAB30, which will be used as a comparator. Pharmacokinetics,
tolerability, organ toxicity and lipid abnormalities of the newly synthesized rexinoids will also be
determined. Another service provided by the Rexinoid Screening and Animal Core is to
maintain a colony of Ptch+/-/SKH1 mice. Following chronic exposure to UV radiation, these mice
develop basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and premalignant actinic keratoses.
Thus, they carefully replicate human skin cancer susceptibility to UV. Maintaining a breeding
colony of these unique mice will be particularly important for the experiments proposed in

5U54ES030246-02,Project 1: Novel Pharmacological Inhibitors of Chemical Vesicants-mediated Cutaneous Injury,"The class of chemical war-threat agents known as vesicants include among others arsenicals and mustard
agents. Stockpiles of weaponized arsenic-based vesicants developed for World War II still exist. Recently,
vesicants have been used against civilian populations in Iraq and Syria and caused extensive morbidities and a
few casualties. Cutaneous exposure to arsenicals causes vesicular skin lesions, blisters, and painful cutaneous
inflammation, which progresses to multi-organ tissue disruption and death. Four major arsenicals, lewisite,
diphenylchlorarsine, diphenylcyanoarsine and diethylchloroarsine, have been identified as potential threat
chemicals by NIH CounterACT program for which antidotes/agents are highly sought. However, the mechanisms
by which these arsenicals manifest such robust deleterious effects in the skin remain undefined. We have
recently developed a highly sensitive murine model of cutaneous arsenical exposure, which recapitulates skin
pathology of humans exposed to these chemicals. Our preliminary studies indicate that the acute inflammatory
and tissue damaging effects caused by arsenicals are mediated through the rapid onset of epigenetic
modifications and chromatin remodeling via histone lysine hyperacetylation. In this regard, bromodomain 4
(BRD4), a reader of histone acetylation marks is considered to be one of the potent transcriptional regulator of
inducible inflammatory genes besides others. In this Project-I of U54, we propose to investigate histone
acetylation-based epigenetic alterations involved in the molecular pathogenesis of skin lesions and development
of antidotes that can block arsenical-induced cutaneous injury. Three specific aims are proposed: 1: To
characterize histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling-associated with arsenical exposure. This data will
provide a correlation between the spatiotemporal regulation of histone acetylation and underlying arsenicals-
induced cutaneous injury. After establishing these changes in murine skin we will confirm the molecular
pathogenesis of acute skin injury by arsenicals in minipig; 2: To unravel the molecular mechanism by which
arsenicals-mediated histone acetylations affect inflammatory and blistering responses. We will probe the
mechanisms by which arsenicals induce BRD4 activation. 3: To define the window of therapeutic intervention
of arsenicals-mediated tissue damage by administering BRD4 inhibitors. Our goal is to fully characterize the
kinetics of action and assess the therapeutic window of time (30, 60 or 120 min after exposure to arsenicals) in
which these BRD4 inhibitors are able to reverse arsenical-induced molecular changes and underlying skin
inflammation/blistering. This project will integrate with projects II, III, and scientific cores as animal tissues will
be shared from topically exposed animals. Therapies successful in reversing skin inflammation/damage will also
be verified for the diminution of lung and kidney injury. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to a
paradigm shift in the existing knowledge of arsenicals' toxicity and development of novel series of mechanism-
based antidotes.",,2019,705969,565703,140266,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Genetics,Mohammad  Athar
5P01CA210946-03,Core 2: RXR Rexinoid Design and Synthesis,"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most common skin malignancy and in organ
transplant patients the incidence of these cancers increase by 10 to 250 fold. The NMSCs in
transplant recipients are more aggressive in behavior. Therefore, prevention of NMSC in
transplant patients is a high priority. While retinoids are generally effective in prevention of
NMSC, these agents are associated with severe lipid toxicities thus precluding them from
chronic administration. The overall objective of the program project is to identify a potent and
safe rexinoid and translate it into clinical use for prevention of NMSCs. Towards achieving this
goal, Core 2 will synthesize rexinoids to support the aims of Project 2, Project 3 and Core 3.
Our laboratory has developed two separate structural classes of rexinoids, which are highly
effective in preventing cancers without increasing the lipid levels. One example of these new
rexinoids is UAB30, which is also being tested against NMSC and is effective in preclinical
models at preventing NMSC without increasing the lipid levels. In addition to UAB30, a second
structural class of retinoids is being developed which are also effective in cancers. Core 2 will
support projects 2, 3 and Core 3 by providing them with required quantities of UAB30 and
UAB110. Core 2 will also synthesize new 3rd generation rexinoids which are more potent and
have an excellent safety profile. The proposed new analogs will utilize structural templates of
UAB30 and UAB110, and add a limited number of substituents. The rationale for the placement
of the substituents is based on our hypothesis that a â€˜hot-spotâ€™ in the ligand binding pocket for

5R01HL118334-05,"Caspase-1, the Microvascular Endothelium, and Infection","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite compelling experimental evidence linking inflammation to the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anti-inflammatory clinical trials have systematically failed to demonstrate beneficial effects in patients. This failure is often ascribed to the interrelated prospects that pan-suppression of inflammation is deleterious or that anti-inflammatories also inhibit protective stress responses. Thus, identifying novel targets to treat ARDS requires an understanding of the basic biology underlying key molecules that drive both pro-inflammatory responses in immune cells and protective stress adaptation programs in non-immune cells. Preliminary Data show that, in addition to inducing pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, Caspase-1 protease activation protects Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (PMVEC) and Pulmonary Arterial Endothelial Cell (PAEC) barrier function in response to infection. Additional data presented herein support a model in which Caspase-1 degrades glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins in PMVECs and PAECs as a protective strategy that limits accumulation of advanced N-glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RS) induced by infection. Intriguingly, the model opportunistic pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and vasculotropic pathogen (Rickettsia prowazekii) used in these studies both deploy homologous secreted phospholipase A2 toxins (ExoU) that inhibit Caspase-1 activation. The proposed experiments will test the Hypothesis that Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs elicits degradation of glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins as an adaptive stress response to protect barrier function. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs by: 1.1) Defining the mechanisms by which PMVECs and PAECs sense infection at the level of Inflammasome signaling using a Split Venus fluorescence complementation reporter. 1.2) Determining mechanisms by which the ExoU secreted toxin inhibits Caspase-1 activation using phospholipase A2 signaling inhibitors. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1-induced stress responses in PMVECs and PAECs by: 2.1) Elucidating glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins degraded by Caspase-1 and validating targets by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme function assays. 2.2) Determining whether Caspase-1 protects PMVEC and PAEC barrier function during infection. Molecular and pharmacologic approaches will be used to either down-regulate or up-regulate Caspase-1 followed by assessment of barrier function, AGEs, and RS. Inhibitors of glycolytic intermediates, AGEs, and/or RS will unveil their roles in barrier demise. Specific Aim 3 will correlate Caspase- 1 activation and mitochondrial function with ARDS patient outcomes by: 3.1) Measuring active Caspase-1 and mitochondrial respiration in immune cells and non-immune cells. 3.2) Correlating outcomes with patient mortality and ventilator-free days. Long-term impact on human health and translational potential lie in identifying targets for therapies to treat ARDS, which are currently lacking.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of lung failure affecting humans, with more than 190,000 reported cases in the U.S. per year. Despite the severity and prevalence of this debilitating and often lethal respiratory condition, there are currently no specific therapies available to facilitate treatment and augment patient recovery.

5R01DA038635-05,Development of Mu Agonist Delta Antagonist Opioids as Analgesics for Chronic Pain,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioids such as morphine are the most potent and efficacious agents currently available for the treatment of moderate to severe acute and chronic pain. These drugs primarily act through the mu subtype of the opioid receptors. However, their therapeutic use is limited due to respiratory depression, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, development of tolerance and dependence, and renewed concerns around addiction liabilities. There is an urgent unmet medical need for the discovery and development of novel analgesics that are as efficacious as morphine but devoid of significant side effects. Delta receptor gene knockout/knockdown experiments and studies using selective antagonists and bifunctional (mu agonist/delta antagonist) compounds have provided evidence that activation of mu receptor function with simultaneous suppression of delta receptor function produces analgesic effects with greatly diminished mu receptor mediated side effects. Thus, compounds possessing dual but opposing functional activity of mu receptor agonism and delta receptor antagonism have the potential to exhibit broad-spectrum analgesia with a wide safety margin and therapeutic index. Therefore, we have been pursuing the discovery of small molecules possessing the dual functional profile of mu agonism/delta antagonism. To this end, we recently discovered compounds possessing a balanced profile of high-affinity binding at mu and delta receptors and possessing mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist functional activity. In addition these compounds had a diminished propensity to produce tolerance, dependence and abuse liability. In this proposed project, our goal is to develop novel orally active mu agonist/delta antagonist compounds. The approach builds upon the structure-activity relationships determined for the lead series. The medicinal chemistry lead optimization strategy includes rational drug design utilizing crystal structure information on mu and delta receptors that became recently available as well as multi- parametric lead optimization for the improvement of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. To achieve the goal of identifying lead preclinical candidates we will (1) design and synthesize new compounds based upon activity and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties (2) perform in vitro screening to determine opioid receptor binding and functional activity (3) determine the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic profile (bioavailability, half-lifeand CNS levels) to select compounds for (4) comprehensive in vivo analgesic efficacy and side effect profiling in rodents. These goals will be accomplished through a collaborative effort involving a team with extensive experience in drug design, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, opioid biochemistry and molecular biology, pharmacokinetics, opioid pharmacology, and drug development.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current treatment options for alleviating severe acute and chronic pain using powerful opioid analgesics such as morphine suffer from limitations caused by their side effects such as respiratory depression, constipation, and the development of tolerance, dependence, and addiction liabilities. Recent research has revealed that compounds that interact with mu opioid receptors as agonists and with delta opioid receptors as antagonists could emerge as powerful analgesics with a diminished propensity to produce such side effects.

5P30AG050886-05,Comparative Energetics and Aging,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes to establish a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging focused on comparative energetics and aging. Energetics is comprehensively defined for this purpose as the study of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the acquisition, storage, and utilization of metabolizable energy. Comparative energetics is the study of metabolic processes at multiple scales and across multiple species, in this case as it relates to health and aging. Nearly a century of aging research has reinforced the link between energetics and aging. In modern terms this link is reified as dysregulated mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and nutrient responsiveness. The twin objectives of the Center will be to (1) explore in
greater depth and detail than previously the complex relationship among cellular and organismal energetics and their relationship to health and aging, and (2) provide quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies and novel methodologies in the assessment and analysis of energetics to the basic aging research community at large. In pursuit of these objectives, we propose developing three research cores. First, the Comparative Organismal Energetics Core will provide expertise and cutting edge instruction and methodology for determining complete whole animal energy balance (intake, assimilation, expenditure) and body composition, including regional distribution of white and brown adipose tissue, in living animals of various species including flies, fish, mice
or other mammals, under any ambient temperature or activity regime. Second, the Comparative Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core will provide integrated, quantitative energetics analysis at the level of the organelle, cell, or tissue for both traditional and emerging animal models, including targeted metabolomics, assessment of mitophagy, and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial-nuclear exchange models are also available to enable experiments that evaluate the contribution of mtDNA variation to bioenergetics. Third, the Comparative Data Analytics Core will provide innovative analytic approaches to data sets linking comparative energetics to organismal health and longevity.  With these research cores plus the administrative and research development core, we aim to: (i) facilitate hypothesis-driven research and leverage these technologies into new projects, interactions, and collaborations nationwide in basic aging research; (ii) foster meaningful novel interactions among investigators within UAB and across the region and country; and (iii) provide resources, education, training, and direction to junior investigators through the intellectual resources and research infrastructure, the Center will develop.  In sum, these cores and the outstanding cohort of investigators assembled for this Center will provide unique expertise and novel collaborative opportunities for new and established investigators at UAB and beyond.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The University of Alabama at Birmingham Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging will provide state-of-the-art research services as well as diverse cells and animals for researchers investigating the links between energetics, healthspan and the rate of aging.",2019,506896,515299,182653,Research Centers,P30,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,352940001,,STEVEN N.

5R21AG058811-02,A Four Core Genotype (FCG) Approach to Investigating Sex Differences in Health and Longevity,"Project Summary
 Lifespan, healthspan, and the mechanisms that modulate them often vary between the sexes. This is
particularly true of humansâ€”women consistently outlive men in every modern society and historical period.
The sexes also vary in their response to potentially senescence-modulating interventions and numerous
studies have reported a significant life- or health-extending effect in one sex only. To date, 6 compounds
evaluated by the NIA Intervention Testing Program have successfully extended lifespan in mice and all
affected one sex more than the other. Surprisingly, given their near ubiquity, sex differences in response to
lifespan-extending genetic or pharmacological interventions have gone largely unstudied. While such
differences are of interest in their own right and are likely to be important for the development of senescence-
retarding interventions in humans, sex differences can also be used as a tool to fill gaps in our understanding
of specific mechanisms of aging. If manipulation of parts of a biochemical networkâ€”either by genetic or
pharmacological targetingâ€”affects health and longevity in one sex only, then by examining how that
manipulation affects downstream targets in a sex-specific manner we can learn how specific components of
the network impact health and longevity. Thus, sex-specific responses to senescence-retarding interventions
can be used to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in aging. This
proposal exploits a unique mouse model, the Four Core Genotypes (FCG), in which sex chromosome
complement is independent of gonadal sex. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that mechanisms
underlying the sex-specific effects of health and longevity interventions in mice can be revealed and evaluated
by investigating the health and downstream effectors of life-extending interventions in the FCG mice. We
propose to evaluate this hypothesis using 17Î±-estradiol (17Î±-E2), which extends lifespan in males only, via the
following Specific Aims (SAs). SA1 will test the hypothesis that metabolism, inflammatory response and
specific nodes in the mTOR and associated pathways are differentially responsive to hormonal and sex
chromosome manipulations using the FCG mice treated with 17Î±-E2 and surgical castration to uncover these
sex-specific effects. SA2 will use an acute stressor, infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, to investigate
whether the sex-specific responses observed in SA1 are predictive of improved health and survival under a
clinically relevant challenge involving inflammation and immune function, hallmarks of aging.","Project Narrative

5R01AG057434-03,A sex difference approach to evaluating resilience as a predictor of healthspan in mice,"Project Summary
 Aging of the human population has become the number one threat to human health globally as life
expectancy is rising rapidly and because aging underlies nearly all major causes of death, disability, and
degradation of the quality of later life. Hope for amelioration of this trend lies with the development of
treatments that enhance and extend health. A major limitation on evaluating promising compounds for their
senescence-inhibiting properties is the time it takes to perform lifespan studies in mice, the main preclinical
animal model employed in biomedical research. Similarly, once compounds are ready for human testing, the
time it takes to complete clinical trials will also become a bottleneck. In order to speed progress in the field
then, it would be invaluable to develop a panel of short-term assays that could be administered to mice in
early- to mid-life that would predict whether or not an intervention will extend healthspan in mice. The ability of
an organism to recover from acute physical challenges or stresses is well-known to decline with age. If we
define resilience as a quantitative metric which gauges the ability and speed of an organism to return to
homeostasis after physical stress or challenge, then life- and health-extending interventions generally enhance
resilience. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a standardized challenge or panel of challenges
and their accompanying recovery metrics that will be informative about the healthspan impact of putative
health-extending interventions when administered in early-to-mid life. The overarching hypothesis of the
proposed research is that resilience assays can be developed that singly, or in combination, predict future life-
and/or health-span. We propose to evaluate our overarching hypothesis purposely focusing on resilience
assays with translational potential by performing the following specific aims (SAs). SA 1 will optimize resilience
assay protocols, each consisting of an acute physical challenge and associated recovery metrics as to the best
age and severity of challenge to use. SA 2 will determine whether the resilience assays optimized in specific
aim 1 can identify the impact of known life- or health-span extension treatments. Three such treatments will be
compared to untreated controls. These are: (a) dietary restriction (DR). This can be thought of as a positive
control. To be informative, our resilience assays should predict longer life in both sexes; (b) rapamycin, our
resilience assays should predict longer life in both sexes, but a greater effect in females; and (c) 17-Î±-estradiol.
Our resilience assays should predict longer life in males only. SA 3 will evaluate the robustness of the most
successful resilience assays identified in specific aim 2 across mouse genotypes. Because humans are so
genetically and environmentally diverse, the generality of mouse assays should be maximized to the extent
possible. Diverse mouse genotypes are available to access whether the assays developed in aim 2 are
idiosyncratic to the original test genotype or robust as we would want for human trials.","Project Narrative

Abstract: 
 Precise genetic manipulation of the pig genome through a combination of somatic cell 
nuclear transfer and sophisticated gene modification tools offers the opportunity to provide an 
unlimited source of human-compatible donor organs, cells, and tissues for transplantation. As 
Core A, Revivicor will apply their advanced transgenic pig production platform to provide the GE 
source pig organs (kidney, heart, lung, and liver) necessary to meet the goals of the specific 
aims in Project 1 and Project 2. Elimination of immunogenic GalÎ±1,3Gal (Gal) sugars through 
inactivation of the Î±1,3-galactosyl transferase gene (GTKO) was a critical first step, resulting in 
the elimination of hyperacute rejection (HAR), and prolonged survival of xenografts in non- 
human primate studies, compared to wild-type controls. To provide further protection protection 
from non-gal-mediated humoral rejection, next-generation GTKO pigs were produced with 
constitutive high-level expression of the complement regulatory genes, hCD46 and hCD55, 
individually and as triple transgenic pigs. In addition, for inhibition of coagulation and 
thrombosis, human anti-coagulant genes (EPCR, CD39, TFPI, and thrombomodulin), under 
endothelial cell-specific promoter systems, were added alone or in combination to produce 
donor pigs with up to six genetic modifications. 
 The use of multi-cistronic â€œ2Aâ€ vectors has facilitated the production of these multi- 
transgenic pigs in which the added genes are not only co-expressed, but co-integrated in the 
genome, thus allowing propagation of new lines with reduced transgene segregation. Core A 
will utilize this multi-transgenic 2A pig platform to produce multiple combinations of six-gene 
(6GE) pigs that have already shown improved efficacy, and will further modify the source pig to 
inhibit T cell activation (expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of SLA class II (CIITA), and 
immunomodulation, through overexpression of the â€œcloaking geneâ€, human CD47, to prevent 
activation of monocytes and other immune cells. In addition, towards prevention of 
spontaneous aggregation and sequestration of recipient platelets (and resulting 
thrombocytopenia in NHP), specific exons of porcine vWF will be replaced by their human 
equivalents using gene editing nuclease technologies. Core A will identify the optimal multi- 
gene mix, with an efficacious balance of gene expression levels, bioactivity, and synergistic 
effects, while maintaining a healthy herd, as needed to support the aims of Project 1 & 2.",,2019,175000,175000,0,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biotechnology; Genetics; Hematology; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation,David  Ayares
5R21AA026906-02,Molecular circadian clocks and alcohol-induced liver injury,"Excessive alcohol consumption remains a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Alcoholic
liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality from heavy alcohol drinking and is the most
prevalent cause of liver disease-related death. Despite increased understanding of the many cellular and
molecular events occurring in ALD, the causal mechanisms remain elusive, especially with regards to the
factors responsible for disease progression and severity. To advance mechanistic understanding of this
serious liver disease, the current proposal will investigate the importance of circadian clock disruption and
`time-of-day' as critical risk factors for ALD. These views stem from the growing recognition that circadian clock
disruption is linked to numerous pathologies and diseases. One essential function of the molecular circadian
clock is to provide a selective advantage of anticipation, allowing for rapid and temporally appropriate
adaptation to metabolic stress, immune challenges, and environmental insults. When these processes fail,
disease ensues. We propose that perturbation of circadian clocks underlie many of the metabolic and
inflammatory events contributing to alcohol-induced liver injury. As such, we will determine the role of the
hepatocyte clock and the monocyte clock in alcohol-induced liver injury. In support of this concept, we have
found that the circadian clock is significantly altered in livers of chronic alcohol-fed mice, genetic disruption of
the liver clock increases levels of hepatic inflammatory mediators, and alcohol-induced liver injury and
steatosis are elevated in mice with a disrupted liver clock. Furthermore, studies show that disruptions in normal
time-of-day patterns in alcohol drinking increases risk for ALD and binge alcohol drinking is now recognized to
be harmful to health. Collectively, these observations have led us to hypothesize that circadian clock disruption
exacerbates alcohol-induced liver injury and inflammation. Similarly, we propose that the magnitude of alcohol
toxicity is dependent on the time of day of alcohol ingestion. We will test these hypotheses through two specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will mechanistically show the critical role of cell autonomous clocks in chronic alcohol-
induced liver injury by using two genetic mouse models, the hepatocyte-specific BMAL1 knockout mouse and
the monocyte (myeloid cell)-specific BMAL1 knockout mouse. In Aim 2, we will use the `chronic + binge'
alcohol model and determine the `window' or time of day that the liver is most sensitive to alcohol binge
toxicity. Successful completion of this project will reveal the importance of cell-specific circadian clocks in
alcohol-mediated tissue injury and inflammation and show that `time-of-day' is a significant risk factor for liver
injury from binge alcohol drinking. Our long-term goal is that the scientific knowledge gained from these pre-
clinical animal studies will lead to future translational investigations using various chronobiology-based
therapeutic approaches for treatment of ALD and other related liver diseases.","Excessive alcohol use remains a top ten cause of preventable death in the United States; sadly we still do not
fully understand the mechanisms responsible for alcohol toxicity and there are few effective treatments. The
studies in this research proposal are important as they will address the exciting new hypothesis that circadian
clock disruption and the time of day at which alcohol is consumed significantly influence alcohol-induced liver
injury. Importantly, the new scientific information gained from this research will help scientists and medical
professionals better understand the causes of liver disease and lead to the discovery of new treatments for
patients suffering from liver diseases associated with many conditions including diabetes, obesity, hepatitis C,

5R01NR013665-05,ENABLE: CHF-PC (Comprehensive Heartcare For Patients and Caregivers),"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Almost 5 million Americans, most over age 65, carry a diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Despite treatment advances, 50% will die within 5 years; increasing age and rural environment are risk factors associated with the greatest HF morbidity and mortality. In the year before death, HF patients will experience multiple hospitalizations and personal and economic costs of unrelieved physical and emotional suffering. Currently, only 19% of Medicare-aged HF patients (and their family caregivers) access beneficial palliative care services, compared with more than half of advanced cancer patients. Older patients with HF and their caregivers, rarely have access to palliative supportive care services because the disease is unpredictable and palliative treatment may not be provided until after other medical treatments have been tried. We and others have demonstrated in advanced cancer that concurrent palliative care achieves beneficial outcomes in quality of life (QOL), symptom burden, depression, and in some case survival. The intervention is adapted from our successful palliative care model for cancer (ENABLE: Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before-Life- Ends). Our overall goal is to test the efficacy of a concurrent HF palliative care model in reducing the morbidity of living with advanced HF. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare the quality of life, symptom burden, mood, and the quality of chronic illness and end-of-life care in 380 older adults with NYHA stage III/IV HF and 228 caregivers. Half of the patient participants (n=190) will be randomized to the intervention and half (n=190) will receive usual HF care. The specific aims of the RCT; ENABLE: CHF-PC (Comprehensive Heart care for Patients and Caregivers), are to 1) Determine whether ENABLE: CHF-PC leads to higher advanced HF patient-reported QOL and mood (depression/anxiety); and lower symptom burden and resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) at 8 and 16 weeks after baseline and to 2) Determine whether ENABLE: CHF-PC leads to higher caregiver-reported QOL, mood (anxiety/depression), and self-reported health and lower caregiver burden at 8 and 16 weeks after baseline. The relevance of this research to public health is that there is an urgent need to improve the routine care of older adults in rural areas with advanced heart failure and their caregivers. This study will contribute substantially to that effort.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Advanced heart failure affects nearly 6 million Americans, and less is known about how this illness affects the 80% of heart failure patients who are 65 years and older because research tends to focus on younger patients. Older patients with heart failure and their family caregivers, rarely have access to palliative supportive care services because the disease is unpredictable and palliative treatment may not be provided until after other medical treatments have been tried. We are studying whether palliative care provided when advanced heart failure patients are still well will result in better quality of life, mood and
less symptom distress compared to usual heart failure care.",2019,683149,464727,218422,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Nursing Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF NURSING,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Caregiving Research; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Depression; Health Services; Heart Disease; Mental Health; Rural Health,Marie Anne Bakitas
5P30AG031054-12,Research Education Core,"Project Summary/Abstract â€“ Research Education Component
The Research Education Component (REC) of the Deep South RCMAR is designed to recruit, educate, and
support a diverse group of faculty at our four partnering institutions (The University of Alabama at Birmingham,
Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The University of Alabama) in the pursuit of
enduring research careers focused on reducing health disparities between African American (AA) and White
older adults in the Deep South (a region of the country where the majority of older AAs live and health
disparities have been particularly persistent). This unique collaboration between institutions that vary greatly in
their research emphasis, research infrastructure, and faculty backgrounds will increase the pool of potential
applications to the program. Each partnering institution brings unique strengths to the overall educational
experience. The benefits of this collaboration for the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
include exposure to more researchers with R01 experience and a greater depth and breadth in senior faculty
available to serve as mentors. The strengths of the minority institutions to the collaboration include providing a
pool of faculty experienced in cultural sensitivity and committed to aging research leading to the reduction of
health inequities. Additionally, TU brings unique strength in bioethics training, a key component for scientists
interested in addressing health disparities in the Deep South. The overall goals of the REC are to (1) build
research capacity and increase the diversity of the workforce through the recruitment of minority investigators
and the education of a diverse group of faculty Scientists, (2) build research capacity through mentoring by
providing opportunities for RCMAR Scientists to work on interdisciplinary teams, exposing them to the
methodologies and theories of other scientific disciplines pertinent to the study of age-related phenomena, (3)
support our Scientists in pursuing independent careers in aging and health disparities research through
ongoing mentoring, while fostering networks for ongoing collaboration and support, and (4) build research
capacity through research funding for pilot grants, and assistance in the submission of competitive research
projects over time. To insure the success of the REC, we will draw from a large pool of established mentors at
all partnering institutions, who offer many opportunities for RCMAR Scientists to participate in large,
collaborative research programs. We will carefully evaluate the program through various indicators of Scientist
career independence including publications, successful grant applications, promotions in rank, and service in
the academic community through editorial board memberships and participation on study sections. In these
ways, the RCMAR REC will help diversify the cadre of scientists engaged in aging research, with the ultimate
goal of reducing health inequities in the older population. Through improving the diversity of scientists trained
in this area of research, the expectation is that global competitiveness will be improved, scientific innovation
will be enhanced, and older adults will benefit.",,2019,169821,157242,12579,Research Centers,P30,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Rural Health,KARLENE K BALL
5R01AI110480-05,Regulation of T-cell dependent B cell responses to influenza,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The generation of long-lived, high affinity antibodies (Ab) is required for protective immunity to most viruses and for protection after vaccination. Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that control the generation of long-lasting protective Ab responses. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a distinct CD4+ T cell subset that expresses high levels of CXCR5 and localizes in the B cell follicles, play an essential role on promoting long-lived Ab responses. In fact, in the absence of Tfh cells, long-term Ab responses are impaired and protection to pathogens compromised. Therefore, it is essential that we understand how to manipulate Tfh responses in order to improve the efficacy of vaccines. However, despite significant advances in the field, our understanding of how Tfh cells responses are initiated is very limited. Recent studies suggest that Tfh cells are initially primed
by dendritic cells (DCs), suggesting that we may be able to develop adjuvants that preferentially activate DCs to promote Tfh cell priming, or target vaccine antigens to those DCs that preferentially induce Tfh cells. Unfortunately, we do not know what signals direct the DCs to promote Tfh cell differentiation or which specific subsets of DCs prime Tfh cell responses. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how virus-specific Tfh cells are primed by DCs, which will help us to determine the nature of adjuvants that can be used to boost Tfh cell responses. Importantly, whereas some studies suggest that Tregs, particularly the T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells, suppress Tfh and GC B cell responses, we recently found that Tregs promote Tfh and B cell responses to influenza. Mechanistically, Tregs favored influenza-specific Tfh cell development by limiting the physiological availability of IL-2, a potent suppressor of Tfh
cell differentiation. Thus, in addition to DCs, Tregs are also required for normal Tfh cell responses. The central hypothesis that will be tested in this proposal is that Tfh cells are primed
within particular low-IL-2 microenvironments outside the T cell area, where coordinated encounters between ""pro-Tfh DCs"" (which provide ""pro-Tfh"" signals) and Tregs (which consume IL-2) allow Tfh cell differentiation. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will first identify the specific DC subsets and activation state of DC that is required to prime Tfh cell responses, and the molecular mechanisms by which DC/Tregs/IL-2 interplay regulates this process. In Aim 2 we will determine the chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions that orchestrate ""pro-Tfh DC"" and Tregs encounters outside the T cell zone. In Aim 3 we will determine how IL-2 and other factors control the development of TFRs (which inhibit Tfh cell responses), so we can prevent TFR differentiation after vaccination. We believe that our work will significantly contribute to our understanding of how Tfh cell responses are initiated and reveal new strategies to elicit long-lived Ab responses to infection and vaccination. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on previously ignored, yet profoundly important, aspects of Tfh cell biology.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: T follicular helper cells (Tfh) are required to generate long-live antibody responses, which confer long-term protection to respiratory viruses. Thus, understanding how Tfh responses are initiated will allow us to design more efficient vaccines to pathogens such influenza virus, which is responsible for an average of 35,000 deaths annually in the US and has the potential of trigger world-wide pandemics. This proposal will determine the mechanisms by which Dendritic Cells prime Tfh cell response after influenza infection and how IL-2 signaling modulates this process.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS),Andre  Ballesteros-Tato

5I01RX002745-02,Genetics of Osteoarthritis and Joint Replacement Recovery: Key to Precision Rehabilitation,"The societal and patient-centered impacts of end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) among Veterans â€“ including a
significant proportion suffering from post-traumatic arthritis â€“ are profound: (i) VA healthcare costs for
treatment exceed $880 million annually; (ii) ~30% of Veterans in the VA healthcare system have OA, which is
a significantly higher rate than the general population; (iii) each year, 10,000 Veterans with end-stage arthritis
undergo total hip (n~3500) or knee (n~6500) arthroplasty (THA/TKA) and subsequent rehabilitation; (iv)
Veterans who undergo THA/TKA experience profound deficits in health-related quality of life (HRQL), severe
functional limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), increased healthcare utilization, and higher incidence of
comorbidities and hospitalization; and (v) incidence of moderate-severe functional limitations 2-5 years post-
surgery is 30-35% post-THA and 46-50% post-TKA despite prescribed rehabilitation. OA has a strong genetic
component with heritability estimates >30%. Pain is the most common symptom, contributing to disability and
decreased HRQL. Major phenotypic predictors of post-THA/TKA mobility limitation and pain have been
identifed. However, genetic predictors of both the progression of OA and success of THA/TKA recovery are as
yet unknown. Such discovery would fuel progress toward precision pre-habilitation and post-surgical
rehabilitation among Veterans. We seek to leverage the rich MVP resource to test the overarching
hypothesis that genetic variants explain a meaningful proportion of OA prevalence, progression to end-stage
disease leading to THA/TKA, and recovery success. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims.
Aim 1: To identify genetic variants associated with OA. We will perform GWAS in 292,516 MVP participants
40-80 years of age â€“ of which 90,000 carry an OA diagnosis â€“ in an effort to replicate known and identify new
genetic variants and regions associated with OA. As a secondary analysis, we will perform GWAS to identify
genetic variants associated with OA among 3,696 Veterans with post-traumatic arthritis. We will attempt to
replicate significant findings using data on 392,304 individuals in the UK Biobank, of which 41,217 have OA.
Aim 2: To identify genetic variants prognostic of progression to end-stage OA, as indicated by THA/TKA. We
will perform GWAS in the 90,000 MVP participants with OA to identify variants associated with reaching the
end-stage (i.e. THA/TKA). Within this cohort with diagnosed OA, we will identify genetic variants unique to the
subpopulation that progressed to end-stage â€“ i.e. the 7,600 MVP participants who have undergone THA or
TKA subsequent to OA diagnosis. As a secondary analysis, we will perform GWAS to identify genetic variants
associated with revision surgery within 5 years of the initial THA/TKA, suggesting unique genetic variants that
may predispose some Veterans to poor adaptations to the initial THA/TKA. We will replicate significant findings
using data from 13,071 THA and 12,794 TKA in the UK Biobank. Exploratory Aim: To identify genetic variants
prognostic of THA/TKA recovery defined by mobility limitation (primary outcome), pain, and HRQL (secondary
outcomes). We will perform GWAS among the 7,600 MVP participants with past THA/TKA to identify variants
associated with recovery success or failure, as indicated by MVP Baseline and Lifestyle survey responses. As
a secondary analysis, we will investigate whether rehabilitation mediates the relationship between genetic
variants and THA/TKA recovery. We will maximize heterogeneity using two strategies: (i) By performing GWAS
in each major ethnic group independently and combining results using meta-analysis accounting for trans-
ethnic admixture; and (ii) By analyzing the entire MVP cohort to perform a multi-ethnic GWAS. The ultimate
goal is to identify genetic variants prognostic of OA as well as poor OA and THA/TKA outcomes to develop
targeted, precision pre-habilitation and post-surgical rehabilitation strategies improving mobility function,
HRQL, and healthcare utilization among Veterans.","Arthritis (i.e. osteoarthritis or OA) of the hip or knee is a major public health problem among our nationâ€™s
Veterans, and it often progresses to joint replacement surgery. VA healthcare costs for OA treatment exceed
$880 million annually. About 10,000 Veterans undergo hip or knee replacement each year, and many
experience deficits in health-related quality of life, severe functional limitations, increased healthcare utilization,
and higher incidence of other diseases and hospitalization. OA has a strong genetic component; however,
genetic predictors of disease progression and success of joint replacement recovery are not yet known. We
seek to leverage the Million Veterans Program to test the hypothesis that genetic variants explain a meaningful
proportion of OA prevalence, progression to joint replacement, and recovery success. Such discovery would
fuel progress toward precision pre-habilitation and post-surgical rehabilitation among Veterans.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,MARCAS M BAMMAN

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaring knowledge gaps in medical rehabilitation across the translational research spectrum demand rigorous, interdisciplinary clinical trials of th highest quality. We define these key gaps in three, equally important domains: (i) the fundamental underpinnings of both disease pathobiology and rehabilitation efficacy; (ii) optimal intervention strategies - in a disease-specific and population-specific manner - that maximize function and life quality; (iii) mechanisms to achieve the ultimate translation to clinical practic and user engagement. With particular emphasis on chronic conditions such as stroke, brain or spinal cord injury, orthopedic and joint conditions, and developmental and degenerative disorders leading to disability, the overarching purpose of the proposed P2C National Resource Center for High-Impact Clinical Trials in Medical Rehabilitation is to catalyze high-impact, interdisciplinary clinical trials nationally that will: (i) reveal fundamental underpinnings; (ii) efine optimal intervention strategies; and (iii) streamline translation to clinical and community-based application. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a leading-edge academic health center ideally positioned to achieve this stated purpose - with its unique depth and breadth of resources and collaborative expertise - complemented by a long-standing and extensive national network of partners to both support trials development and promote the Center's resources. The Center is carefully designed with an integrated research infrastructure - coordinating resources locally and nationally - that will significantly advance the field by encouraging medical rehabilitation researchers to take full advantage of specialized expertise and experience, an extensive menu of core resources and interdisciplinary research centers, and comprehensive study design and support services often not available through their local institutions or other organizations. This unique infrastructure will enable us to achieve the Center's purpose via the following specific aims: Aim 1. To advance the research of medical rehabilitation investigators nationally, we will provide effective consultative and/or educational services and collaborative arrangements that will facilitate all aspects of clinical trial design ad conduct, and competitive funding will be awarded nationally for innovative pilot projects needed to shape large-scale, definitive clinical trials (e.g., dosing trials, adaptive, delayed start, withdrawal and futility trials, and trials evaluating the interactions of complex mixtures of treatment modalities, etc.). Aim 2. To encourage medical rehabilitation researchers to take full advantage of the national resource Center's unique resources and expertise by effectively promoting and disseminating all of the Center's programs. Aim 3. To develop, validate, and provide state-of-the-art techniques and tools that will strengthen high-impact clinical trials nationally by enabling medical rehabilitation researchers to conduct more rigorous trials yielding higher quality data with potentially greater influence on clinical practice and health care deliver.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are major knowledge gaps in medical rehabilitation that demand clinical trials of the highest quality.

5T32HD071866-08,Interdisciplinary Training in Pathobiology and Rehabilitation Medicine,"The overarching goal of the mixed predoctoral and postdoctoral T32HD071866 training program is to develop
burgeoning scientists into future leaders in translational rehabilitation research â€“ scientists who are equipped to
test and disseminate novel rehabilitative strategies that will alleviate impairment and compromised life quality
in the face of chronic disease management. To meet this goal, we will build on achievements during the first
funding cycle, as the program grew in number of trainees and established a reputation that attracts high caliber
applicants nationwide. The now proven program leverages an exceptionally rich institutional environment that
offers myriad resources, and a collaborative team that has grown to 50 productive mentors in three categories
(Core, Content, Mentors-in-Training); all of whom are deeply committed to training and career development.
Trainees benefit from two years of interdisciplinary training that carefully meld three core levels of scientific
inquiry: (i) molecular pathobiology; (ii) rehabilitation science/physiology; and (iii) rehabilitation medicine (i.e.
clinical trials). Consequent to recent successes in faculty recruitment â€“ seeding more interdisciplinary teams â€“
translational rehabilitation research training in the renewal period will expand to four areas of concentrated
strength: (i) Musculoskeletal Disorders; (ii) Neurologic Diseases; (iii) Cardiometabolic Diseases; or (iv) Cancer.
Predoctoral trainees are selected from a highly competitive and diverse national pool admitted to a UAB
graduate program (e.g., Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Rehabilitation Science). Nationally recruited
postdoctoral trainees leverage institutionally funded training/career development programs tailored to meet
diverse postdoctoral training goals. Each trainee's primary mentor and Translational Mentoring Team are
drawn from expert program faculty in the Schools of Medicine (cell/integrative biology; physical medicine &
rehabilitation; neurology; pathology; medicine; surgery; oncology; pediatrics; biomedical engineering), Health
Professions (rehabilitation & nutrition sciences), Public Health (biostatistics; epidemiology), and Arts &
Sciences (psychology). Together the trainee, mentor, and Translational Mentoring Team craft an individual
development plan, approved and monitored semi-annually by the Executive Committee. The plan includes
coursework, laboratory and clinical research, professional development programs, workshops, presentations
locally and at national meetings, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Learning to conduct and
publish high-impact research is a primary focus. The program will continue mentoring 4 predoctoral and 4
postdoctoral trainees each year, and will leverage expanded resources to maximize recruitment and training of
underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities. As a top 25 NIH-funded academic medical center
with over 80 state-of-the-art scientific core facilities and 24 University-wide, interdisciplinary research centers,
the University of Alabama at Birmingham is remarkably well-positioned to cultivate truly translational scientists
equipped to drive the field of rehabilitation medicine with cutting edge research.","The main goal of this training program is to develop highly competitive junior scientists into future leaders in
rehabilitation research. This goal will be met by taking advantage of a rich academic environment that offers
numerous resources and a complementary and collaborative team of basic and clinical research mentors

characterize the range of molecular transducers (the `molecular map') that underlie the effects of physical
activity (PA) in humans. We formed an interdisciplinary team with the requisite experiences to contribute
significantly to the overall success of MoTrPAC. Our Exercise and Physical Activity Collaborative Team
(ExPACT) â€“ an alliance of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for Exercise Medicine (UAB),
Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes in Orlando, Florida (TRI-MD), and Ball State
University Human Performance Laboratory (BSU) â€“ has extensive experience performing highly-controlled
aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) exercise training clinical trials in healthy and diseased populations. We have
a lengthy history of maximizing human biospecimens (muscle, adipose, blood) to reveal molecular
underpinnings linked to physiological and clinical outcomes of acute and chronic exercise stimuli. Moreover,
the overarching goal of ExPACT is to contribute substantively to successful MoTrPAC planning, execution,
and innovation. Phase I (Planning Year) Aim 1. We will effectively collaborate with MoTrPAC leaders and NIH
leadership to help guide and finalize the structure and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Aim 2.
Leveraging institutional resources committed to ExPACT and our previous experience, we propose to collect
pilot biospecimens to facilitate the MoTrPAC Chemical Analysis Sites' ability to optimize analyses. Phase II
(Recruitment and Testing Years 2-5) Aim 1. We will enroll 420 sedentary but healthy men and women 18+ y
into a rigorously controlled, 12-wk, randomized trial of AT (n=185), RT (n=185), or no-exercise control (CON,
n=50). ExPACT geography will enrich MoTrPAC racial, ethnic, urban, suburban, and rural diversity. The design
incorporates comprehensive phenotyping to assess fitness and clinical outcomes, and human tissue
phenotyping to link the molecular transducers with key biological responses to exercise. Aim 2. Pre- and post-
training, we will obtain strategically timed biospecimens before and after acute exercise. To better understand
the biological extremes, we will conduct the same acute response studies in highly-trained athletes (AT (n=20)
or RT (n=20)). Serial biospecimen collection in CON will allow estimation of biological, seasonal, circadian and
methodological variability. Aim 3. To enhance the overall scientific impact of MoTrPAC, we will seek additional
funding to conduct innovative ancillary studies, which will markedly augment subject and tissue phenotyping
and interpretation of the molecular maps. Phase III (Close-out Year 6) Aim 1. We will complete all ExPACT
data entry, quality control, and central deposit procedures in collaboration with the MoTrPAC Coordinating
Center, and we will actively contribute to the completion of biospecimen analyses, manuscript writing, and
dissemination of results. We would be honored to collaborate with MoTrPAC to contribute future knowledge on
the molecular mechanisms through which physical activity can improve or preserve health.","While there are many important health benefits of physical activity and rigorous exercise training, the
underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms would substantially impact public health by provided new information that may be leveraged to

5R01HD084124-05,Overcoming TWEAK Signaling to Restore Muscle and Mobility after Joint Replacement,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While elective total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty relieve pain and improve mobility function for thousands with end-stage osteoarthritis (OA), up to 35% endure persistent muscle atrophy and mobility limitations for several years that impact life quality, increase morbidity, and burden the healthcare system. Given that THA/TKA volumes are increasing exponentially with >1.1 million in the US annually, refractory mobility impairment is a major public health problem. Together, the available data raise two important knowledge gaps in THA/TKA rehabilitation: (i) poorly understood factors that limit responsiveness of a large number of patients to current usual care; and (ii) the absence of rehabilitation programs proven to overcome these limitations. The proposed project is designed to fill these gaps. Our fundamental tenet is that restoration of mobility function following THA/TKA requires: (i) regeneration of surgically damaged muscle; and (ii) regrowth of muscles that have atrophied over years of OA and limited usage. We suggest a major cause of muscle regeneration impairment in some individuals is what we identified as muscle inflammation susceptibility (MuIS) - hyperactive inflammatory signaling in muscle of MuIS(+) individuals despite no systemic inflammation - which also manifests in isolated primary satellite cells and inhibits myogenesis in vitro, indicative of a true cellular phenotype beyond the niche. Our preliminary findings in THA/TKA patients strongly suggest the TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) signaling pathway may be central to MuIS and impaired THA/TKA recovery, as high perioperative muscle TWEAK signaling in the ipsilateral thigh was the most sensitive indicator of impaired muscle protein synthesis and failed strength recovery after 8 wk of usual care. Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) is a putative anabolic intervention that we find consistently increases muscle mass to meet healthy standards in atrophied and mobility-impaired adults, by activating muscle protein synthesis and the myogenic activity of muscle satellite cells. Together, these findings raise the central hypothesis that PRT plus adjunctive functional mobility training (PRT+FM) after THA/TKA will more effectively restore muscle mass and mobility function to healthy standards than usual care and, because MuIS(+) are predicted to suffer failed muscle recovery and persistent dismobility under usual care, the impact of PRT+FM will be greatest in MuIS(+). We will thoroughly test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial of 88 THA/TKA patients with the following aims. Aim 1: To determine the effects of 16 wk of PRT+FM vs. usual care after elective THA/TKA on muscle mass, performance, and mobility function. Aim 2: To determine whether MuIS status modifies the effects of PRT+FM or usual care after THA/TKA. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of muscle mass regulation will be studied in detail. Aim 3. To determine the long-term impact of 16 wk PRT+FM by re-assessing outcomes at 6 mo and 1 y. We fully expect the novel findings to lead a paradigm shift in THA/TKA rehabilitation that will have a profound impact on a growing segment of the population.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  While hip and knee replacement surgeries relieve pain and improve function for most, as many as 35% suffer from muscle loss and mobility limitations for several years after surgery that impact life quality and strain healthcare. The important purpose of this study is to test a rehabilitation strategy involving progressive strength training and mobility training that is expected to restore function and quality of life.

1R21CA216789-01A1,Cervical cancer derived xenografts (PDX) and organoid raft cultures to evaluate pathway specific therapeutic agents.,"Project Summary/abstract: HPV associated cancers have increased significantly (>16%) in USA, as per the
latest data. Resistance to the current chemotherapy leads to a high recurrence rate and patient death. This
resistance has largely been attributed to inter-and intra- tumor heterogeneity. The identification of new
therapeutic agents is urgently needed. The hallmark of HPV cancer is a highly expressed E6/E7 genes of high-
risk HPV types. Their expression is necessary for the survival of cervical cancer cell lines. These viral oncogenes
are known to dysregulate host DNA damage responses, apoptosis, metabolism, mitotic checkpoint, and immune
responses. We propose that inhibitors intervening one or more of these targets in combination with current
chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin, would increase efficacy and reduce morbidity and mortality. NCI encourages
drug testing in patient derived cervical tumor xenografts (PDXs) in mice, rather than cancer cell lines. The
establishment and inhibitor screening in these model is time consuming, labor intensive and costly, limiting the
scope of testing the candidate inhibitors or their combination to predict patient-specific treatment. We have
established a novel method to culture cervical cancer as organoid raft cultures as an in vitro tumor model. The
organoids can be used to initiate PDX in SCID mice. Conversely, PDX can be grown as organoids. Here, we
propose to combine the PDX model with the ease and economy of organoid raft cultures for initial evaluation of
new candidate inhibitors. In the first Aim, we propose to validate similarities in phenotypic, genetic, and molecular
characteristics among organoids, organoid-derived and patient-derived PDXs in SCID mice and the founder
tumors. Significant and precious time and costs will be saved in preclinical investigation of new therapeutic
strategies, if the organoid raft culture displays high similarity to the PDX and parental tumors. The HPV E6/E7
oncoproteins dysregulate the cell cycle regulation, the DNA damage and Spindle assembly pathways and
metabolism, basis for viral carcinogenesis. The second aim is to evaluate a panel of 6 inhibitors against novel
protein targets (Hec1, KIF-11, Aurora A, TTK, HSP90B1, and O-GlcNac Transferase) in the above named
pathways. Our preliminary study showed that each was critically required for the survival of cervical cancer cell
lines in submerged cultures or HPV transformed cells in vivo. We will also test Vorinostat, a pan HDAC inhibitor,
which we found to be promising in our preliminary study. These inhibitors alone or in combination with cisplatin,
which is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent to treat cervical cancer, will be evaluated in vitro in
organoid raft cultures of PDX derived from four independent cervical cancers and in corresponding PDXs in vivo
for comparison. The results are expected to validate organoid raft culture as an economical and expedient
method of drug evaluation prior to validating in vivo. Additionally we will establish new cc PDXs for future
evaluation of agents. These studies will reveal whether the incorporation of these new pathway-specific inhibitors
increased the efficacy of current chemotherapy and are candidates for further preclinical investigation.","Project Narrative:
Human papillomaviruses are prevalent pathogens, and persistent infection by the high-risk HPV
genotypes can lead to cervical cancer, a singular cause of death of over one-half million women
worldwide every year, while chemo-resistant recurrent cervical cancer kills about 4000 women
annually in the US. To augment available chemotherapies, the proposed research aims to identify
and validate inhibitors that target HPV-modulated host cell pathways in preclinical models based
on patient derived primary cervical cancers grown in immuno-deficient mice and as three-
dimensional organoid cultures in vitro. The goal is to develop effective new combination therapies
with diminished morbidity, reduced investigational costs, and accelerated discovery time line.",2019,193793,130500,63293,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections,Nilam Sanjib Banerjee
5R00HL131866-05,Metabolic drivers and sensors of cell proliferation in pulmonary hypertension,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Title: Metabolic drivers and sensors of cell proliferation in pulmonary hypertension Key Words: Pulmonary hypertension, glucose metabolism, O-GlcNAc, cell proliferation K99 pathway to R00 independence: The applicant took a unique opportunity to join the Cleveland Clinic Pathobiology Department for his postdoctoral training to gain experience in human translational research. The K99 application will combine his pre-doc expertise in basic research and his post-doc translational/clinical research to create an independent, translational career. By the end of the 2
year K99 portion of the award, he will have established an animal model for pulmonary hypertension, acquired the necessary skills to interrogate this model for the 3-year R00 transition, and link this it to his continued study of human clinical research.  Research Plan: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive disease that leads to deterioration in cardiopulmonary function and premature death. Presently, IPAH is considered a vasculopathy, and metabolic dysregulation, including dysregulated glucose metabolism, has emerged as a major area of research in the pathobiology of the disease. Several processes may be governed by the metabolic dysfunction present in IPAH, including enhanced pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, and vasoconstriction. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective therapies that target the underlying disease processes in IPAH. We recently published that increased O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) activity was shown to enhance pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation and worsen IPAH disease outcomes. OGT is a molecular stress `sensor' and is responsible for the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins that are involved in cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, and
nutrient metabolism. Proper homeostasis of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is required for cell viability and regulation. When elevated and sustained, the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is a `driver' of disease pathology through the marked regulation of fundamental processes, including cell proliferation and nutrient metabolism. On the other hand, instant and temporary homeostatic changes within the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis can protect cells from the onset of oxidative stress, hypoxia, trauma hemorrhage, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HBP flux and the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis is fundamental to protect the lung vasculature in the early progression of IPAH, while excessive and sustained levels lead to the `end-stage' of the disease. Using a combination of models ranging from human cell culture to animal models, we will test our hypothesis by investigating the following specific aims: AIM 1 (K99; human clinical training and transition): Determine the mechanism(s) whereby the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis regulates glucose utilization and metabolism in IPAH. AIM 2 (K99, R00): Investigate the specific molecular regulator(s) of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the pathogenesis of IPAH and a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. AIM 3 (R00, independence): Determine the role of the increased OGT/O-GlcNAc axis in the early progression of PAH using a hypoxia/sugen mouse model. The proposed K99/R00 application is innovative because it: (i) utilizes didactic training leveraged through the interaction between the Programs of Excellence in Glycoscience (PEG) sites (Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins University) as well as other significant sites (New York University and University of Illinois-Chicago); (ii) evokes translational research from both human IPAH samples and hypoxia/sugen mouse models to determine the molecular regulators that contribute to the imbalance of the OGT/O-GlcNAc axis and its impact on aberrant glucose metabolism and cell proliferation in IPAH; and (iii) launches long-term, core collaborations between the PI, established scientists in the field of glycobiology, and clinicians/scientists in pulmonary vascular disease. The project will identify the sensors and drivers of the glucose metabolism and cell proliferation, improve our understating of IPAH pathogenesis and progression, and offer new insights into the pathobiology of IPAH to ultimately improve patient functional capacity, quality of life, and long-term survival.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

NORC community, but also from investigators in the many schools throughout UABâ€™s campus who may bring
new ideas and eventually become NORC members. Selection of projects to be funded by NORC is a two-step
process. In the first step, the opportunity for funding is advertised using all possible mechanisms (on the NORC
website; flyers throughout campus; in the UAB eReporter (an electronic newspaper distributed to the entire
campus community); and email dissemination through Deans, Chairs, and Directors of University-wide
Research Centers, including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS; i.e., UABâ€™s CTSA)).

nutrition- and obesity-related research are also eligible to apply. Submitted abstracts (1 page or 500 words) are
reviewed by the P&F Program directors and the NORC senior leadership to identify which are most meritorious
and which would utilize NORC Cores. Those who have submitted the top-rated abstracts are then invited to
submit a full application. Once received, these applications are reviewed and scored extramurally (using the
NIH review scoring scheme) by experts in the field. The scores and the written reviews are then considered by
the P&F Program directors and the senior NORC leadership. P&F Program awardees not only receive funding,

5R01AR067925-05,Melanocortin signaling: genetic insight from X-linked color mutations in non-model organisms,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positional cloning of mouse coat color mutations has provided a foundation for identifying and understanding paracrine signaling pathways that play fundamental roles in biology and disease. The phenomenon known as pigment-type switching-whereby hair follicle melanocytes switch between the production of red/yellow pheomelanin vs. black/brown eumelanin-has been especially informative for pathways used by the neuroendocrine, adrenal, exocrine, and pigmentary systems because of the central role played by the Melanocortin 1 receptor. Large-scale efforts in chemical mutagenesis and reverse genetics are gradually saturating the potential of the laboratory mouse as a tool for gene discovery, but advances in genomic technology have extended the reach of forward genetics beyond traditional model organisms. Although the pathways are evolutionarily conserved, the sensitivity of color variation as a phenotypic readout coupled with the opportunity to observe and select for unusual mutations in companion and domestic animals provides additional opportunities. The current proposal focuses on two ""classical"" coat color mutations in non-model organisms, Orange in the domestic cat and Sex-linked yellow (Sly) in the Syrian hamster; these are especially interesting because they are X-linked, yet mimic a loss-of-function mutation in the autosomal Melanocortin 1 Receptor (Mc1r). Our preliminary studies have identified a candidate mutation and mechanism for Orange, and a genetic map position and positional cloning strategy for Sly. Additional knowledge about the genetics and biology of melanocortin signaling will come from: (1) Experimental genetic studies in cultured cells and in transgenic animals to experimentally confirm and explore the molecular pathophysiology of Orange; and (2) Molecular identification and characterization of the hamster Sly mutation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improvements in human health depend on understanding the signals that cells use to communicate with one another in the context of an entire individual; these signals are frequently disturbed in human diseases.

For the past two decades, the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham

and addressing racial and geographic disparities in cancer outreach, screening and prevention. Core to this
work was the success of our academic-community partnership born out of recognition of extraordinarily high
cancer mortality in select counties in Alabama (AL) and Mississippi (MS). The partnership, known as the Deep
South Network for Cancer Control (DSN) was one of the first community-based participatory research (CBPR)
initiatives funded by NCI. While our prior outreach and population science infrastructure has been utilized to
successfully reduce some risks of cancer, this revision of our core cancer support grant will provide an
opportunity to form new scientific collaborations and partnerships and expand our evidence-based community
health advisor (CHA) outreach and prevention model gardening intervention into additional communities in our
catchment area (AL) and communities in one of our impact areas (MS). Finally, we will better equip community
members and advocates with tools and resources to educate other community members and decision makers
on policies and programs relevant to the reduction of chronic disease burden in the Deep South. We expect
the enhancement to our Cancer Control and Population Science (CCPS) program will lead to a larger and
broader coalition of partners, staff, trainees and community members to facilitate our overall goal of reducing
cancer burden and eliminating health disparities by translating our observational and interventional research to
the community at large.","PROJECT NARRATIVE-ENRICHMENT PROGRAM

5R01HL133066-03,Circulating microparticle effects on phenotypically distinct pulmonary endothelium,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary artery and capillary endothelial cells are structurally and functionally heterogeneous in multiple
ways including their inflammatory response. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), CD68-positive
monocytes accumulate around arterioles as opposed to migrating into the alveolar space as they do in acute
lung injury. Further, inflammatory infiltrates are a feature of late-stage disease, are localized to small arterioles,
and are not as observable in the early stages of PAH. The contributions of the inflammatory cell infiltrates
include release of growth factors and further inflammatory stimuli. The precise mechanisms that influence the
temporal recruitment of inflammatory cells to the perivascular space in select size vessels and the influence of
the phenotypically distinct endothelium remain unknown. Microparticle signaling within phenotypically distinct
endothelium has not been considered and could have significant implications toward adhesion molecule
expression. We found that microparticles from late-stage PAH rats were endocytosed and localized to the
perinuclear space in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), induced adhesion molecule expression, and
promoted leukocyte adhesion. However, none of these events occurred in pulmonary microvascular
endothelium (PMVECs) with the same treatment. Further, microparticles isolated from the circulation of early-
stage PAH rats had none of these effects on either cell type. To determine the mechanism of microparticle
signaling in the PAECs we examined Rab proteins responsible for vesicle trafficking and intracellular
localization. RNAseq analysis and RT-PCR of PAECs and PMVECs revealed Rab36 is expressed only in the
PAECs. Rab36 is a newly identified RabGTPase responsible for retrograde transport of vesicles to the Golgi
and nucleus. Based on these data this proposal tests the overall HYPOTHESIS that late-stage
microparticles, circulating in PAH, increase adhesion molecule expression selectively in the
pulmonary arteries dependent on Rab36. SPECIFIC AIMS test the hypotheses that circulating
microparticles obtained from late-stage, but not early-stage PAH: 1. Stimulate expression and activity of
adhesion molecules selectively in the pulmonary artery. 2. Are dependent on Rab36 for uptake and
subcellular localization in the pulmonary artery.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive and fatal disease. Our goal is to understand the molecular
mechanisms governing circulating microparticle signaling to the pulmonary endothelium that induce
inflammatory cell recruitment and damage to the vessels. Understanding these interactions will lead to
development of novel therapies to halt the progression or stimulate the regression of vascular damage in
pulmonary arterial hypertension.",2019,378750,250000,128750,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,366880002,Clinical Research; Lung; Rare Diseases,Natalie Norwood Bauer

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PREVeNT Trial is a phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with vigabatrin in infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). The primary objective of the study is the developmental impact of early versus delayed treatment with vigabatrin at 24 months of age based on the cognitive assessment score of the Bayley-III. The secondary study objectives will focus on the effectiveness of early versus delayed treatment with vigabatrin in clinical seizure prevention and the prevalence of drug resistant epilepsy by the age of 24 months. Also, the impact of early versus delayed vigabatrin treatment on receptive communication, expressive communication, fine and gross motor skills, and risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The outcome measures for this secondary objective will be subdomain scores of the Bayley-III, Vineland-II, Beery Visual Motor Integration (VMI), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II) and ADOS2 at 24 months. Additional exploratory analysis will be completed at 36 months to access changes observed at 24 months are consistent with those seen at 36 months and indicative of long-term outcome. In addition, analysis will be done to determine the safety of vigabatrin as a preventative treatment for seizures in this TSC study population. The study will also confirm the feasibility of using EEG biomarkers to identify TSC infants at risk for developing epilepsy. The early diagnosis of TSC is possible because of the advances in technology such as prenatal ultrasound and often the diagnosis is now made prenatally or in early infancy before the onset of epilepsy due to non- neurological findings [Datta et al. 2008]. As a result there is an appropriate
window of opportunity to identify at- risk patients and initiate potential antiepileptogenic treatment prior to the onset of clinical seizures and subsequent epilepsy. The prevalence of medically-refractory epilepsy and associated intellectual impairment, autism spectrum disorders, and mental health disabilities in this population is well documented, [Chu-Shore et al 2010], justifying the initiation of therapy with potential side effects in a presymptomatic stage in TSC patients. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that early identification of EEG biomarkers and presymptomatic treatment with vigabatrin in infants with TSC can prevent or lower the risk of developing infantile spasms and/or refractory seizures. This preventative approach would promote more favorable cognitive, behavioral, developmental, and psychiatric outcomes.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study focuses on the developmental impact of early vigabatrin treatment in infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex who are at risk of developing epilepsy.

5P30DK072482-13,Core B - Animal and Preclinical Models Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: P30 CORE B
Animal models have become an increasingly valuable tool for biomedical research. Animal models are
particularly relevant to the understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF), where they are used extensively to
characterize CFTR expression and function and investigate the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. Furthermore,
animal models are critical to evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapies. The purpose of Core B is to
support the research of numerous P30 investigators that involves animal models, and the innovative assays
available to characterize them.
Core B carries out three main functions as outlined in the Specific Aims. First, Core B breeds, genotypes, and
distributes diverse CF relevant animal models. It provides CF models of mouse, rat, ferret and pig to dozens of
local, national, and international P30 investigators. Second, the Core aids in the generation and procurement
of relevant animal models required by P30 investigators. The Core helps generate new animal models using
cutting edge recombinant technology, including the novel rat model centered at UAB and more recently
humanized versions of this species (designated a National Core Resource). In addition, the Core acquires
available animals needed by P30 investigators, such as the CF ferret and pig models. In this way, the Core
helps investigators develop and characterize innovative animal models that can be used to expand the current
body of CF research. Third, Core B has developed numerous endpoint measures to assess CFTR function,
epithelial physiology, preclinical endpoints, and biospecimen analysis in CF animal models. The endpoint
assays conducted by the core include: extensive CFTR physiological outcome measures; assays of epithelial
function; state-of-the-art imaging modalities of the GI and respiratory tract (including ultrasound, micro-CT, and
micro-optical coherence tomography (a second National Resource, see Core A); physiological assays such as
Flexivent lung function, plethysmography, and cough monitoring; survival bronchoscopy; and techniques for
drug delivery and monitoring. These cutting-edge endpoint analyses supported by Core B help to uncover
disease mechanisms and pathways, and to elucidate clinically relevant findings.
Core B provides significant resources and technical expertise that greatly augment the efforts of P30
investigators. The efforts put forth by Core B also foster the sharing of ideas and promote collaboration among
investigators. Furthermore, the Core contributes to significant cost savings by providing animal models,
electrophysiologic equipment, expensive imaging modalities, small animal bronchoscopy and tissue/specimen
processing, and resources that are shared among many investigators without the need to duplicate the same
capabilities in multiple laboratories. In these ways, P30 Core B is indispensable for the research priorities
delineated by the overall UAB P30, including studies of CFTR cellular biology, tissue pathogenesis, and clinical
translation.",,2019,319643,215248,104395,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases,David M.

5P30DK074038-15,The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Cellular Physiology Resource: Core C,"ABSTRACT:
Hepato/renal fibrocystic disease (HRFD) is caused by mutations in genes whose protein products are
associated with cilia. Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(PKD) and mutations in PKHD1 cause autosomal recessive PKD. There are also a number of rare forms of
HRFD, which may provide valuable insights into common/unique mechanisms for cystic development. Recent
work has focused on understanding the cell signaling pathways that lead to HRFD. Although a number of
candidate signaling pathways have been identified, the signaling events that lead to initiation and progression
of HRFD have not been elucidated. There is currently no approved treatment for HRFD. The UAB P30 Center
will provide the Investigator Base with state-of-the-art HRFD models from Core B which are informed by
human HRFD mutational analysis from Core A. Core C will provided integrated physiology-proteomics-
genomics characterization of HRFD models and Core D will provide evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of
candidate drugs. Core C provides comprehensive services that are not typically available to HRFD
investigators at their home institution. The over arching premise of Core C is that to understand HRFD and to
test therapeutic compounds requires the ability to assess physiological readouts in both in vivo and in vitro
systems. Cell signaling and drug efficacy will be tested in accelerated models of HRFD, which will include
reduced renal mass hypertrophic signaling, toxins, and ischemia reperfusion. The First Aim is to characterize
mouse models of HRFD in vivo. This will include measurements of ambulatory blood pressure, GFR, cystic
progression, and renal damage/disease progression. Studies will be performed using multiphoton confocal
imaging, using recently developed cilia tagged or biosensor (GCaMP Ca2+) mice. The Second Aim is to
establish mTERT and hTERT immortalized cell lines from human HRFD patients and mice generated by
Core B. This will involve early passage Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) immortalization of cells to
maintain cell physiology states. For human cell lines, genetic analysis will be performed to identify the specific

9R01CA225177-04A1,Glycosylation-dependent mechanisms regulating ovarian tumor cell phenotype,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Aberrant surface glycosylation is a well-known tumor biomarker, however the functional role of the tumor
glycome in regulating tumor cell phenotype remains poorly-understood. Î±2-6 sialic acid (a bulky, negatively-
charged sugar) is a prominent tumor-associated glycan elaborated by the ST6Gal-I glycosyltransferase.
Research from our group has shown that ST6Gal-I sialylates select membrane receptors, including TNFR1,
which in turn causes activation of NF-ÎºB. ST6Gal-I is pervasively upregulated in ovarian cancer (OC), and
high expression levels correlate with poor patient survival and metastasis. Furthermore, forced ST6Gal-I
overexpression in multiple animal models fosters tumor initiation and progression. The central hypothesis of
the current proposal is that ST6Gal-I activity contributes to OC development by promoting NF-kB-dependent
signaling events that confer cancer stem cell (CSC)-like features to tumor cells. The NF-kB axis is one of
the most hyperactivated pathways in CSCs, and is a well-accepted driver of the CSC phenotype. The
concept that NFkB signaling and CSC behavior are regulated by tumor cell sialylation advances a new
paradigm in cancer cell biology. The proposed research has two principal objectives. The first (Aim 1) is to
establish that the master stem cell transcription factor, Sox2, is a key inducer of ST6Gal-I upregulation in
OC. Our preliminary data show that Sox2 binds directly to the ST6Gal-I promoter to stimulate transcription.
Downstream of ST6Gal-I upregulation, we postulate that ST6Gal-I-mediated receptor sialylation directs
CSC reprogramming via NFkB, consequently facilitating tumor initiation. The second major goal of the
proposal (Aim 2) is to define ST6Gal-Iâ€™s role in OC peritoneal dissemination, which is one of the chief
contributors to patient mortality. Unlike most solid tumors, OC primarily disseminates via fluid flow
throughout the peritoneal cavity rather than transit through the vasculature or lymphatics. The peritoneum
has very low oxygen tension, and therefore OC cell adaptation to hypoxia is an essential element in OC
progression. Recent studies from our group have shown that ST6Gal-I activity facilitates protection against
hypoxia by potentiating HIF1Î± signaling. Aim 2 will test that premise that ST6Gal-I-mediated hypoxia
adaptation is critical for OC cell survival and expansion within the peritoneal tumor microenvironment.
Collectively, the proposed studies are expected to uncover a highly novel glycosylation-dependent
mechanism that plays seminal roles in both early and late stages of OC development and progression.","Project Narrative
Decades of research have yielded only minor gains in the survival of patients with ovarian cancer,
highlighting the need for alternative approaches. The proposed research will focus on the role of a unique
glycosyltransferase, ST6Gal-I, in conferring stemlike characteristics to ovarian cancer cells, enabling tumor
cell survival and metastatic seeding of the peritoneal wall. This research will elucidate a novel mechanism
underlying ovarian cancer metastasis, thus opening up potential new avenues for treatment.",2019,317419,213750,103669,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; Ovarian Cancer; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human,Susan L Bellis
5U01CA233581-02,Sialylation-dependent mechanisms driving pancreatic cancer progression,"Summary
Although it has been known for decades that the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase is upregulated in cancer, there is
still a striking dearth of information regarding the functional role of ST6Gal-I in regulating tumor cell behavior.
Our group has been at the forefront of characterizing the specific ST6Gal-I receptor substrates that reprogram
tumor cell signaling to impart a stem-like, metastatic phenotype. These studies implicate ST6Gal-I as a master
regulatory molecule that controls the function (via sialylation) of key receptors including TNFR1, Fas, EGFR
and Î²1 integrin. Together this receptor cohort directs the activation of signaling cascades that promote
hallmark cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics such as invasiveness and apoptosis-resistance. In recent
unpublished work, we have definitively confirmed a tumor-driver role for ST6Gal-I in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We generated a new genetically engineered mouse with ST6Gal-I overexpression in
the pancreas, and crossed this line to the â€œKCâ€ pancreatic cancer model, which harbors oncogenic K-ras
expression in the pancreas. Compared to KC mice, KC mice with ST6Gal-I overexpression have greatly
accelerated PDAC development, metastasis, and mortality. We hypothesize that ST6Gal-I activity contributes
to two critical steps in pathogenesis: (1) acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), an early event in PDAC initiation
(Aim 1), and (2) PDAC metastasis (Aim 2), which is the chief cause of patient mortality. In Aim 1 we will
elucidate molecular mechanisms by which ST6Gal-I promotes ADM, focusing on the hypothesis that ST6Gal-I
activates NF-Ä¸B signaling to induce Sox9 expression. A robust literature has established that upregulation of
Sox9 plays an essential role in ADM, however the finding that ST6Gal-I-mediated sialylation controls Sox9
expression points to a transformative role for tumor glycosylation in PDAC initiation. The importance of a
ST6Gal-I/NF-Ä¸B/Sox9 signaling axis in ADM will be evaluated in: (i) the canonical 266-6 ADM cell model; (ii)
epithelial organoid lines derived from our various mouse models; and (iii) the in vivo ADM models, ductal
ligation and cerulein injection. In Aim 2 we will interrogate the sialylation-dependent signaling mechanisms that
reprogram tumor cells into CSC-like cells with metastatic capability. Our central premise is that ST6Gal-I-
mediated sialylation of EGFR, TNFR1/Fas, and Î²1 integrin acts as a molecular switch to alter signaling nodes
that confer stem-like properties. Furthermore, we will test the game-changing hypothesis that exosomal
transfer of active ST6Gal-I to recipient cells can reprogram these cells to acquire metastatic properties. To
verify that ST6Gal-I plays a causal role in metastasis we will use bioluminescence imaging to track the
metastatic dissemination of orthotopically implanted PDAC patient organoids, as well as Suit2 cells and their
isogenic metastatic clones. In the aggregate, these studies are expected to reveal an unprecedented role for
tumor cell sialylation in driving PDAC progression.","Project Narrative
 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a particular lethal form of cancer, which has prompted intensive efforts to
better understand the molecular biology of this disease, and uncover novel molecular vulnerabilities that can
be targeted for therapy. This proposal centers on the under-investigated role of tumor glycans, such as sialic

5R01CA194414-04,The Role of CK2 in Glioblastoma Development,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most deadly brain tumor, with median survival of 12-15 months. Aberrant activation of JAK/STAT, NF-ÎºB and PI3K/AKT pathways promotes GBM progression. CK2 is a serine/threonine kinase composed of two catalytic subunits (Î± and/or Î±') and two regulatory Î² subunits. CK2 regulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and signaling. CK2 interacts with JAK1/JAK2, thus intensifying JAK/STAT-3 signaling, and is intertwined in other pathways (NF-ÎºB and PI3K/AKT). CSNK2A1, the gene encoding CK2Î±, is amplified in human GBM (33.7%), while CSNK2B, the gene encoding CK2Î², is deleted in 14.1% of GBM. Amplification of CK2Î± and/or deletion of CK2Î² lead to heightened CK2 kinase activity. We propose that aberrant CK2 activity contributes to hyper-activation of the JAK/STAT-3, NF-ÎºB and PI3K/AKT pathways in GBM, leading to tumor survival and therapeutic resistance. We demonstrate that CX-4945, a selective CK2 inhibitor, suppresses JAK/STAT-3, NF-ÎºB and PI3K/AKT signaling in GBM xenografts, decreases GBM viability and significantly increases survival time in intracranial GBM xenograft models. Furthermore, the self-renewal properties of brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) rely on CK2 kinase activity. We hypothesize that targeting the aberrant kinase activity of CK2 will be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of GBM patients. Aim 1 will Determine Whether CK2 Inhibition has Efficacy Against GBMs and BTIC to Decrease Growth and Therapeutic Resistance In Vitro. Using our panel of molecularly characterized xenografts, we will assess if sensitivity to CX-4945 correlates with molecular subtype, CK2Î± amplification, CK2Î² deletion, or a combination thereof. The effect of CX-4945 on signaling pathways, gene expression profiles, functional parameters, and sensitization to temozolomide (TMZ), Î³-irradiation or gefitinib will be
examined. Genetic approaches to CK2 modulation will also be tested. Aim 2 will Determine Whether CK2 Inhibition, Alone and in Combination with Chemo- and Radiotherapy, Suppresses GBM Growth and Tumorigenic Potential In Vivo. Human GBM xenografts will be tested in orthotopic intracranial GBM models, and changes in survival rates, angiogenesis and myeloid cell tumor infiltration in mice treated with CX-4945 examined. The influence of inhibiting CK2 on TMZ, radiation and gefitinib efficacy in vivo will also be determined. Aim 3 will Evaluate Whether Unbalanced CK2 Subunit Expression Promotes GBM Growth in an Immunocompetent In Vivo Mouse Model. Genetically modified murine GL261 glioma lines that over-express CK2Î± or are deleted for CK2Î² will be tested in a syngeneic orthotopic model of glioma. Tumor growth and survival, as well as functional consequences including CK2 target activity, angiogenesis, proliferation, and immune cell infiltration and function (macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, T-cells) will be evaluated. Lastly, we will evaluate the therapeutic benefit of CX-4945, and determine how CK2 inhibition affects tumor cells as well as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our results indicate that CX-4945, the first selective orally bioavailable CK2 inhibitor, has a therapeutic benefit of inhibiting CK2 activity in intracranial models of GBM-patient derived cells in vivo. CX-4945 has demonstrated favorable safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamics responses in Phase I and II clinical trials; thus, targeting CK2 can have potential clinical utility in the devastating disease of GBM.",2019,326174,221887,104287,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Genetics; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,Etty N Benveniste
5P50NS108675-02,Project 2: Validating the JAK/STAT Pathway as a Novel Therapeutic Strategy in PD,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
Neuroinflammation is a major pathogenic factor in Parkinson Disease (PD). Both innate and adaptive immune
cells, including microglia, macrophages and CD4+ T-cells, are involved in PD. The JAK/STAT pathway is the
major signaling pathway used by cytokines, and is critical for regulation of immune responses. Our results
demonstrate that hyperactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway causes dysregulation of innate and adaptive
immune responses, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the AAV2-Î±-synuclein (syn)
model. Importantly, therapeutic treatment with a JAK1/2 inhibitor (Jakinib), AZD1480, prevented
neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative responses. Furthermore, we have preliminary data demonstrating
dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway in monocytes, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells from patients with PD
compared to controls, with observed sex differences. We hypothesize that in PD, abnormal forms of Î±-syn
cause altered activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to pathogenic innate and adaptive immune
responses. These events promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and suggest that
therapeutic intervention in the JAK/STAT pathway will alter the progression of human PD.
Project 2 of the Alabama Udall Center will examine how abnormalities in the JAK/STAT pathway in the context
of a new pre-clinical PD model (Aim 1) and in patients with PD (Aim 2) promote dysregulation of both innate
and adaptive immune cells, and how that impacts on the neuroinflammatory response and neurodegeneration.
We have demonstrated that use of a Jakinib with specificity for JAK1/2 (AZD1480) is protective in the AAV2-Î±-
syn PD model. Aim 1 will be the evaluation of targeting the JAK/STAT pathway in the new Î±-syn preformed
fibril (sPFF) model, that closely models human PD. We will test two novel Jakinibs which are both specific for
JAK1, with one being brain penetrant and the other not. These novel reagents will allow us to determine the
involvement of JAK1, JAK2 or both in PD pathogenesis, and test whether inhibiting signaling in the periphery is
sufficient for protective effects. In Aim 2, we will directly test our hypothesis that there is dysregulation of the
JAK/STAT pathway in human PD by examination of this pathway in myeloid cells, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-
cells from untreated, de novo PD patients. These studies will allow us to assess whether JAK/STAT pathway
dysfunction occurs at the earliest stages of PD, and if this predicts more rapid progression of clinical
symptoms, with a focus on cognitive symptoms. Collectively, the proposed studies will address an
unanswered question in PD: is activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the periphery and/or brain an
important contributor to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration?",,2019,379863,255800,124063,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Etty N Benveniste

2R01CA172447-06A1,Microenvironmental Regulation of Leukemia Stem Cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transformation by the BCR-
ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are highly effective in inducing remission and
prolonging survival in CML patients, but do not eliminate primitive, quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSC)
responsible for leukemia propagation and regeneration. As a result most patients experience rapid leukemia
relapse after TKI discontinuation. However, a subset of patients achieving prolonged, deep remission can
successfully discontinue TKI treatment without leukemia recurrence. Our research focuses on understanding
mechanisms of LSC resistance to TKI, and development of strategies to target LSC and their microenvironment
to prevent leukemia recurrence and enhance treatment free remission (TFR). We now understand that patients
achieving TFR continue to harbor small numbers of BCR-ABL+ LSC, suggesting that microenvironmental or
immune factor may regulate LSC potential to regenerate leukemia. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment,
which includes diverse hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, plays a critical role in HSC regulation. In
contrast, microenvironmental regulation of LSC growth is not well understood. Here we propose to characterize
critical niche regulatory mechanisms for maintenance of LSC, and that may contribute to leukemia recurrence
after stopping TKI treatment. We have shown that CML development leads to increased levels of several key
inflammatory cytokines in the BM, which can provide a selective growth advantage to CML LSC. Our preliminary
studies suggest that inflammatory signaling can modify CML BM MSC, resulting in enhanced support for CML
LSC, and reduced support of normal HSC. In Aim 1, we will explore the role of TNFa in mediating alterations in
BM MSC, resulting in increased expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL1 and enhanced signaling
through CXCR2 receptor, in LSC maintenance and leukemia regeneration after TKI treatment. Multipotent
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), identified on the basis of expression of LepR, nestin or Prx1, represent
specialized BM niches that maintain normal HSC. Our preliminary studies show that CXCL12 deletion from
Prx1+MSC leads to loss of LSC quiescence and enhanced sensitivity to TKI treatment. In Aim 2, we will
investigate mechanisms of regulation of LSC cycling and treatment resistance by CXCL12-expressing BM MSC
niches, focusing on regulation of EZH2 activity in LSC. We will also study the interaction between CXCL12 and
inflammatory signaling in modifying MSC niche function. These studies will be conducted using murine models
and primary human CML cells. Better understanding of mechanisms underlying microenvironmental regulation
of malignant stem cells will help guide development of novel strategies to enhance TFR in CML patients. We
further expect that the results of the proposed research will have broader implication towards other leukemias
and solid tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

leukemia stem cells that are sustained by the bone marrow microenvironment, and ultimately cause relapse.

5R35CA220502-02,Mitigating Long-term Treatment-related Morbidity in Childhood Cancer Survivors,"Cancer Relevance and Scientific Rationale: Childhood cancer survivors are at a life-long risk of chronic health
conditions; by age 50, the cumulative incidence of life-threatening/fatal chronic health conditions is 53%. The
two leading causes of premature mortality in childhood cancer survivors are radiation-related subsequent
neoplasms (SNs) and anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction (CD). Radiation and anthracyclines are both
used in >60% of children with cancer, and there are no plans in the foreseeable future to eliminate these agents.
Although there is a dose-response relation between radiation and SN and between anthracyclines and CD
(regardless of the underlying primary cancer), there is significant inter-patient variability in the risk, suggesting
the moderating role of genetic predisposition. The high burden of morbidity coupled with the inter-individual
variability in risk, suggests a need and an opportunity to identify patients at highest risk for treatment-related
morbidity, such that targeted interventions can be instituted. Broad Plan: This application harnesses and merges
novel concepts from the field of molecular biology, pharmacogenomics and cancer survivorship to identify cancer
patients by their personal risk of SN or CD. This award also attempts to understand the molecular pathogenesis
of these complications to inform future development of targeted prevention/therapeutic strategies. The necessary
infrastructure for the proposed research, including banked, annotated biospecimens (n=13,450) and pre-existing
collaborations with the necessary expertise will be leveraged in this application. The goals are to: i) develop a
risk prediction model for radiation-related SN and anthracycline-related CD in childhood cancer survivors; ii)
replicate the optimized model in an independent cohort of childhood cancer survivors; iii) apply the optimized
model to newly-diagnosed children with cancer to predict the risk of incident SN/CD; iv) determine the functional
relevance of the genetic signatures. Qualifications: I am the founding Director of the Institute for Cancer
Outcomes and Survivorship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I have over 20y of experience
conducting cancer outcomes research that bridges the fields of oncology, epidemiology and genetics. Since
2000, I have been charged with shaping the pediatric oncology survivorship research agenda within the
Children's Oncology Group â€“ an NCI-supported clinical trials group, devoted exclusively to pediatric cancer
research across 220 centers. I am currently serving as chair-elect for the ASCO survivorship committee. I am a
Leukemia Lymphoma Scholar, a recipient of the Frank H Oski award, and am an elected member of the American

Google Scholar H-INDEX is 66 (54 since 2012) and my i10-index is 182 (167 since 2012). I am fully committed

1U01CA213140-01A1,BMT Survivor Study-2 (BMTSS-2),"In 2017, an estimated 1.3 million individuals were living with a hematologic malignancy (HM: leukemia, myeloma
or lymphoma) in the US. Frontline use of systemic high-intensity chemotherapy with or without radiation
characterizes the management of HM. Patients with progressive disease or at high risk of relapse are treated
with even higher intensity chemotherapy/radiation and blood or marrow transplantation (BMT); indeed, BMT is
often the only curative option for these patients. Steady improvements in outcome have resulted in a growing
number of BMT-HM survivors â€“ a population that is uniquely vulnerable to long-term chronic health conditions
(CHCs) that are directly related to the high-intensity therapeutic exposures (e.g., subsequent neoplasms, heart
failure). In 2000, we constructed a retrospective cohort of 2,333 BMT recipients (City of Hope [COH] or University

mortality in BMT-HM patients, the modest sample size (n=2,333) and the older transplant era (1974-1998) has
limited the potential for new discoveries, especially in the face of evolving treatment strategies. We propose a
significant enhancement of the existing BMTSS cohort to now include 10,042 HM patients treated with BMT
between 1974 and 2014 at COH, UMN or UAB (BMT-HM), as well as a frequency-matched cohort of 3000 HM
patients treated with conventional therapy without BMT (non-BMT-HM). This enhanced infrastructure (BMTSS-
2) will be poised to determine the burden of morbidity borne by HM patients treated with or without BMT within
the context of individual HM diagnoses, and to understand the pathogenesis of treatment-related health
conditions in the setting of accelerated aging. The enhanced BMTSS-2 infrastructure will enable us to: i)
understand the long-term risk of health conditions experienced by HM patients treated with and without BMT; ii)
determine the association between treatment exposures and health conditions; iii) determine trends in health
conditions with changes in treatment strategies; iv) identify interactions between preventable modifiers
(comorbidities, health behaviors) and treatment exposures when determining risk of health conditions; v) study
the pathogenesis of treatment-related health conditions in the setting of accelerated aging, using genetic markers
for susceptibility and epigenetic markers for the association of the health conditions with aging; vi) use HIPAA-
compliant technology platform compatible with iOS/Android/iPad/Web-based applications to educate HM
patients and measure health behaviors in real time. This is the largest and most comprehensive attempt at
examining the health and wellbeing of HM patients treated with and without BMT. The overarching goal is to use
BMTSS-2 for translational research along two tracks: A) develop risk prediction models to identify HM recipients
at highest risk of treatment-related health conditions; and B) among those identified to be at highest risk, design
and test targeted interventions to prevent/ ameliorate these debilitating chronic health conditions.","Blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) is used with curative intent for life-threatening hematologic malignancies

1R01DK120684-01,The role of Tomosyn-2 in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions, with ~9.4% of the US adult population being diabetic,
and another 84.1 million have pre-diabetes. It is currently acknowledged that both insulin resistance and b-cell
dysfunction are early and essential events in the development of T2D. The formation of the SNARE (Soluble
NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) complex is rate limiting for insulin secretion. Our understanding of factors
that regulate the formation of the SNARE complex and how they contribute to reduced insulin secretion from b-
cells in impaired glucose tolerance is lacking. To this end, by using forward genetics approach, we have identified
Tomosyn-2, which is an endogenous inhibitor of insulin secretion and functions by binding to syntaxin. Syntaxin
is a key component of the SNARE complex that modulates the fusion of the insulin granules to the plasma
membrane for insulin secretion from b-cells. We have discovered that a gain-of-function mutation in the
Tomosyn-2 gene led to an increase in islet Tomosyn-2 protein abundance and formation of hypoinsulinemic/
hyperglycemic phenotypes in mice. Increased abundance and/or the functional activity of Tomosyn-2 causes
reduction in insulin secretion from human and mouse islets. Thus, the long-term goal is to understand how
Tomosyn-2 function in b-cells can be manipulated to improve insulin secretion in impaired glucose tolerance for
the treatment and prevention of prediabetes and T2D. The objective of this application is to determine how
Tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion from b-cells in the pathophysiology, physiology, and at the molecular level,
and how its inhibitory function in b-cells is regulated. Our data show that the improved glucose tolerance in
Tomosyn-2-null mice is a direct result of enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. Further, reduced
insulin secretion is observed in islets of mice on a high-fat diet that have elevated Tomosyn-2 protein levels. We
have identified phosphorylation sites in response to major b-cell signaling pathways that modulate Tomosyn-2
inhibitory function. Also, E3-ubiquitin ligase, Hrd1 and an insulin granule protein, Syt9 bind and regulate the
protein abundance of Tomosyn-2. Our hypothesis is that Tomosyn-2 is a key protein in the exocytotic machinery
that regulates SNARE complex-mediated insulin secretion in response to nutritional and genetic cues, and that
specific post-translational modifications of Tomosyn-2 increase insulin secretion. To test this hypothesis, we
propose three aims: 1) determine the sub-cellular mechanisms by which Tomosyn-2 inhibits insulin secretion, 2)
determine Tomosyn-2 phosphorylation regulates its activity on downstream insulin secretion, and 3) determine
the role of the Tomosyn-2-binding proteins, Syt9 and Hrd1, in regulating insulin secretion. Outcomes from this
project will provide novel information on how b-cells prevent inappropriate insulin secretion, identify the molecular
target for the early phase insulin secretion, and insights into the loss in fusion competency of insulin granules
during impaired glucose tolerance. Our results will provide fundamental new knowledge of the nutritional and
hormonal regulation of the SNARE complex, identifying steps that could be modulated therapeutically in T2D.","Project Narrative
Diabetes is a serious public health problem in the United States that affects more than 29 million people.

5K23HL133438-04,Diastolic Dysfunction and Pauci-inflammatory Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 Acute exacerbations account for the majority of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-
related morbidity, mortality and costs. Though many exacerbations are triggered by bacterial or viral infections
or exposure to airborne pollutants and result in marked lung inflammation, a significant number occur without a
clear precipitating cause and in the absence of pulmonary or systemic inflammation (pauci-inflammatory),
suggesting an alternative pathophysiology. This may in part explain why current therapies targeting lung
inflammation have only a modest effect on the rate of exacerbations and their outcomes even when used in
combination.
 We and others have shown significant interactions between the lung and the heart in COPD, with
accelerated atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, and a high frequency of diastolic dysfunction which may each cause
or contribute to the development of acute exacerbations. This may be particularly relevant for diastolic
dysfunction which may not only lead to overt pulmonary edema but can also cause subtle pulmonary
congestion leading to bronchial hyper-reactivity. The prevalence, risk factors, mechanisms and consequences
of diastolic dysfunction in this patient population remain unknown. We hypothesize that a subset of pauci-
inflammatory acute exacerbations are due to diastolic dysfunction resulting from cardiac ischemia, cardiac
arrhythmias and/or lung hyperinflation. These â€œcongestiveâ€ exacerbations have a different clinical and
inflammatory profile compared with episodes triggered by airway infection or exposure to pollution, and would
therefore be expected to respond to a very different treatment algorithm. It is further hypothesized that that
diastolic dysfunction in acute exacerbations is caused by subclinical coronary ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias,
and/or dynamic lung hyperinflation. We propose a prospective study to answer these high impact questions by
determining the frequency of diastolic dysfunction in acute pauci-inflammatory exacerbations of COPD, its
clinical implications and underlying mechanisms.
 We will prospectively enroll patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD and test our
hypothesis with the following three specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to assess whether diastolic
dysfunction is the primary cause of the pauci-inflammatory phenotype of exacerbations of COPD by evaluation
of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary and systemic inflammation during acute exacerbation, as well as in
stable phase after recovery. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate the clinical implications of diastolic dysfunction by
comparing the length of hospital stay, time to next exacerbation and overall frequency of exacerbations in
patients with and without diastolic dysfunction in the year following their index admission. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate potential mechanisms underlying diastolic dysfunction by assessing coronary ischemia and
surrogates for cardiac arrhythmias, as well as lung hyperinflation during the acute event and after recovery.
The results of our study will potentially identify a novel mechanism of exacerbations by defining a congestive
phenotype.
 I will utilize this proposal to acquire additional skills in advanced echocardiographic techniques to
further study the complex heart-lung interrelationships in COPD; gain a fundamental understanding of the most
up-to-date mass spectrometry techniques and their applications to proteomics of the lung in COPD; as well as
obtain a Masterâ€™s degree in Clinical and Translational Sciences to foster an independent career in translational
research and clinical trial design. The aims of this research proposal and career development plan are possible
through the active collaboration of Dr. Edwin Blalock, a leader in neutrophilic inflammation in COPD and Dr.
Mark Dransfield, a leading investigator in COPD with a special focus on exacerbations and cardiovascular
comorbidity. The opportunities created by this Career Development Award will provide me with a clearly
delineated path to acquire expertise and develop a research niche, compete successfully for independent
funding for translational and clinical research in the field of COPD and cardiovascular disease, especially as it
pertains to acute exacerbations. My ultimate goal is to identify novel etio-pathogenic mechanisms and new
therapies for acute exacerbations, with a special focus on the complex heart-lung interactions in this disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Acute exacerbations account for the majority of morbidity and mortality associated with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). A significant number of acute exacerbations occur without a known precipitating
cause and are associated with a distinct lack of pulmonary inflammation. Given the close interrelationship
between the lungs and the heart, some of these exacerbations may have a cardiac etiology, and exploring new
risk factors and pathways for acute exacerbations may lead to novel interventions for acute exacerbations of
COPD.",2019,194800,180741,14059,Other Research-Related,K23,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Infectious Diseases; Lung,Surya P.

1R21EB027891-01,Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration,
resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea,
is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the
small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without
COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory
morbidity.
Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in
approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea,
worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung
disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy
depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends
on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow
resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central
airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional
airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central
airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of
proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct
measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a
combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer
these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient-
specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography
(CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The
goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of
small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial
ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography.
The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights
gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit
from therapeutic interventions.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is
present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to
underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting
airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on
overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the
proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift

1R01MH116896-01A1,Excitatory and Metabotopic Regulation of PKA in Stress and Resilience,"STRIATAL EXCITATORY AND METABOTROPIC PKA REGULATION IN STRESS AND RESILIENCE
Mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are major health concerns that contribute
unabated to a large portion of all morbidity and mortality. These complex disorders may be viewed as mal-
adaptations that arise in brain circuitry. In order to achieve more effective treatments, better mechanistic
understanding of brain circuitry integration is needed. Normally, motivated behaviors and executive functions
require processing of sensory-triggered excitatory neurotransmission and assignment of emotional context. This
occurs in the striatum where cortical glutamatergic and midbrain dopaminergic inputs converge to mediate brain
functions such as reward and stress responses. Striatal dysfunction is broadly implicated in the etiology of many
mental illnesses. For example, stress-induced alterations in the activity of reward-related brain regions, such as
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), are linked to the pathophysiology of depression. Insight into the mechanisms by
which glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission are integrated within the NAc may shed light on some causes
of mental illness, or implicate new drug targets and treatment strategies. Here, we introduce a new signaling
mechanism which we hypothesize is controlled by striatal glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling to allow
concerted regulation of PKA activity. Specifically, our preliminary data indicates that glutamate controls
constitutive phosphorylation of the RII-beta (RIIb) regulatory subunit by Cdk5, which then directly affects PKA
activation by D1-type dopamine receptors via a second PKA-dependent auto-phosphorylation mechanism. We
hypothesize that this unique mechanism mediates striatal plasticity and behavioral responses to stress and that
chronic stress can cause mal-adaptations in this mechanism so that glutamate and dopamine signaling are
uncoupled and PKA signaling is dysregulated. We further hypothesize that this mechanism may be targeted to
improve striatal plasticity and behavioral resilience. To pursue this novel premise, we propose to 1) study the
regulation of RIIb/PKA and explore downstream effectors in vitro and in vivo; 2) study the role of RIIb/PKA
phosphorylation in ventral striatal neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity and 3) study the regulation of this
mechanism by acute and chronic stress, and determine how it contributes to behavioral responses to stress.
These studies will yield important information on the mechanisms that integrate brain circuitry and how they are
affected by stress. Thus, we will better understand some of the basis by which stress may contribute to complex
mental disorders such as anxiety and depression and how they may be more effectively treated.","Mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression extract enormous costs in the U.S., while available treatments
often address the symptoms rather that the molecular causes. Greater understanding of the neurobiological
basis of neuropsychiatric disorders is the first step toward more effective treatments. The goal of this research
is to understand a new fundamental mechanism by which the brain integrates environmental experiences with
emotional context, how this mechanism mediates synaptic plasticity and behavioral responses to stressful
conditions, how this mechanism may become dysregulated, and how it may be targeted to improve behavioral responses to stress.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Depression; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Mind and Body; Neurosciences,James A Bibb
5K08HL131867-03,The Mechanisms Underlying Abnormal Mucus and its Clearance in the Cystic Fibrosis Rat,"Project Summary / Abstract
Abnormal mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, especially in
the presence of infection; however, the mechanisms responsible for the defect are not well understood. Until
recently, evaluation of this question has been primarily limited to cell culture models which do not replicate the
complex nature of the airway surface or include contributions of the airway glands. Existing animal models of
CF either do not accurately replicate lung pathophysiology (CF mice) or are very difficult and expensive to
maintain for longitudinal studies to evaluate disease progress (CF ferret and pig). These challenges have left
the CF research field deficient of an accessible animal model that can be readily used to evaluate airway
physiology or response to pulmonary infection.
Recently, I helped characterize the first CF rat, developed at our institution, which recapitulates a number of
features highly relevant to human disease, due in part to expression of airway glands. This is a feature distinct
from murine CF models, and provides an animal well suited for longitudinal evaluation and experimental
manipulations. I have also recently established a method to chronically infect CF rats with mucoid
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To complement this, I have also advanced Micro-Optical Coherence Tomography
(ÂµOCT), a high-resolution reflectance imaging modality that can simultaneously and non-invasively evaluate
airway hydration, ciliary beating and mucus transport and viscosity in situ. Using these tools, this proposal will
investigate the following independent but complimentary aims:
1. Establish the mechanism underlying abnormal mucociliary clearance in the CF rat.
2. Determine the mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection
 in the CF rat.
3. Does correction of the CFTR defect ameliorate P. aeruginosa susceptibility.
This proposal will determine the early events that lead to infection and progression in CF pulmonary disease
and how this relates to the formation and expression of airway glands. The studies will provide new
fundamental observations that will inform our understanding of the CF respiratory pathology and help identify
robust therapeutic targets suitable for intervention. Combined with a unique training program focused on
optical imaging, mucus rheology, and microbiome analysis, this training period will position me for an
independent scientific career investigating disorders of mucociliary clearance using cutting edge techniques.","Project Narrative

5R21CA218973-02,Validation of a genomic signature that predicts for sub-optimal debulking of epithelial ovarian cancer,"Project Summary
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) affects approximally 21,000 women a year in the USA resulting in 13,000
deaths. Standard treatment includes debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. For 80% of
women this treatment is effective and prolongs survival. However, in 20% of women the cancer is extensively
disseminated through the peritoneum at time of surgery which complicates the surgical procedure and does
not allow optimal tumor debulking. For these women, tumor debulking is not effective and they experience
complicated and prolonged postoperative recovery.
A recent randomized phase III trial demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking
surgery is an effective alternative treatment for ovarian cancer patients and may be the ideal approach for
patients who cannot undergo optimal up front debulking. Thus there is a need to identify and stratify patients
based on their response to debulking surgery and develop more effective surgical and chemotherapeutic
approaches targeting sub-optimally debulked tumors
To address this need, we performed a meta-analysis of gene expression data using publicly available profiles
of 1,525 ovarian cancers and identified 198 genes that were highly expressed in tumors that were not optimally
debulked. We refer to these genes as â€œdebulking signature. Ontologic pathway analysis of the debulking
signature showed hyper-activation of a specific oncogenic signaling responsible for malignant cancer
behaviors such as dissemination resistance to chemotherapy, i.e. the TGF-ï¢ pathway. Thus, the signature may
serve as a predictive biomarker for patients who would benefit from up-front surgery and provide a biological
rationale for novel targeted therapies of tumors that cannot be optimally debulked.
The goal of this project is to develop a validated genomic signature which can be developed into
clinical diagnosis, and test in ovarian cancer mouse models whether targeting one of the most
enriched pathways of this signature, TGF-Î², is effective. We will validate the 198 genes identified as highly
expressed in EOC that are not optimally debulked using two independent tissue arrays and establish an
optimal genomic signature that can be used for pre-operative diagnosis of these tumors (aim 1). We will then
perform preclinical studies testing whether inhibitors of the TGF-ï¢ pathway currently being used in clinical trials
for other cancers, improve management of disseminated ovarian cancer models in mice (aim 2).
Altogether, we will establish a predictive biomarker that assists the surgeon and patient to choose the best
surgical procedure to be applied to an EOC patient, as well as identify a new adjuvant chemotherapeutic option
that improves therapeutic outcome. If successful, these studies will spare women from therapeutic suffering
and prolong their lives.","Project Narrative

4R00AA025401-03,"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Alcohol Cues, Cortisol Response and Compulsive Motivation","PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term career goal of the applicant is to develop an independent program of research on the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs), specifically those
related to binge drinking. Results from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health show that 26% of
adults in the US engaged in binge drinking in the past month (SAMSA 2014). Why some people â€œmature outâ€ of
this behavior while others persist may be due to oneâ€™s physiological response to binge drinking. No previous
study has assessed whether disrupted cortisol and neural network responses to alcohol cues may drive the
compulsive alcohol consumption seen in binge drinking individuals who do not yet have an AUD. Over the
course of the applicantâ€™s career, she hopes to contribute to our understanding of the genomic, neuroendocrine,
and neural mechanisms that underlie the development of AUDs.
 So far, she has received excellent training regarding the neurochemical and neuroanatomical
substrates (from genetics to functional networks) involved in the effects of acute alcohol on the brain and in the
chronic, relapsing course of severe AUDs. On this solid foundation of clinical and behavioral neuroscience, she
now aims to obtain further training within the highly productive and supportive infrastructure at Yale in (1)
advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques, (2) the clinical course of hazardous drinking prior to the onset
of AUDs, and (3) multilevel, mixed effects longitudinal analyses to launch a career as an independent
researcher in the field of interdisciplinary, translational neuroscience research on alcoholism. Without this
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, the applicant will not have the protected time, training, or the
resources to initiate this new direction of research. This rigorous K99 training program will help the applicant
obtain a new skill set required to develop a long-term program of research which incorporates multiple
interdisciplinary methods in the study of the development of AUDs. This training plan will be achieved via: 1)
structured mentoring programs 2) supervised research experience, 3) formal coursework and
seminars/workshops, and 4) attendance at national and international conference meetings.
 To further the applicantâ€™s training with an independent research project, during the R00 phase, the
applicant will recruit beer drinking, non-smoking men and women ages 21-45 (N=90, equal gender) who are
either moderate drinkers or binge/heavy drinkers for a single neuroimaging and neuroendocrine assessment to
determine if their real world drinking behavior in a prospective one month follow up can be predicted based
upon the cortisol and neural network responses to alcohol cues. Finally, the influence of genetic variation in the
FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, which regulates cortisol activity, on the cortisol and neural network

3R35HL135710-03S1,A Novel Exosomal Inflammatory Pathway,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This Program has defined what some have called a paradigm shifting pathway of neutrophilic inflammation
which, unlike the â€œclassicâ€ mode associated with IL-8, can become self-propagating in chronic inflammatory
diseases such as COPD. Specifically, IL-8 initiates neutrophil (PMN) influx, the PMNs in turn release matrix
metalloproteases (MMPs) and prolyl endopeptidase (PE) which degrade collagen and generate the PMN-specific
matrikine, proline-glycine-proline (PGP). In more common acute inflammatory circumstances, the PGP pathway
is terminated by the aminopeptidase activity of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) which destroys PGP. Cigarette
smoking (CS) can chemically modify and inactivate LTA4Hâ€™s aminopeptidase but not hydrolase activity as well
as acetylate PGP rendering it immune to LTA4H. This drives persistently elevated PGP levels and chronic
neutrophilic inflammation in COPD. In the Programâ€™s journey to understand the PGP system, we have identified
a novel potential prognostic biomarker for COPD, CF, and ARDS, linked matrix degradation to vascular leak,
and discovered an anti-inflammatory role for a pro-inflammatory enzyme, LTA4H. PGP has also recently been
shown to link extracellular matrix degradation to: acute lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic brain
stroke, and modulation of acute pulmonary infection. Consequently, the discovery of the PGP system has
particular significance as a fundamental mediator of pathophysiology in a number of disorders and organs. One
enigmatic aspect of our studies has been an inability to generate PGP in vitro with collagen and the appropriate
proteases in solution. The thesis of this R35 application is that this enigma is due to the requirement that PGP
generating enzymes, such as PE, be exosome associated. This idea is supported by many observations, most
notably, that airway exosomes from COPD patients, but not controls, are PMN-derived and cause a COPD-like
phenotype when transferred to mice. Collectively, the findings led to our hypothesis that proteolytic exosomes
constitute a new aspect of the inflammatory process and may participate in chronic inflammatory disorders such
as COPD via the PGP pathway. If successful, the results of this project will define a novel entity, i.e. proteolytic
exosome, which drives neutrophilic inflammation via PGP generation which is regulated by LTA4H and can
cause a COPD-like disease in mice. In human studies, we will phenotype proteolytic exosomes and delineate
whether they are biomarkers of COPD that correlate with disease parameters and can transfer pathology from
humans to mice. In a smoking mouse model of COPD we will characterize the evolution of such exosomes and
whether they can transfer disease from smoked to naÃ¯ve animals. Although, the definition of a new pathogenic
entity is daunting, the track record of this Program and the expertise of the PI and team suggest a successful
endeavor. If so, a complete understanding of the proteolytic exosome may lead to new diagnostics and

5R01MH116789-02,Reaching 90 90 90 in Adolescents in Zambia: Using all our SKILLZ,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Despite considerable progress, many countries are still struggling to achieve the
UNAIDS 90 90 90 targets. These targets have been particularly challenging amongst
adolescent girls, with poorer uptake, retention and viral suppression being reported3-6
Grassroot Soccer (GRS) and the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia
(CIDRZ) have collaborated to develop a comprehensive adolescent package that
providse sexual and reproductive health services (SRH), including HIV testing and
treatment, in adolescent friendly spaces. This program builds off a strong social support
with peer mentoring and the use of social networking and adolescent-friendly clinical
services that integrate HIV with sexual and reproductive health services (SRH). The
`SKILLZ programme' developed for adolescent girls by GRS generates demand for all
steps in the HIV cascade among young women. It is a sport-based school intervention,
to increase the use of HIV and SRH services and to improve psychosocial well-being,
including self-esteem, empowerment, and self-sufficiency. To ensure an uninterrupted
continuum of care, we have integrated SKILLZ with CIDRZ teen services to create
`SKILLZ Plus', a seamless 90-90-90 pathway for adolescents in Zambia. Instead of
focusing on changing young women's attitudes towards their own risk using a medical
model, we leverage the power of soccer, local peer mentors and female life coaches to
build bridges between young women and services often viewed as inaccessible, distant
or irrelevant.
Our Specific Aims are to 1.Examine the incremental cost effectiveness of SKILLZ
Girl on HIV testing among adolescent girls in secondary schools in Lusaka using a
quasi-experimental impact evaluation. 2. Assess the impact of SKILLZ Plus over
two years on viral load suppression (Aim 2a) at 6 months and retention at 6 months, 12
months and 24 months (Aim 2b) through an individual-level randomized controlled
trial for those who test positive and 3. Identify mediators, predictors and barriers to
uptake of SKILLZ Plus (testing, retention and viral load suppression) both quantitatively
through mediation and moderation analyses and qualitatively through focus groups
discussions (FGD) with coaches and girls.","Project Narrative

5R01CA183921-05,Targeting GLI-dependent Transcription by GANT61 in Colon Cancer,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The GLI genes, GLI1 and GLI2, encode transcription factors that regulate target genes at the distal end of the canonical Hedgehog signaling (HH) pathway (SHH->PTCH->SMO->GLI), tightly regulated in embryonic development, tissue patterning and differentiation, with low-level expression in adult tissues.  In cancers, both GLI1 and GLI2 are oncogenes, aberrantly and constitutively activated. Oncogene-driven signaling pathways, in particular KRAS/BRAF in colon cancer, circumvent the HH-GLI axis, channel through GLI, and induce further constitutive GLI activation, giving GLI a pivotal role in cell survival.  Using GANT61, a small molecule inhibitor    
of GLI-dependent  transcription, we have demonstrated that targeting GLI terminates oncogenic HH-GLI and KRAS/BRAF-GLI  signaling,  inducing extensive cell death in seven human colon carcinoma cell line models examined. We have demonstrated that: 1) GANT61 is specific for targeting GLI; 2) inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2 by GANT61 rapidly reduces binding to consensus sequences in target gene promoters and inhibits GLI-dependent transcription; 3) GANT61 induces GLI-dependent transcriptional stalling of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)  at sites of early elongation  with accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops); 4) consistent with transcriptional inhibition, GANT61  induces DNA damage (Î³H2AX foci) in S-phase and non-S-phase cells, recognized at the initiation of S-phase (G1/S), prior to the onset of cell death. The overall goal s to understand the mechanisms by which GANT61 inhibits GLI-dependent transcription that induces DNA damage leading to extensive cell death. In Specific Aim 1, we have identified stalling of Pol II adjacent to GLI binding regions at target gene promoters, associated with modification of promoter-bound pause (DSIF, NELF) or pause-release (P-TEFb) factors.  Single-stranded DNA (R-loops) and RNA: DNA hybrids are detected at sites of stalled Pol II; Î³H2AX foci are induced. The hypothesis is that GANT61-induced GLI-dependent stalling of Pol II creates ssDNA at sites of early elongation that generates DNA DSBs within R-loop regions.  In Specific Aim 2, we have demonstrated that DNA damage is recognized at the initiation of S-phase, inducing a transient    
intra-S-phase checkpoint prior to the onset of cell death.  The GLI1 target gene FOXM1, and its transcriptional target CDC6, that regulate the G1/S transition and initiation of DNA replication, are decreased in GANT61-treated cells. The hypothesis is that FOXM1 and CDC6 regulate Pre-Replication complex assembly at G1/S thereby inhibiting the initiation of DNA replication, which controls outcome of the GANT61 response, dependent on GLI.  In Specific Aim 3, we will target constitutive GLI activation in uniquely engineered in vivo models of human colon cancer xenografts and in a transgenic mouse GLI-luciferase reporter model.  GLI is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers.   Further, KRAS is mutated in 30% of all human cancers, and in 50% of colon carcinomas.  This proposal therefore has the potential for high impact, and is anticipated to lead to new approaches and therapeutic strategies for GLI as a target.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have demonstrated that the oncogenic GLI transcription factor, active at the distal end of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, is a nodal point of convergence for oncogenic signaling, and that the small molecule, GANT61, is a specific inhibitor of GLI-dependent transcription in colon cancer cells, inducing extensive cell death. Due to the importance of GLI as a target, we will determine the mechanisms by which GANT61-GLI binding inhibit GLI-dependent transcription involving stalled RNA polymerase II, formation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) and induction of DNA double strand breaks, that lead to cell death. Understanding these mechanisms of GLI regulation will offer new possibilities for strategic drug targeting of constitutive GLI activation, which occurs in a wide variety of human cancers, hence the proposed studies are of broad impact.",2019,532166,221887,310279,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,SOUTHERN RESEARCH INSTITUTE,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Research Institutes,352052708,Cancer; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics,Rebecca  Boohaker
1R13DC017912-01,International Congenital CMV Conference and CMV Workshop,"ABSTRACT
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of invasive CMV disease in immune compromised
individuals and a leading cause of congenital infection globally. Invasive CMV disease in patients with immune
compromise results in significant morbidity and mortality. Congenital CMV infection is the leading non-hereditary
hearing loss in children both in the U.S. and worldwide. It is estimated that between 3,000 and 6.000 children
born annually in the U.S. experience long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae from congenital CMV infection.
The 2019 CMV Conference (CMV2019) is the combined 7th biannual Congenital CMV Conference and the 17th
International CMV Workshop. This integrated meeting brings together researchers working on all aspects of
CMV disease, clinicians, public health policy experts and parents and advocates with a primary goal of reducing
the disease burden from CMV infections. The topics that will be selected include those at the forefront of CMV
research and the program is planned to disseminate new findings that can be translated to reduce or mitigate
the consequences of CMV infections in immune compromised individuals and infants with congenital CMV
infection. Topics will include (1) molecular mechanisms of CMV disease in various clinical settings, (2)
pathogenesis of mother-to-child transmission of CMV, (3) virus-host interactions (4) cutting-edge knowledge on
virus genetic diversity and its role in transmission and disease, and (5) effective intervention and prevention
strategies to reduce the disease burden from CMV infection. In addition to the unique collection of research
topics, this meeting provides a platform for new speakers, early stage investigators, and trainees. We will
designate a proportion of invited presentations and session chairs for trainees or new investigators. Also, at least
half of invited speakers and session chairs will be women. In addition to oral presentations, posters will be
displayed throughout the conference and the two poster sessions will be held at the end of the day with extended
periods of time for the presenters and attendees to interact and exchange ideas. By bringing the best of the CMV
research community together, the overall goal of this conference is to advance the field towards innovative
research and novel strategies for translating research findings to help alleviate the public health impact of CMV
disease in all patient populations.","Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a cause of significant disease burden in immune compromised individuals and
in congenitally infected children. The disease burden from congenital CMV infection equals or exceeds other
more commonly known conditions including Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome and therefore, a major
public health burden worldwide, because of its prevalence, economic costs, and the overall number of individuals
with permanent disabilities. Despite the importance of CMV infection to overall health, current understanding of
the disease mechanisms, available options for treatment/intervention, and prevention strategies are limited. By
highlighting emerging concepts, state-of-the-art knowledge, and addressing strategies to improve translation of
scientific findings to viable intervention strategies, the CMV2019 will promote advances that have a high chance
to improve health.",2019,29540,29540,,Other Research-Related,R13,National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Prevention,Suresh B Boppana; KAREN B FOWLER; SHANNON A ROSS
5F30AI140829-02,Impact of cross-reactive CD8 T cells on HIV-1 viral control and evolution,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this NIH F30 application is to obtain support for the PI, Sushma Boppana, for mentored research
and career development activities within her MD/PhD degree training that will strengthen her potential to become
a successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in immunology that will allow the PI to study
CD8 cross-reactivity in acute HIV-1 infection using cutting edge laboratory assays and computational techniques.
The primary objective of the research proposal is to investigate the impact of cross-reactive CD8 responses in
acute HIV-1 infection on viral control and evolution. CD8 T cells play a critical role in viral control during HIV-1
infection and are likely to be an important component of future effective cure therapies. However, the viral latent
reservoir represents a major obstacle to achieving functional or complete cure in HIV-1. This reservoir is now
known to encode significant numbers of escape mutations, and it is possible that CD8 T cells therapeutically
directed towards clearing HIV-1 in infected individuals will need to recognize multiple variants of the same
epitopes; in other words, they will need to be cross-reactive. This project seeks to quantify the amount of CD8
cross-reactivity seen in acute infection, to characterize the functionality of these responses, and to establish the
impact of these cross-reactive responses on viral control (Aim 1). This proposal will also determine the
contribution of individual TCR clonotypes to the overall cross-reactivity of the CD8 responses seen in Aim 1 and
will elucidate the impact of CD8 cross-reactivity on viral evolution by correlating cross-reactive responses to
diminished viral diversity (Aim 2). The long-term objective of our research is to better understand the role of
cross-reactive CD8 T cells in HIV-1 such that future cure strategies can more effectively manipulate the CD8
response to clear a variant-encoding latent reservoir.
The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her PhD mentor, Dr. Paul Goepfert. Included in the training
plan are experiences that will help the PI develop in three major areas: 1) rigorous immunological research in
HIV-1, including developing familiarity with the existing literature, critically evaluating published studies, and
training in principles of scientific integrity, responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility; 2)
competence in bioinformatic techniques and biostatistical analysis; and 3) career and professional development,
including grant writing, journal article review, clear communication through presentation and manuscript
preparation, and translation of research findings to clinical application. The overall goal of this training plan is to
provide the PI with a solid foundation for a successful career as a physician scientist, with the ultimate career
goal of leading a collaborative research team that bridges the gap between laboratory-based human immunology
research and the clinical prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

weaponized biological threats, the identification of new therapeutic targets, and the
development of drugs exploiting those targets, is essential. The Assay Core is a key component
of the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center (AD3C), contributing to the goals of
each of the individual Research Projects and to the Medicinal Chemistry Lead Development
Core (MCLDC). The overarching goal of the Assay Core is to assist the MCLDC to optimize
compounds into drugs by providing biological screening support. As part of the current AD3C
CETR program, the Assay Core (designated as the Screening Core in the current CETR
program), conducted seven HTS campaigns to identify compounds with antiviral activity against
each of seven emerging pathogen studied in this proposal. The compounds identified by HTS
for each virus have been developed into leads by the MCLDC. As a continuation of this effort in
the current CETR proposal, the Assay Core will provide the testing data needed to develop
structure activity relationships (SAR) for further optimization of these leads. Having an assay
core with at least medium-throughput capacity is essential to meet the goal to discover
compounds with the appropriate drug-like characteristics to enter animal studies. The resulting
data for each compound tested by the Assay Core will be maintained in a centralized database
with easy access by the members of the MCLDC and the Research Project teams. The Assay
Core will work with key members of the MCLDC and Research Project teams to make decisions
for compound progression. The end result of this process will be the identification of novel

5R01EY028861-02,A critical role for intracellular VEGF receptor translocation in ocular angiogenesis,"The collective evidence dictates that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family is
critical for ocular angiogenesis in conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and AMD.
Investigation of VEGF action has largely focused on receptor binding events and activation of
classical downstream signal transduction cascades. Work from us and others show that VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) signaling is much more complex and an alternative pathway involves
intracellular trafficking of VEGFRs (Fig 1). We have preliminary evidence that a) endosomal
sorting, neuropilin, secretases and sumoylation appear to be key regulators of VEGFR
trafficking, b) VEGFRs in the nucleus originate from an intracellular pool, c) translocation of
VEGFRs and the relative levels of VEGFRs within subcellular compartments dictates angiogenic
outcome and d) the VEGFR1:VEGFR2 ratio at adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions
(TJs) changes in response to pro- and antiangiogenic factors. Based on these observations we
propose the following paradigm shifting hypothesis: VEGF-driven vascular permeability and
neovascularization are highly dependent on the targeted subcellular translocation of
specific VEGFRs in endothelial cells and that the relative levels of VEGFRs within
subcellular compartments dictates vascular permeability and angiogenic outcome. We
further postulate that endothelial-specific manipulation of the VEGFR1:2 ratio through
gene therapy will reduce vascular permeability and inhibit aberrant retinal and choroidal
neovascularization. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims. In Aim 1, we
will a) To characterizing the origin and routes of VEGFR trafficking, b) identify the nuclear
targets of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and assess how these targets contribute to angiogenesis, c)
assess how the nuclear level of VEGFRs dictates the angiogenic outcome and d) identify the
mechanism by which secretases, and/or sumoylation regulate trafficking of VEGFRs. In Aim 2,
we will a) determine if translocation of VEGFRs to AJs and TJs is via membrane diffusion or
endosomal trafficking and b) assess how the ratio of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 at AJs and TJs
changes in response to pro- and antiangiogenic factors, the junctional binding partners involved,
and how this affects permeability. In Aim 3, we will assess the outcome of endothelial-specific
genetic manipulation of intracellular VEGFR levels on vascular permeability and retinal and
choroidal angiogenesis in mice. The proposed studies will significantly advance our mechanistic
understanding of aberrant ocular angiogenesis and will identify new potential therapeutic targets
for the inhibition of pathological ocular angiogenesis.","The collective evidence suggests that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family is
critical for neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy and AMD and this has become a major
target for therapeutic intervention. We have identified a novel non-canonical VEGF signalling
pathway that requires targeted subcellular translocation of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. We
believe that the ratio of VEGFR1:VEGFR2 within subcellular compartments dictates angiogenic
outcome and that a better understanding of these signalling pathways may help develop a
sustainable treatment strategy for pathological ocular angiogenesis which is a priority area for
the NEI.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative,Michael Edwin Boulton; Maria Bartolomeo Grant

phosphodiesterase isozyme, phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10), is overexpressed during early stages of
tumorigenesis; 2) genetic knockdown of PDE10 results in selective apoptosis of tumor cells by activating
cGMP/PKG signaling; and 3) small-molecule inhibitors of PDE10 induce apoptosis by PKG phosphorylation
of oncogenic Î²-catenin, thereby suppressing Tcf-mediated transcription of genes that encode for proteins,
such as survivin, essential for tumor cell survival. From a completed Phase I SBIR project involving a
medicinal chemistry and screening campaign with follow-up chemical optimization, ADT Pharmaceuticals
developed a novel PDE10 inhibitor, ADT-030, which concentrates in lungs following oral administration.

models of lung cancer, including a chemical-induced mouse model of cancer chemoprevention. Here we
propose studies to evaluate a clinically amenable oral formulation of ADT-030 that we hypothesize will be

There is also the explicit effort to incorporate young faculty to further strengthen the outstandin mentoring environment and to promote development of all phases of this program. An effective interdisciplinary training program requires faculty with collaborative and synergistic scientific interests and projects, as well as systematic coordination of training opportunities. The collaborative environment at UAB, embodied by the centers, programs, and departments in this application, provides a strong research foundation. The committed training environment of the thematically organized Graduate Biomedical Sciences program and an outstanding Office of Postdoctoral Education, provide an ideal setting for the implementation of training in interdisciplinary rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease research. Required coursework will be incorporated into the individual development plan (IDP) of each trainee, which will be augmented by a broad interdisciplinary enrichment program. Leadership will be provided by an Executive Committee and the overall performance of the Program will be evaluated by the Research Training Program Internal Advisory Committee and by an External Advisory Committee. To provide rigorous and timely feedback to both trainees and mentors, formal assessment of the Research Training Program will be performed. A series of benchmarks for progress will be formulated for each trainee and mentor and reviewed on a semi-annual basis. The members of the UAB training faculty are fully committed to continuing to provide mentorship, support, and guidance to young investigators to help them develop the tools and skills necessary to advance the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Training Program in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Disease Research at UAB enables vibrant, interdisciplinary, fundamental and translational research training.

1R56AI143994-01,"Molecular, Functional and Structural Analyses of Anti-PAD Antibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis","Project Summary
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory disease that results in joint swelling and pain,
radiographic damage, and disability. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are ~95% specific for RA.
Citrullination, a post-translational process of deimination of arginine residues, is catalyzed by peptidylarginine
deiminases (PADs) such as PAD4. A variety of proteins are citrullinated in RA, and PAD4 is thought to
contribute to RA pathogenesis by providing a continual source of citrullinated autoantigens that induce
autoimmune responses. Dr. Darrah and colleagues identified antibodies (Abs) to PAD4 itself, which are
associated with: (i) disease severity, (ii) serum ACPA, and (iii) severe erosive joint damage. They also
discovered a subset of anti-PAD4 Abs cross-reactive with PAD3. These unexpectedly cause increased PAD4
enzymatic activity and their presence in serum defines a subset of RA patients exhibiting the most erosive
damage. There are many unanswered questions regarding B cell/antibody immune responses to PAD4 and
PAD3 in RA. These questions will be addressed using a registry/repository of well-phenotyped RA patients
(mostly Caucasian) and access to a large database and repository of African-Americans with RA. Novel
cutting-edge techniques will be used to study B cell immune responses at the individual cell level, including
sequencing of paired heavy and light chain antibodies from serum and transcripts from circulating
plasmablasts/B cells. We will define molecular characteristics of anti-PAD Abs (specificity, epitope mapping,
etc.). In tandem with the functional studies above, structural studies will be used define the molecular
determinants of immune complexes comprising PAD4 antigen bound to anti-PAD4 or anti-PAD4/3 mAbs (Fab
variants). Thus, the cellular, molecular, biochemical, and structural mechanisms of antibody-mediated effects
on PAD4 will be elucidated. Our Specific Aims are: 1. To identify and quantify the molecular species of anti-
PAD IgG and IgA antibodies circulating in serum of RA patients and to identify the B-cell subset of origin. We
will characterize anti-PAD4 and PAD4/3 IgG and IgA antibody protein repertoires in RA patients and perform
Next-Gen sequencing of key B lineage subsets. This will allow us to identify, quantify, and rank by abundance
and subclass all Ig clonotypes in the anti-PAD repertoires. 2. To define the molecular correlates of anti-PAD
binding and modulation of PAD4 activity. a. We will define the molecular characteristics of monoclonal PAD
antibodies that are required for PAD4 binding, cross-reactivity with PAD3, and activation of PAD4 catalysis.
Using serum of RA patients, we will directly define the Ig class and subclass repertoire of polyclonal circulating
anti-PAD antibodies in RA serum and determine how these may correlate with clinical characteristics. 3. To
determine the structure of PAD-containing immune complexes and the mechanisms by which anti-PAD4/3
cross-reactive antibodies mediate PAD4 activation. Structural studies will define the molecular determinants of
immune complexes comprising PAD4 antigen bound to anti-PAD4 or anti-PAD4/3 mAbs (Fab variants).","Project Narrative
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common inflammatory arthritis that causes joint damage and disability. We will
use cutting-edge research approaches to perform detailed analyses of a unique set of antibodies (anti-PAD4
and anti-PAD4/3) that play an important role in joint damage in RA through promotion of a biological process
called protein citrullination. These patient-based analyses will contribute significantly to understanding the role
of B lymphocytes and antibodies in RA and may lead to better diagnosis, improved prediction of joint damage,
and novel treatment strategies in RA.",2019,392687,348139,44548,Non-SBIR/STTR,R56,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Arthritis; Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Rheumatoid Arthritis,S Louis Bridges; GREGORY C IPPOLITO
5R01AI118805-05,Vaccine potential of the proline-rich domain of pneumococcal surface protein A,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protection against otitis media, non-complicated pneumonia, and meningitis requires a vaccine solution that is not capsular type-specific. The pneumococcal surface protein PspA elicits protection in mice against pneumonia, bacteremia, colonization, and fatal sepsis. PspA was in FDA-approved safety (phase 1) trials (1998, 2002, 2010, and 2012-14). These trials revealed no safety problems, and the human antibody (Ab) elicited to PspA protected mice from fatal sepsis. The human trials of purified rPspA (1998, 2002, and 2010) examined protection elicited by the ~300 aa a-helical domain (aHD) at the N-terminal end of PspA. The aHD is variable; up to three different aHD may be required in a vaccine to cover the diversity of PspA in all Sp. We have recently shown that the ~80 aa proline-rich domain (PRD) also elicits protection against sepsis. The PRD domain is found in all PspAs. Each PRD contains 1 to 5 different 6-10 AA repeat sequences. We have protective  monoclonal antibody (mAb) to one of these short repeat sequences and to a conserved 22 aa non-proline block  (NBP) sequence, present in ~50% of PRD. However, a PRD lacking either of these epitopes could still elicit cross-protection, indicating the existence of additional protective epitopes. We have already found Ab to four of the PRD repeat sequences in human sera. We will create broadly cross-reactive rPRD by including all of its common protection-eliciting epitopes. Developing a highly cross-protective PRD immunogen is important because some of the delay in moving PspA into phase 3 efficacy trials is due to concern that variability in the aHD
structure may allow Sp to evolve around a PspA aHD vaccine. The PRD will provide a second set of epitopes with which to cover all PspAs. We will determine the degree to which rPRD can replace, or augment, the cross-protection elicited by the aHD against Sp strains of all relevant capsular types. Aim1. Identify major protection-eliciting repeats in PRD that are immunogenic in mice, rabbits, and humans and use this information to construct candidate rPRD expected to be broadly cross-protective. Aim2. Evaluate cross- protection elicited by the rPRD immunogens constructed in Aim 1 in mouse sepsis, focal pneumonia, and colonization models. Compare the ability of PRD, aHD, and PRD+aHD to elicit protection against diverse Sp.  Variations in PspA structure are not genetically or functionally related to capsule type. Thus, it has long been assumed that the protection observed against the few mouse-virulent capsule types with Ab to PspA would hold for Sp of non-mouse virulent capsular types. To examine protection against invasive strains of all relevant capsular types we will: 1) use our in vitro functional assay, 2) ue focal pneumonia which is caused in the mouse by many more capsular types than sepsis, and 3) use host inflammation-associated molecules to temporarily enhance the virulence of invasive clinical IPD isolates of capsular types that are not normally mouse-virulent. Aim3. Determine whether Ab to PRD can enhance C' deposition on Sp and enhance the killing of Sp by bactericidal peptides. Ab to the aHD of PspA functions by both of these mechanisms.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pneumococcal disease causes at least 2 million deaths annually (~10,000 in the US), primarily in infants and the elderly, and costs over 7 billion dollar annually in the US (1); modern vaccines against capsular polysaccharides are costly, incomplete, and need improvement. Protection-eliciting pneumococcal proteins, such as PspA, could provide a viable alternative/adjunct vaccine. This project will characterize protection-eliciting epitopes of the largely un-studied proline- rich domain of PspA to improve strain coverage of PspA immunogens.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Hematology; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Sepsis; Vaccine Related,David E Briles
5F30CA232397-02,Role of Oncometabolite L-2 Hydroxyglutarate in Reprogramming Renal Cell Carcinoma Metabolism,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the ten most common neoplasias for both men and women in the
United States. Tragically, 25% to 30% of RCC patients present with metastatic disease, with 5-year survival
rate of only 5%. There are currently very few therapeutic options for locally advanced or metastatic RCC.
Metabolite studies by our lab identified high levels of the putative oncometabolite L-2 Hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG)
in kidney cancer. Build up of L-2HG in RCC is due to reduced expression of the enzyme L-2HG
dehydrogenase (L2HGDH). L2HGDH frequently undergoes copy loss in RCC. This enzyme normally
functions to revert L-2HG back into alpha-ketoglutarate (Î±KG), a Kreb cycle intermediate. Our lab has
demonstrated that restoration of L2HGDH in renal cancer cells suppresses tumor phenotypes.
Oncometabolites, metabolites that build up in cancer cells, such as L-2HG, can affect gene transcription by
competitively inhibiting Î±KG-dependent enzymes that modify DNA and histone methylation. Due to their high
abundance in cancer cells, oncometabolites present a viable option for the development of personalized
treatment strategies in RCC as well as other cancer types. Preliminary studies from our laboratory
demonstrate that L-2HG can suppress the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and that
this loss alters nutrient requirements in high L-2HG RCC cells. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that loss of these enzymes demonstrates a targetable metabolic liability in RCC. In aim 1, we will
dissect the molecular underpinnings by which L-2HG can suppress amino acid biosynthesis. In aim 2, we will
assess the potential to target these findings therapeutically. Through our studies, we hope to identify novel,
metabolism-based approaches for patients with cancers that are oncometabolite driven.","Build-up of oncometabolite L-2-Hydroxyglutarate in Renal Cell Carcinoma leads to epigenetic metabolic

5R01AI089956-07,Congenital CMV and CNS Infection Mechanisms of Protective Immunity,"Project Summary/Abstract
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) represents the most common viral infection
acquired by the developing fetus. Although most infants infected in-utero do not suffer
long term symptoms, approximately 10% can have long term sequelae. Central nervous
system (CNS) damage is the singular cause of these long term sequelae. Prevention of
CNS infection and disease is the target of current antiviral treatment and has been
proposed as a goal of prophylactic vaccines. The pathogenesis of CNS disease in
congenitally infected human infants remains undefined and to date studies in animal
models of CNS infection by HCMV have provided little information secondary to
significant limitations inherent in these models. We have recently developed a murine
model of infection of the developing CNS with the related murine CMV that recapitulates
many key characteristics of the human disease, including hearing loss that is common in
infants with congenital CMV infections. Using this model we propose to define
mechanisms of protective antibodies that limit CNS infection and disease. In addition, we
will explore the use of engineered viruses that are attenuated in their capacity to cause
CNS disease and establish persistent infection to induce protective antibody responses.
We anticipate that these studies will identify strategies for development of targeted
biologics such as antibodies and attenuated viruses that can provide immunologically
mediated protection from CNS infection and damage that can follow congenital HCMV
infection. Because of the relatedness between MCMV and HCMV, these strategies could
be rapidly transitioned into development of similar biologics for human use.","Project Narrative

5R01DC015980-03,Inflammation and Hearing Loss Following Congenital CMV Infection,"Abstract:
Hearing loss associated with congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, a relatively
frequent perinatal infection, accounts for nearly 25% of all causes of hearing loss in infants and
children in the US. The mechanisms of disease caused by infection of the inner ear by this
large herpesvirus are unknown, primarily because of hurdles inherent in the investigation of the
inner ear in humans. We have developed an informative murine model of hearing loss in which
newborn mice are infected peripherally and not intracranially with the closely related murine
CMV. In this model, about 30-50% of infected mice develop sensorineural hearing loss and a
significant number of mice with hearing loss exhibit progression in hearing loss, a clinically
important feature of hearing loss in infants with HCMV associated hearing loss. Our findings
strongly argue that virus-induced inflammation and not direct viral cytopathology is responsible
for hearing loss and progressive hearing loss in this model. Our studies will explore this
hypothesis by defining mechanisms of damage to the developing auditory system and hearing
loss in animals associated with CMV-induced inflammation of the inner ear. Results from these
studies will guide investigation into mechanisms of hearing loss in infants and children with
HCMV associated hearing loss and identify therapeutic approaches that can be translated into
treatment and prevention of hearing loss in CMV infected infants.","Project Narrative:

that virus-induced inflammation and not direct damage to the inner ear by the virus infection is responsible for

2R01HD061959-13A1,CMV Vaccines: Reinfection and Antigenic Variation,"Abstract:
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common viral infection acquired in-utero and
a significant cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in infants and children. Although the development of
prophylactic vaccines to prevent or modify this intrauterine infection is a high priority, the unique epidemiology
of cCMV infections, particularly in highly seroimmune maternal populations presents a potential hurdle for
vaccines that will induce immunity similar to that following natural infection. Paradoxically, the rates of cCMV
infections are highest in maternal populations with the highest rates of seroimmunity. In addition, the incidence
of clinically apparent congenital infections and long term neurodevelopmental sequelae in these populations
are similar to those in populations with lower rates of maternal seroimmunity. In this application we will explore
the hypothesis that reinfections with new strains of CMV contributes significantly to the incidence of non-
primary maternal infections that result in cCMV infection and that the source of new strains of CMV are
household exposures, specifically young children. Our approach will be to identify sources of virus exposures,
introduce a cognitive-behavioral intervention to reduce the risks of these exposures, and to determine the
impact of this intervention on the prevalence of cCMV infections in a population of pregnant women with near
universal seroimmunity to CMV prior to conception.","Project Narrative:

5R01AI120619-04,HCMV miRNA Regulation of Secretion and Formation of the Viral Assembly Compartment,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of primary cells results in massive alterations in normal cellular metabolism and regulation of cellular pathways that govern cell death, nucleic acid replication, cellular membrane homeostasis, cytoskeleton integrity, and intracellular trafficking of proteins. Numerous studies have documented the widespread dysregulation of cellular gene transcription following HCMV infection arguing that major changes in cellular phenotypes are controlled at a transcriptional level. However, crude regulation of essential and highly coordinated cellular functions such as protein transport and membrane homeostasis could result in a cellular environment that would also limit the production of infectious virus. Our recent studies have demonstrated that HCMV miRNAs regulate the secretory/endocytic pathway during infection by targeting genes encoding-key components of these pathways, thus providing another layer of HCMV regulation of cellular functions. Regulation of these pathways by HCMV miRNA results in inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the reorganization of intracellular membranes to facilitate efficient production of infectious virus. In this project, the specific genes in the secretory/endocytic pathway targeted by HCMV miRNAs will be identified by a comprehensive approach combining PAR-CLIP methodology with informatics followed by rigorous validation. Initially, the role of validated miRNA targets in the regulation of trafficking in the endocytic an secretory pathways will be defined, followed by investigation of the role of these miRNA targets in cytokine trafficking and secretion, membrane reorganization, and infectious virus assembly. Validation of the role of these cellular targets of HCMV miRNAs in regulation of the secretory/endocytic pathways of the infected cells and their phenotypic effects on cytokine secretion and virus assembly will be accomplished by engineering recombinant HCMVs expressing specific combinations of shRNAs targeting genes within these pathways. It is anticipated that these studies will elucidate the role of these regulatory RNAs in the outcome of HCMV infection of the cell as well as defining a new and novel mode of regulation of essential cellular pathways leading to a cellular environment optimized for assembly of infectious virions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Micro RNA (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate a number of cellular processes.

5I01RX001995-04,Impact of a Hospital Mobility Program on Function after Discharge,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
There is strong evidence that disability among older adults is largely driven by illnesses and injuries that lead to hospitalizations. Data shows the likelihood of developing new or worsening disability, as well as a reduced likelihood of recovery from disability, is greatly increased with hospitalization. Our work has shown low mobility to be associated with adverse outcomes including decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), nursing home placement and death, even after controlling for illness severity and comorbidity. Intervention studies examining the effect o increasing mobility during hospitalization are sparse and typically measure in-hospital outcomes such as length of stay. However in our VA-funded study, we showed patients who received an in-hospital mobility intervention that included twice daily assistance with walking and a behavioral strategy that addressed barriers to mobility, setting of mobility goals, and encouraged patients to walk, had a clinically significant higher level of community mobility at one month post-discharge compared to usual care. This preliminary work was restricted to only one month of follow-up of veterans who were â‰¥ 65 years of age. A number of important gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of a hospital mobility program: 1) hospital mobility program studies have not used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the impact; 2) the actual number of steps and time spent walking by participants has not been measured; 3) outcomes beyond 30 days post-discharge have not been examined; and 4) characteristics of patients most likely to benefit from this type of intervention has not been identified. For this high impact stud we propose to use a stepped wedge cluster randomization design on five VA hospital wards to compare a mobility program (MP) to usual care (UC) among a cohort of veterans age â‰¥ 50 years. We will examine mobility and adverse outcomes including functional decline, nursing home admission, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization and death in the MP and UC groups in the year after hospital discharge using in-hospital and post-hospital assessments. Our overarching hypothesis is that a hospital mobility program that provides assistance with ambulation during hospitalization will reduce the observed loss of mobility and adverse outcomes associated with hospitalization and this difference between MP and UC will be maintained throughout the year follow-up period. The major aims of this research project are to test the effectiveness of a mobility program on recovery to pre-hospital mobility status or better and reduction of adverse outcomes including functional decline, ED visits, hospitalization, nursing home admission and death in the year after hospitalization; and to identify characteristics that modify the effect of the mobility intervention on recovery to pre-hospital mobility status or better and reduction of adverse outcomes in the year after hospitalization. A successful mobility intervention that prevents loss of mobility or quickens recovery to pre-hospital levels could significantly impact quality of life and reduce disability for thousands of hospitalized patients. This line of research has the potential to change the standard of hospital care provided to all patients.   
   
","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   
After hospitalization, many older adults experience more difficulty getting around in the community and performing one or more of their basic activities of daily living (ADLs) like bathing or dressing. The goals of this study are to test the effectiveness of a mobility intervention, compared to usual care, on change in mobility after hospitalization, to determine the impact on one-year outcomes such as nursing home placement and to identify which Veterans benefit the most from the intervention. Ultimately, our goal is to improve recovery after hospitalization and reduce disability in hospitalized Veterans.

ABSTRACT
The overall scientific goal of the CCPS Program is to reduce the burden of cancer through hypothesis-driven
observational (epidemiological) and interventional translational research that spans the laboratory bench to the
bedside and ultimately, the community at large (i.e., â€œbench to trenchâ€). This goal guides the research of 41
highly productive scientists who are members of this Program â€“ research that is supported by over $15 million
in grant funding. Given UAB CCC's location in the Deep South, a region marked by poverty and large
constituencies of underserved African-Americans and Appalachian Whites, an overarching theme of our
program is to eliminate health disparities across the cancer continuum, from primary cancer risk to improved
cancer survivorship. Additionally, since Alabama is a state with one of the highest rates of obesity, and that
many of the most prevalent cancers within our catchment area are associated with overweight and obesity, we
have worked diligently to develop a research focus in energy balance and cancer. The CCPS program is
comprised of a cadre of multidisciplinary investigators who hold faculty appointments in 14 departments and 6
schools and who have broad expertise in areas of molecular and genetic epidemiology, health and cancer
outcomes, cancer health disparities, behavioral science, nutrition and obesity, quality of life and end-of-life

ABSTRACT
The overall scientific goal of the CCPS Program is to reduce the burden of cancer through hypothesis-driven
observational (epidemiological) and interventional translational research that spans the laboratory bench to the
bedside and ultimately, the community at large (i.e., â€œbench to trenchâ€). This goal guides the research of 41
highly productive scientists who are members of this Program â€“ research that is supported by over $15 million
in grant funding. Given UAB CCC's location in the Deep South, a region marked by poverty and large
constituencies of underserved African-Americans and Appalachian Whites, an overarching theme of our
program is to eliminate health disparities across the cancer continuum, from primary cancer risk to improved
cancer survivorship. Additionally, since Alabama is a state with one of the highest rates of obesity, and that
many of the most prevalent cancers within our catchment area are associated with overweight and obesity, we
have worked diligently to develop a research focus in energy balance and cancer. The CCPS program is
comprised of a cadre of multidisciplinary investigators who hold faculty appointments in 14 departments and 6
schools and who have broad expertise in areas of molecular and genetic epidemiology, health and cancer
outcomes, cancer health disparities, behavioral science, nutrition and obesity, quality of life and end-of-life
care, and cancer survivorship research. Long-term partnerships with Historically Black Colleges/Universities in
our region, i.e., Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University provide a collaborative academic
network that stretches across the Deep South and has resulted in research and training opportunities that are
independently funded and have yielded publications in top-tier journals. The CCPS Program provides an
organizational infrastructure that facilitates training for new and junior members, and active forums for
collaborative interaction among all of its members. The CCPS also creates an active interface that enhances

5R01AR073850-02,Characterization of the lupus nephritis microRNAome,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this investigation is to identify and characterize the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum exosomes on
the risk of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and among patients with SLE, the risk of, and rate of progression
to, lupus nephritis (LN). SLE is a prototypic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the presence of antinuclear
autoantibodies, complement activation and multisystem organ damage, including LN, which accounts for
significant morbidity and mortality particularly among persons of African American and Amerindian ancestry. The
basis for this disparity remains poorly understood. Although the etiology of SLE is unclear, combinations of genetic
and environmental factors play a causal role. Despite the discovery of several SLE susceptibility loci, variation in
DNA sequence alone accounts for only a small fraction of common complex disease and efforts to utilize these
markers to classify or monitor SLE clinical course, and the development of LN, have not yet been successful. Recent
advances in transcriptome sequencing offer new opportunities to characterize miRNAs as novel biomarkers, which
could significantly change the paradigm of SLE clinical monitoring. We will test the overarching hypothesis that
distinct serum exosome miRNAs will correlate with the presence of SLE and among patients with SLE, the presence
of and time to, LN, and that miRNAs influence the severity and rate of progression of LN by altering target gene
expression. We intend to capitalize on a unique opportunity to explore these relationships in a large, ancestry
diverse, well-characterized population of established SLE while taking advantage of recent advances in
bioinformatics and whole transcriptome sequencing. Our objective to characterize the influence of exosome
miRNAs relative to the risk of SLE and among these patients, the risk and tempo of LN in paired blood and target
tissue fills a critical gap in knowledge required to advance efforts to detect, prevent and manage LN among SLE
patients, as well as to identify new therapeutic targets. Findings forthcoming from this investigation will fill a
critical gap elated to the disparate trends of SLE etiology and progression, which differ by ancestry, and may
translate to other kidney phenotypes including those observed in immune-mediated cancers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The purpose of this study is to identify serum exosome microRNAs associated with the risk of lupus and among
these patients, the risk and rate of progression of lupus-associated nephritis, and to characterize the role of
miRNAs in regulating gene transcription (mRNA). These relationships are important to provide insight into novel
biomarkers, which can be used to predict, classify and ultimately treat lupus and lupus-associated nephritis, which
disproportionately affects women and ethnic minority patients. The knowledge gained from this study may help us
to lower the risk of lupus and lupus-related clinical manifestations and to manage and treat it more effectively.",2019,660896,492762,168134,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Kidney Disease; Lupus; Prevention,Elizabeth E Brown

1K01MH116737-01A1,Adapting and Pilot Testing a Behavioral Intervention to Incorporate Advances in HIV Prevention for Black Young MSM in Alabama,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this 5-year Mentored Research Scientist Development K01-Award is to support Henna
Budhwani, PhD, MPH become an independent investigator in the field of HIV prevention. The proposed project
seeks to address the HIV crisis in Alabama, where rates of undiagnosed HIV in black young men who have sex
with men (YMSM, 18-29 years) exceed 20%. This project will adapt and test a behavioral intervention to promote
HIV rapid testing in the community, deliver culturally appropriate prevention education, offer sociostructural
supports, and refer eligible participants for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Four training objectives are
proposed that are in lockstep with three specific aims. Objective 1 includes an intensive training and mentoring
plan in social theory including theories of intersectionality and emerging masculinities. Objective 2 includes in-
depth training on qualitative research methods including how to conduct focus groups, in-depth interviews, and
qualitative data analysis. Aim 1, which will be conducted after Objective 2, is to elucidate experiences, beliefs,
and predictors related to delivery and utilization of HIV testing and prevention services by black YMSM using
qualitative research methods, namely in-depth interviews with HIV outreach staff, focus groups with black YMSM,
and in-depth interviews with members of key sub-groups (e.g. transgender women) to inform the adaptation of
the Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB) intervention. Objective 3 includes didactic and hands-on training on how to
scientifically adapt HIV behavioral interventions using validated frameworks, such as intervention mapping. Aim
2 is to adapt the BSB intervention to include two HIV prevention tools (rapid testing and PrEP), to address
structural barriers, and to be acceptable to black YMSM in Alabama. Objective 4 includes comprehensive training
and mentoring in the field of implementation science. Aim 3, which concludes the proposed research study and
K01 project, is to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation pilot study of the adapted intervention in
which the candidate will a) assess acceptability and feasibility of adapted BSB (aBSB); b) preliminarily estimate
effects on HIV prevention outcomes; and c) collect data on real-world implementation. These aims will be
accomplished by collaborating with two community-based organizations that are well-respected for their HIV
prevention work in study communities. This rigorous project includes intensive training at the candidate's home
university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and from other prominent institutions that offer very
specific training not found at UAB; engagement within the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS
Interventions (ATN); comprehensive mentoring from senior HIV researchers with expertise in minority, youth,
and MSM health; and a thoughtful research strategy that addresses significant threats, high rates of undiagnosed
HIV and insufficient engagement with HIV prevention services, including PrEP, in black YMSM in Alabama. The
combination of the proposed mentoring and training with study findings will culminate in the candidate's
attainment of independence and development of a full-scale, implementation science R01 proposal to test aBSB.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This research has the potential to make important contributions toward addressing some of the most significant
and current public health challenges in the United States, namely high rates of HIV infection and HIV-related
morbidity and mortality among black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, age 18-29). This study will do
so by adapting a behavioral intervention, Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB), to include two HIV prevention tools
(community-based rapid testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP), include sociostructural supports, and for
delivery in a new environment (Alabama in the United States Deep South), then testing the adapted intervention
employing an implementation science hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial design. Results of this
study, jointly with the formal training and mentoring the candidate will receive through this K01-Award, will prepare
her to develop a robust R01 proposal to conduct a regional, full-scale implementation science randomized
controlled trial of the adapted intervention across southern states and attain professional independence.",2019,179346,166342,13004,Other Research-Related,K01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Adolescent Sexual Activity; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention,Henna  Budhwani
3R01AG054538-02S1,ACE2 as a novel therapeutic to preserve physical function in late life,"ABSTRACT
Declining physical function and the onset of disability among older persons has a tremendous impact on the
health and longevity of affected individuals and is a central contributor to rising healthcare costs. Therapeutic
strategies for the preservation of physical function are currently limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a promising target for the development of new therapeutics to prevent
functional decline. However there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding the direct impact of a recently-
discovered vasodilatory arm of the RAS which is modulated primarily by the actions of the bioactive agent
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to convert angiotensin I and II to angiotensin-(1-7). This project will
address this gap in knowledge by evaluating the impact of directly administering ACE2 to older rats in the
preservation of physical function. We hypothesize that direct pharmacologic activation of the ACE2 axis will
attenuate functional declines in late life. We will address this hypothesis with three specific aims, which are to:
1) Demonstrate that systemic administration of ACE2 improves physical function among older Fischer 344 x
Brown Norway (F344/BN) rats, 2) Demonstrate that ACE2 improves functional responses to physical exercise,
and 3) Identify physiologic adaptations associated with functional responses to ACE2 administration both in
isolation and in combination with exercise. ANTICIPATED IMPACT: We have designed this study so that it has
potential to be swiftly translated to humans. This study will fill an important gap in knowledge while also
providing important data for the subsequent design of human studies to test our central hypothesis. The study
is significant in that it addresses several clinical and public health problems deemed significant by the NIH as
well as an important gap in the scientific literature. Innovations in the project include the reverse translation of
our prior work in this area, targeting of the RAS for health benefits other than the regulation of blood pressure,
and methodological innovations in the delivery of the therapeutic compound and the use of matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry to evaluate tissue-level adaptations to the
interventions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE
The maintenance of independent functioning is a key predictor of hospitalizations, surgical recovery, and
mortality among older adults. This project will provide valuable new information regarding the impact of a novel

5R01AG056769-03,ACES - ACE inhibitors Combined with Exercise for hypertensive Seniors,"ABSTRACT
The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to determine if choice of
antihypertensive medication influences changes in functional status and other cardiovascular risk factors
among older persons with hypertension. Functional status, determined by measures of physical performance,
is an important predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in older adults. Seniors with compromised function
experience more CV events, have a higher risk of undergoing cardiac surgery and higher risk of CVD-related
death than higher-functioning peers. Seniors with hypertension experience accelerated declines in function,
and presently physical exercise is the primary strategy for preventing this decline. However, functional
responses to exercise are highly variable and appear to be influenced by the type of antihypertensive
medication(s) utilized to control blood pressure. Preliminary evidence suggests that, compared to other first-
line antihypertensive agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance exercise-derived
improvements in functional status among hypertensive seniors. This RCT will test this hypothesis. Sedentary
men and women > 65 years of age with functional limitations and hypertension will be recruited from two sites
to participate in a 36 week intervention study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three first-line
antihypertensive agents: (1) the ACE inhibitor perindopril, (2) AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, or (3) the
thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. All participants will also participate in a structured aerobic exercise
intervention. The primary aim is to determine if, compared to losartan and HCTZ, perindopril improves self-
paced gait speed. The secondary aim is to determine the relative effect of perindopril on a) exercise capacity,
b) body mass and composition, and c) circulating indices of cardiovascular risk. In exploratory analyses,
skeletal muscle biopsies will be collected to evaluate the influence of study drugs on indices of skeletal muscle
angiogenesis. This study is expected to differentiate beneficial effects of three FDA-approved antihypertensive
medications on an emerging cardiovascular risk factor in a clinically-relevant population. Thus the study has
important implications for expeditiously influencing clinical practice guidelines in the prescription of
antihypertensive drugs to millions of Americans.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE â€“ Cardiovascular risk reduction among hypertensive older adults is an
important public health priority. This trial will provide critical data regarding the impact of current pharmacologic
and lifestyle-based hypertension strategies on established and emerging cardiovascular risk factors in this

3R01AG054538-03S1,ACE2 AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TO PRESERVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN LATE LIFE (Supplement 2),"ABSTRACT â€” This Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) Supplement application (NOT-AG-18-039) represents an
extension of our currently funded R01AG054538 Ace2 As A Novel Therapeutic To Preserve Physical Function
In Late Life in which we study the impact of modulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on age-related
declines in physical function. Here we propose to apply the same interventions used in the parent grant to the
study of cognitive frailty and AD. Cognitive frailty (simultaneous physical frailty and cognitive impairment)
represents an enormous clinical and public health challenge given the rapid aging of the worldwide population.
Individuals presenting with cognitive frailty have an increased risk for AD and other dementias. AD itself is a
progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with no effective method for treatment despite extensive research
focused on the brain as the target organ. We propose an exciting paradigm shift: directing intervention to the
gut microbiome as the target â€œorganâ€ to treat cognitive frailty symptoms and mitigate the progression of AD. We
have developed an innovative intervention whereby an orally-delivered probiotic incorporates delivery of
angiotensin (1-7) [Ang(1-7)] to the gut. Ang(1-7) is a key vasoprotective effector of the RAS and the enzyme
responsible for its production, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is abundant in the healthy gut.
Importantly, recent data from human and rodent studies suggest that severity of AD is inversely correlated with
circulating levels of Ang(1-7) and ACE-2. Here, we propose to address the hypothesis that the Ang(1-7)-
expressing probiotic will improve cognition in aged F344/BN rats and two preclinical models of AD: the Tg344-
AD rat and the hAPP,hBACE AD flies. Understanding the relationship between RAS, gut integrity, and
cognitive function is a new frontier in aging and AD risk research. Preclinical rodent models are invaluable;
however, Drosophila represents an ideal model as well: high throughput screening capabilities, low cost, fast
reproduction and an easily manipulated microbiome. Enzymes regulating RAS, are present in Drosophila, and
the fly ACE gene, AnCE, is inhibited by the same drugs that inhibit ACE in humans. A recent paper suggest
that enteric infection exacerbates inflammation and neurodegeneration in a fly model of AD. However, the use
of probiotics, whether genetically modified or otherwise, has yet to be studied using fly models of AD. Global
Specific Aim: Orally-administered probiotic expressing Ang (1-7) will enhance gut integrity, reverse gut
dysbiosis, reduce intestinal, systemic and tissue-specific inflammation, and improve cognitive function using
validated, comparative models of aging and AD: a) F344/BN rat; b) Tg344AD rat; c) hAPP, hBACE AD fly.","NARRATIVE â€” There is currently no cure for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), a condition which is devastating for

site for a program to prepare graduate students for careers in biomedical sciences. UAB is a comprehensive
research university and medical complex, classified as â€œdoctoral â€“ very research intensiveâ€. Its doctoral training
programs encompass all major research areas, including substantial strengths in the biomedical sciences. UAB
has an outstanding record of successful training for graduate students and a strong commitment to training
doctoral students from diverse backgrounds. UAB has established several (currently active) programs to help
both undergraduate students from underserved groups who aspire to doctoral careers and graduate students
who need financial support to pursue graduate studies. Specifically, the UAB PREP Scholars Program
(established in 2009) provides an additional pathway for a diverse pool of postbaccalaureate applicants to enter
doctoral programs in the biomedical sciences. Some undergraduate students from underserved groups decide
to pursue doctoral education too late in their college career, making them less competitive applicants that those
that decide earlier. Others may have had limited opportunities to engage in high-quality research experiences
due to limitations at their undergraduate institutions. The UAB PREP Scholars Program will provide these
individuals with significant financial and academic support, research experience, and educational and
professional development training to increase their competitiveness for entry into biomedical-related doctoral
graduate programs at top-tier research institutions and ensure success in completing their Ph.D. degrees. Our
overall goal for the UAB PREP Scholars Program is for 75% of participants to both enter and complete biomedical
doctoral graduate programs. During the training period, scholars will work with their faculty mentors to develop
an independent research project upon which they will spend 80% or more of their time. An individual development
plan (IDP) will also be designed for each student to address any academic weaknesses that might affect their
success in matriculating into doctoral graduate programs. In addition, extensive professional development
training will be provided to the scholars to strengthen writing and quantitative skills, raise awareness for career
options, develop presentation skills, discuss research ethics, and foster networking with peers at scientific
meetings, such as the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students. Progress of scholars
towards meeting the goals of their IDP will be monitored by regular meetings with PREP Directors and the

3U01DK106858-05S1,"Pathways to LUTS Prevention: A Model for Public Education, Behavioral Skills, and Early Detection","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms including urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, bladder pain syndrome, and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. There is an extensive literature describing the many approaches to treatment of LUTS, but much less is known about prevention. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors for LUTS, but evidence is lacking for the roles of behavioral factors, including how we learn our bladder habits,
whether they affect the risk of developing LUTS, and what defines healthy bladder habits. The primary aim of this proposal is to participate as a Clinical Center in the ""Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Women: Bladder Health Clinical Centers"" (PLUS) Research Consortium and work with other centers to examine the existing evidence and plan foundational studies for development of future trials of prevention interventions for LUTS. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Continence Team is an interdisciplinary group of investigators from behavioral science, geriatrics, preventive medicine, public health, urogynecology, and urology. Our epidemiological work includes identifying risk factors for incident incontinence using the NIA-funded UAB longitudinal Study of Aging, national VA databases, and risk factor analyses of NHANES data. The depth of the UAB team covers all aspects of LUTS clinical trial design and conduct (including NIH multi-site networks), evaluation and treatment of LUTS in women, and a strong track record of recruitment and retention of both patients and control subjects (including being a Vanguard Center for the NHLBI Women's Health Initiative). The second aim is to address known gaps in current epidemiological knowledge, through a prospective longitudinal cohort study to assess a range of behavioral factors and their effect on the incidence and progression of LUTS. Understanding the roles of bladder health behaviors will support the development of a risk model for identifying individuals and groups at risk for LUTS, as well as inform public education initiatives. The third aim is to conduct foundational studies guided by our conceptual framework to develop three potential pathways to prevention of LUTS: public education initiatives targeted across the lifespan to convey knowledge and dispel myths about healthy bladder habits and LUTS; skill-based interventions for young women and at-risk groups to teach evidence-based behavioral skills and healthy bladder habits; and detection of and self-administered interventions for early LUTS. The plan of studies includes 1) the longitudinal cohort study, which will also provide meaningful content for public education campaigns, 2) a survey of providers to assess feasibility of teaching pelvic floor muscle control and healthy bladder habits to young women at a time of relative readiness - the first gynecology encounter, and 3) developing and pilot testing an internet-based, self-administered behavioral intervention including a smart-phone application as a practical first step in addressing early LUTS. Findings from these studies will lay the foundation for future trials of interventions to prevent LUTS in women across the lifespan.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms that affect women of all ages.

5I01RX001059-06,Perioperative Post-Prostatectomy Incontinence Home Telehealth Program,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
   
 Telehealth is the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve patients' health status. Telehealth has been shown to be an effective means to deliver care to veterans in rural settings or in VA Medical Centers without expertise in specific disciplines. The VA Care Coordination / Home Telehealth (CCHT) Program has been highly successful with implementing patient education and monitoring programs using home messaging units for a wide variety of chronic and subacute conditions with over 300,000 veterans receiving care through CCHT in FY2010. Prostate cancer treatment, particularly radical prostatectomy, results in persistent incontinence that in patient surveys is significant enough to require long-term use of pads in 1 of 3 of men undergoing surgery. Although several randomized, controlled trials of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training have shown that it reduces duration and severity of post-operative incontinence for men undergoing prostate cancer surgery, most men do not receive this training because of lack of specially trained therapists.  This study will test an evidence-based perioperative pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format and pilot tested in a recently completed Rehab R&D-funded pilot/developmental trial in a randomized, controlled manner to determine if this training can be effectively delivered to veterans using home messaging units. Content is delivered in daily 10-minute sessions written at a 4th grade reading level. Each session ends with a fun fact, often about a famous person with successfully treated prostate cancer. In our pilot study, veterans reported that the home messaging units were easy to set up and use, that they appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with incontinence and empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves. The control group will also receive the telehealth device, but without the pelvic floor muscle training component to control the use of technology. Content for both groups will include general perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care management; and outcome measures. Only the treatment group will receive the pelvic floor muscle training which is started preoperatively and then continued postoperatively along with bladder control strategies - actively using muscles to prevent leakage, and adherence tips, prompts, and measures.  All outcome measures will be obtained using validated instruments administered via the home telehealth device, another novel part of the study. Data are transmitted nightly to a secure VA database as they are in the CCHT program. The primary outcome measure will be time to continence which is extremely important to the veteran who wants to recover bladder control as soon as possible after surgery, and is the outcome in most clinical incontinence trials. Other outcome measures include scores on a validated health-related quality of life tool specific to prostate cancer survivors; pad use; a measure of the impact of incontinence on daily activities, several other condition-specific quality
of life measures, and three validated global patient ratings of efficacy and satisfaction, as perceived by the veteran. Primary analysis will be intent-to-treat, using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and log rank test for time to continence and multiple regression, controlling for baseline for the other variables. A qualitative analysis will also be done, with veterans completing an in-person or telephone interview concerning their experience with the telehealth program.  If demonstrated efficacious, the program could be rapidly disseminated across VA through the Care Coordination / Home Telehealth Program so that all veterans undergoing radical prostatectomy can have evidenced-based perioperative pelvic floor muscle training and improved continence outcomes.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    
   
 The VA serves disproportionately more men than any other health care system. Prostate cancer affects I in 6 men, usually men 50 years and older who comprise the majority of the veteran population served by the VA. Patient survey studies have shown that prostate cancer surgery results in long-term incontinence, sufficient to require pads, in up to 1of 3 of men undergoing surgery. Incontinence can be a physical, emotional, psychosocial and economic burden for the men affected. An intervention to improve urine control after prostate cancer surgery will have a particularly significant impact on the quality of life of the veteran populatio. Therapies that can reduce persistent incontinence, such as the evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program proposed, are likely to result in cost-savings to the VA by reducing use of absorptive pads (provided to veterans by the VA) and by avoiding nursing home placement as these veterans age. Veterans successfully treated for incontinence will often tell you that you have given them their life back.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,KATHRYN Larsen BURGIO
5K23HL126570-05,"Enhancing information, motivation, and behavioral skills to promote antihypertensive medication adherence among persons living with HIV","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overarching goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Greer Burkholder, MD, MSPH, with the requisite training for development into an independent clinical investigator. Her focus on outcomes research and interventions to improve prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among persons living with HIV is novel and highly topical. Up to 15% of deaths among HIV-infected patients are due to CVD, and they experience increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke compared to the general population. Research on strategies to manage and prevent CVD is a priority of the NIH/NHLBI AIDS Program. Lowering risk for CVD relies heavily on pharmacotherapy for modifiable conditions such as hypertension, with medication adherence playing a prominent role. However, among HIV-infected patients adherence research has focused almost exclusively on ART, while antihypertensive medication adherence remains largely unstudied. Hypertension is common among HIV-infected patients and many have uncontrolled blood pressure. Formative research is needed to fill knowledge gaps regarding antihypertensive medication adherence and its impact on suboptimal blood pressure control among persons living with HIV. This foundational research is essential to inform interventions targeted toward improving antihypertensive medication adherence and CVD outcomes, in order to further enhance the gains in longevity and quality of life afforded by ART.  This K23 is grounded in the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, which has been widely used in ART adherence interventions and posits that three factors are required for adherence: 1) information regarding the condition and medications; 2) personal and social motivation; and 3) behavioral skills that enhance adherence. Informed by the IMB framework, this K23 scope of work will utilize quantitative and focus group research on antihypertensive medication adherence among HIV-infected patients to develop and pilot test an intervention to improve adherence and blood pressure control. Research will be conducted within two large, well-established HIV cohorts at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (n=3,028; Aims 1 and 2) and University of Washington (n=3,863, Aim 1 only). Hypothesis: Suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medications will be a significant contributor to uncontrolled blood pressure among HIV-infected patients with hypertension, and the information-motivation- behavioral skills (IMB) model will provide an effective framework for evaluating antihypertensive medication adherence and developing an intervention to improve adherence and blood pressure control in this population. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Evaluate the prevalence and correlates of adherence to antihypertensive medications among HIV- infected patients with hypertension and the impact of adherence on blood pressure control through a prospective cohort study at the UAB and UW HIV Clinics (n=400), and through focus group research at UAB. Aim 2: Develop and pilot test a tailored intervention to enhance adherence to antihypertensive medications and blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients, informed by the IMB framework and formative research from Aim 1.  These research aims will be complemented by training in advanced quantitative methods, health behavior, and intervention design, conduct, and evaluation under the guidance of expert mentors and advisors. Upon completion of these K23 activities, Dr. Burkholder will be poised to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial in the eight-site Center for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Systems (CNICS) cohort supported by an R01 grant, leveraging her training and resources to improve antihypertensive management and treatment outcomes among persons living with HIV.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of non-AIDS-related illness and death among persons living with HIV, and they are at higher risk for heart attack and stroke than uninfected persons. Hypertension, a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is common among HIV-infected patients, and nearly half with this condition have uncontrolled blood pressure. The project described in this application will develop and pilot test an intervention to improve adherence to blood pressure medications and blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients with the goal of reducing their risk for cardiovascular disease.",2019,189649,175601,14048,Other Research-Related,K23,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Infectious Diseases; Patient Safety; Prevention,Greer A Burkholder
3R15NS106460-01A1S1,Functional Analysis Of The Intersection of Mitochondrial Stress and Neurodegeneration,"Project Summary/Abstract
As our population ages, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD) comprise a major
societal burden. While mechanisms for PD etiology are still emerging, evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in
the pathogenesis of this disease is abundant. Another component of PD pathology is the protein a-synuclein
(a-syn); it is found within Lewy Body inclusions, yet causes of cellular toxicity remain unclear. A strategy that
mitochondria employ for managing stress is to engage the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt),
which coordinates nuclear expression of chaperones and proteases that translocate to the mitochondria to
handle damaged and/or unfolded proteins. When activated in response to acute stressors, the UPRmt re-
establishes homeostasis and promotes cell survival. However, it can become dysregulated when challenged
with a long-term genetic stressor such as misfolded a-syn and becomes cytotoxic. Notably, molecular variants
of a-syn can interact with TOMM20, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, and initiate a physical block of
mitochondrial protein import. We speculate that the increased UPRmt response observed in a-syn-expressing
neurons is a consequence of blocked mitochondrial import. Although attention to a role for mitochondrial
quality control in neurodegenerative disease has proven increasingly insightful, there is a pivotal gap that
remains to be addressed in demonstrating a direct functional correlation between dysregulated UPRmt activity
and neurodegeneration. Importantly, our research illustrates an insidious aspect of mitochondrial signaling in
which the UPRmt pathway exacerbates disruption of dopaminergic neurons in vivo, resulting in the neuron loss
characteristic of PD. Our approach exploits the expedience of genetic manipulation in Caenorhabditis elegans
research, and the rigor with which large, isogenic populations can be scored for neurodegeneration with
unprecedented accuracy, at the single-neuron level. We will systematically investigate combinations of
transgenic worms co-expressing structural variants of a-syn and transcription factors that activate the UPRmt to
discern functional requirements for UPRmt activation with neurodegeneration as the primary endpoint. The
studies in Aim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that the a-syn-TOMM20 mitochondrial import block triggers the
UPRmt pathway and will explore a role for dopamine in potentially exacerbating the deleterious consequences
of this process. As a distinct strategy, Aim 2 will involve the identification of molecular components associated
with UPRmt signaling through a forward genetic screening strategy that takes advantage of a strain we have
generated that reveals an uncharacterized compensatory mechanism for UPRmt induction. Phenotypic
bioassays and genetic screening using C. elegans are routinely conducted by undergraduates in our lab and
will serve as an excellent training opportunity for students through this R15 proposal. These studies represent
a timely and mechanistic strategy towards defining nuclear-mitochondrial dynamics, specifically with respect to
dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with potential to inform a translational path for therapeutic development.","Project Narrative
Parkinson Disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder affecting over 1 million Americans,
yet underlying causes of this neurodegenerative disease have largely eluded medical science. This
proposal is designed to address an unmet challenge of discerning how neurons respond to
mitochondrial stress and how this can lead to enhanced susceptibility to neurodegeneration.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying this cytotoxicity will be explored using genetics and a whole
animal model system whereby outcomes include limiting mitochondrial damage and neurodegeneration

5K01MH110651-03,Implementing treatment for adolescent depression in Ugandan schools,"Major depressive disorder is the leading cause for disability among adolescents globally, and most
young people do not receive treatment. Schools provide an unparalleled opportunity to reach early
adolescents and reduce the global mental health treatment gap. Situated throughout urban and rural
areas, schools are often located in communities with few-to-no other social service or health
infrastructure. Growing evidence indicates that mental health treatment can be effectively delivered in
low-resource schools by non-mental health professionals. However, a lack of research exists on
schools-based treatment interventions for depression, especially in low and middle-income countries, or
how to implement them within educational systems. This K01 proposes a multi-phase research study
to implement Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-G-A) in schools in
Uganda. IPT-G-A is a manualized depression intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness with
adolescents in Uganda, but has not yet been implemented or scaled-up in school settings. This
project aims to understand the factors relevant to implementation and effectiveness of
depression treatment in Ugandan schools and pilot a strategy for implementing IPT-G-A,
leveraging an existing violence prevention program called the Good School Toolkit (GST).

5U01DP006302-03,Prioritizing county-level social determinants that contribute to the greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the US,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have begun to increase in the US after decades of decline.
Although the reasons underlying this increase in CVD deaths are unclear, the prevention, detection, and
optimal treatment of CVD risk factors (i.e., diabetes and hypertension) will be essential for preventing any
further increases in CVD mortality. Currently, 14% of adults in the US have diabetes, of which 1 in 3 is
undiagnosed, and 29% of adults have hypertension. However, stark disparities exist in the CVD risk factor
burden, particularly by social determinants of health. These determinants are key contributors to the
development of diabetes and hypertension. Yet, they have largely been omitted from clinical practice and
decision-making. There is increasing awareness of the influence of social determinants on health outcomes,
but it is not clear exactly which factors should be assessed or how to integrate this information into current
practice. Social determinants of health are extensive, so it is important to characterize those that are likely to
have the greatest influence on the prevention, treatment and control of diabetes and hypertension and may be
used to inform the development of targeted programs and policies. We propose to investigate the community
and individual social determinants that contribute to a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the
southeastern US by leveraging national databases, the Medicare claims administrative database and the
infrastructure of a prospective cohort study, the NIH-funded Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in
Stroke (REGARDS) study, that enrolled 30,239 middle-aged and older adults in 2003-07. We will build upon
these resources to address the following aims: 1) determine the association of county-level social determinants
of health with the county-level prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, in the
southeastern US; 2) evaluate the association of county-level social determinants of health with the county-level
prevalence and incidence of diabetes and hypertension, separately, among older adults in the southeastern
US using the Medicare database; and 3) evaluate the association of county-level and individual-level social
determinants of health with individual-level prevalent and incident diabetes and hypertension, separately,
among REGARDS participants in the southeastern US. This proposal will prioritize those social determinants
of health that are associated with a greater burden of diabetes and hypertension in the southeastern US and
help guide prevention programs and interventions to reduce this excess risk.","PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE

5K01CA190559-05,"The Interplay of Behavior, Environment, and Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Risk","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Tiffany Carson is an applied epidemiologist with a background in studying health disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's early work focused on behaviors related to diet, physical activity, obesity and related health outcomes. Recently, Dr. Carson has focused on applying her research efforts to better understand cancer disparities of black and white women. Dr. Carson's overarching career goal is to become an independently funded investigator and develop evidence-based bio-behavioral interventions to reduce cancer health disparities. To that end, this application proposes a rigorous research project and training plan focused on investigating the microbiota as a novel potential contributor to colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities between black and white women. CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States   
accounting for 9% of cancer deaths. Known risk factors for CRC include increasing age, male sex, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, high consumption of red and processed meats and high fat diet, and obesity. Among women, even after accounting for differences in the distribution of risk factors, black women remain at 48% greater risk for CRC than white women. There is a growing body of research suggesting that the influence of diet on CRC risk is mediated through the microbiota and that microbial perturbations caused by diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics can lead to increased risk for CRC and other chronic diseases. Stress is one factor that has been shown to lead to alterations in the microbiota. Our research has shown that black women report moderate to high stress levels and additional published literature indicates that black women report higher stress levels than their white counterparts. These observations have lead to our hypothesis that a greater proportion of black women have a perturbed microbiota as a result of higher stress levels compared to white women, putting black women at greater risk for developing CRC. In the present proposal, we plan to explore this hypothesis employing a case control study design comparing the following groups: 1) black and white women with incident CRC from the Kirklin Clinic at UAB and 2) age-matched cancer-free black and white female community controls. Specifically, we will first characterize the oral and gut microbiota of black and white women with CRC and compare by race with particular focus on microbes known to be either positively or negatively associated with CRC. Because all cases will have CRC, we hypothesize that there will be no significant racial differences in the microbiota or other known risk factors for CRC such as diet. In contrast, when we repeat this experiment in cancer-free black and white female community controls, we expect to observe racial differences in the microbiota, with black women having less health-promoting bacteria and more pathogenic bacteria than white women, which would put black women at increased risk for CRC. We anticipate that a greater proportion of black females in the control group will have microbiota that resembles the microbiota of participants with CRC. Additionally, if our hypothesis is supported, psychological stress with be inversely associated with health-promoting bacteria and positively associated with pathogenic bacteria. Our findings will provide insight into how lifestyle factors that have not been fully explored to date such as stress may be associated with risk for CRC as a result of how stress perturbs the microbiota. If we determine that stress contributes to CRC risk via microbial perturbations, future bio-behavioral interventions that incorporate stress management and dietary/supplemental recommendations to promote mucosal health, and therefore reduce CRC risk, can be developed and implemented which could lead to diminished health care costs related to diagnosis and treatment and reduce CRC disparities between black and white women. In addition to providing valuable data, the proposed research project will also provide the opportunity for the additional training needed for Dr. Carson's development as an independently funded bio-behavioral cancer disparities researcher. Dr. Carson will engage in an intensive, structured training experience to develop expertise by completing the following: 1) Training in the recruitment of racially diverse clinical and community populations for bio-specimen and bio-banking research, 2) Obtaining hands-on and didactic training in bioinformatics techniques, and 3) Improving professional skills such as team science, networking, grant writing, mentoring, and high-impact publications.

5R01ES015981-12,Lung Macrophage Metabolic Reprogramming in Asbestos-Induced Toxicity,"Asbestos-induced toxicity remains to be a significant environmental condition. Despite strict regulatory
controls to limit exposure, more than 1.3 million workers are exposed to hazardous levels of asbestos every
year, which results in more than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. One critical factor that
contributes to the severity of toxicity in asbestos exposure is the generation of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS),
which modulates alternative activation of lung macrophages; however, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating
macrophage mtROS generation is not clearly defined. One of the NOX enzymes, NOX4, induces mtROS with
various stimuli and in several cell types, but the modulation of the macrophage phenotype is not known to be
mediated by NOX4. Our preliminary data show that lung macrophages from asbestos-injured subjects express
high levels of the NOX4 gene compared to normal subjects. Inhibition or silencing NOX4 significantly
abrogates mtROS. More importantly, the NOX1/4 inhibitor (GKT137831) abolishes alternative activation of
macrophages. One important characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages is metabolic reprogramming
from glycolytic metabolism to fatty acid oxidation, which is necessary to support long-term cellular activities.
NOX1/4 inhibition attenuates asbestos-induced fatty acid oxidation. Similar observations were recapitulated in
NOX4-/- mice. Lung macrophages from NOX4-/- mice displayed classical activation unlike the wild type mice,
which had pro-fibrotic activation of macrophages. Furthermore, NOX4-/- mice were protected from asbestos-
induced toxicity. Our hypothesis is that NOX4-mediated mtROS modulates metabolic reprogramming,
alternative activation, and apoptosis resistance of lung macrophages, which promotes asbestos-induced
toxicity. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1, the role of macrophage NOX4 in
macrophage plasticity and in the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced toxicity will be tested in mice harboring a
deletion of NOX4 in macrophages. Aim 2 will test the role of NOX4-derived mtROS in metabolic
reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity using genetic approaches in asbestos-exposed macrophages. Aim 3
will test the role of NOX4 on the metabolism and phenotype of lung macrophages from asbestos-injured
subjects ex vivo with GKT137831 and RNAi-mediated NOX4 silencing. These studies may uncover NOX4 as
an ideal therapeutic target to attenuate asbestos-induced toxicity by modulating mitochondrial metabolism and
macrophage plasticity.","There is no current therapy that reduces mortality in asbestos-induced toxicity. Lung
macrophages, which are the initial defense-fighting cell in the lung, have a critical role in
asbestos-induced toxicity. The studies in this application will define the molecular
mechanism(s) that regulate metabolism and function of lung macrophages and may
identify a therapeutic target for preventing toxicity from asbestos exposure.",2019,333208,225000,108208,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Genetics; Lung,A BRENT CARTER
1I01CX001715-01A2,Pulmonary fibrosis is modulated by MCU-mediated macrophage apoptosis resistance,"! In fibrotic disorders of the lung, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung macrophages have a
decisive role in fibrotic repair of injured lung. Macrophages play an integral role in the normal resolution of
organ injury but also contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by initiating an immune response and
by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly mitochondrial ROS (mtROS). Lung remodeling
during pulmonary fibrosis is poorly understood; however, changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics in monocyte-
derived macrophages are emerging as a critical determinant of fibrotic repair. The generation of mtROS is
linked to calcium (Ca2+) influx into the mitochondria, which is regulated, in part, by the mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter (MCU). Macrophages in chronic disease typically exhibit apoptosis resistance, and their prolonged
survival is associated with disease progression. Metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is a key
feature in macrophage activation. The relative efficiency of FAO is well suited to meet the metabolic
requirements necessary for the repair of injured tissue. Our preliminary data show that lung macrophages from
IPF subjects have increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 (PGC-1a),
a transcription factor that leads to increased enzymatic capacity for FAO, carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA
(CPT1A), the rate limiting mitochondrial lipid transporter, and mitochondrial Bcl-2 compared to normal subjects.
MCU deficiency attenuates PGC-1a expression, and dominant-negative (DN)-MCU expression abrogates
FAO. These findings are relevant because by generating reciprocal bone marrow chimeras using WT and
MCU+/- mice, we found mice that received MCU+/- bone marrow were protected from bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis.
 We hypothesize that MCU mediates pulmonary fibrosis by metabolic reprogramming of lung macrophages
to induce apoptosis resistance. We will test this hypothesis with three aims.
 Aim 1 will test if MCU modulates macrophage metabolic reprogramming to FAO and if MCU is required for
pulmonary fibrosis utilizing mice harboring expression of a dominant-negative (DN)-MCU in monocyte-derived
macrophages.
 In Aim 2, we will test if MCU mediates apoptosis resistance by inducing metabolic reprogramming to FAO
and enhancing expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that bind to CPT1a using genetic approaches and in
mice harboring expression of DN-MCU or a deletion of Bcl-2 in monocyte-derived macrophages.
 Aim 3 will provide human biological evidence of the importance of MCU in fibrosis development by
determining if modulation of MCU in lung macrophages from IPF subjects regulates FAO and resistance to
apoptosis. Understanding the role of MCU in lung macrophages may provide an important target for preventing
or halting progression of fibrosis.","ThereÂ  isÂ  noÂ  currentÂ  therapyÂ  thatÂ  reducesÂ  progressionÂ  orÂ  mortalityÂ  inÂ  pulmonaryÂ  fibrosis,Â

5P01HL114470-07,Metabolic Regulation of Pro-Fibrotic Macrophages in Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is increasing in prevalence, and the recently approved anti-fibrotic
therapies have limited efficacy. Alveolar macrophages have a critical role lung injury and repair. Macrophages
in chronic disease typically exhibit apoptosis resistance, and their prolonged survival is generally associated
with disease progression due to polarization to a pro-fibrotic phenotype. The generation of mitochondrial ROS
(mtROS) in alveolar macrophages modulates pro-fibrotic polarization; however, the molecular mechanism(s)
regulating macrophage mtROS in fibrosis is not clearly defined. One of the NOX enzymes, NOX4, generates
mtROS with various stimuli and in several cell types, but the modulation of the macrophage phenotype has not
been linked to NOX4. Our preliminary data show that alveolar macrophages from IPF subjects express high
levels of the NOX4 gene compared to normal subjects, and there is more NOX4 localized in the mitochondria
of IPF alveolar macrophages. NOX1/4 inhibition with GKT137831 or silencing NOX4 significantly abrogates
mtROS. Moreover, GKT137831 down regulates pro-fibrotic polarization of macrophages and abrogates fatty
acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, which is characteristic metabolism for pro-fibrotic macrophages.
In vivo, NOX4 modulates the polarization of alveolar macrophages to a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In addition,
NOX4-/- mice, which are protected from pulmonary fibrosis, have significantly less alveolar macrophages in the
BAL fluid suggesting either a defect in recruitment or an absence of apoptosis resistance. Our hypothesis is
that NOX4 modulates macrophage mtROS and metabolism to polarize alveolar macrophages to a pro-fibrotic
phenotype that is critical for fibrosis development. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. Aim 1
will determine if the Nox1/4 inhibitor (GKT137831) modulates alveolar macrophage metabolism and phenotype
in IPF subjects enrolled in a Phase IIb clinical trial. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of NOX4 in
regulating mitochondrial metabolism and alveolar macrophage phenotype using pharmacologic (GKT137831)
and genetic approaches. Aim 3 will determine macrophage-specific roles of NOX4 in regulating fibrotic
responses to lung injury utilizing mice harboring a conditional deletion of NOX4 in macrophages. These studies
may delineate NOX4 as a critical regulator of metabolism and macrophage plasticity suggesting it is an ideal
therapeutic target to halt progression or reverse pulmonary fibrosis.","There is no current therapy that reduces mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

The overall goal of the Outreach Core of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to implement and evaluate,
Cancer Care Connect, an innovative enhanced care coordination model for cancer survivors that links health
system patient navigators (HSPNs) and survivorship care plans (SCPs) with community-based patient
navigators (CBPNs) to improve satisfaction with care, satisfaction with navigation services, and quality of life
among cancer survivors. The accomplishment of the study's goal will be facilitated by the Partnership's
decade-long history of recruiting, training, and engaging lay community health workers/advisors to promote
age-appropriate cancer screening, healthy lifestyles, and enrollment in cancer clinical trials. The patient
navigation model used by the Partnership has been successful in the context of cancer prevention, and now it
will be expanded to cover the entire cancer continuum, from diagnosis through survivorship. To our knowledge,
this will be the first study to extend patient care coordination from the health system to the community using
community navigation and SCPs. Following a baseline assessment, patients with a HSPN and SCP will be
linked to a CBPN, and the impact of the combined health system-based and community-based navigation will
be evaluated at multiple time points. We anticipate that cancer survivors receiving the Cancer Care Connect
will increase satisfaction with care, increase satisfaction with navigation services, and improved quality of life.Â ","8. PROJECT NARRATIVE

1F31HD097903-01A1,Restless legs syndrome and physical activity in adults with multiple sclerosis,"Abstract
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs
with an unknown etiology that affects as many as 65% of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). There are
currently no FDA approved treatments for RLS in persons with MS and the current pharmacological treatments
are associated with a number of side effects, including the worsening of symptoms (i.e., augmentation). There
further are no evidence-based behavioral approaches for managing RLS in persons with MS. Physical activity
represents a promising, behavioral rehabilitation approach for managing symptoms of RLS in MS. To date,
physical activity has demonstrated tremendous benefits for managing many consequences of MS, but there is
no evidence on its efficacy for managing RLS in MS. This research proposes two methods for evaluating
physical activity as an approach to manage symptoms of RLS in adults with MS and represents the first-step in
establishing a research agenda that examines the efficacy of physical activity for inclusion in medical
rehabilitation for managing RLS in MS. The first-step is a cross-sectional design that examines the relationship
between physical activity behavior and RLS severity as it will describe the association in a large sample of
individuals with MS and RLS. Those with RLS who engage in more physical activity (i.e., spend more time in
light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) are expected to have a lower severity of RLS symptoms than
those who spend less time physically active. The second-step involves a clinical trials experience within a
randomized controlled trial and further permits an examination of the efficacy of physical activity for managing
symptoms of RLS. This will be accomplished by directly comparing the effect of a six-month physical activity
behavioral intervention with a control intervention on RLS severity. The hypothesis is that RLS symptom
severity will be reduced for those who increase physical activity behavior as a result of the intervention. This
project is vital to persons with MS, as it will be the first focal investigation of a possible behavioral intervention
for managing RLS in MS. This project is a crucial first-step for informing future randomized controlled trials and
designing larger-scale studies that can establish efficacy and effectiveness of physical activity for the
management of RLS symptoms in persons with MS. This is consistent with the PIâ€™s long-term interests in
designing an appropriate behavioral rehabilitation approach to maximize the reduction of RLS symptoms and
improve common correlates of RLS in neurological conditions.","Project Narrative

1R01GM127371-01A1,Regulation of apical constriction of bottle cells by the RhoGEF protein Plekhg5 during gastrulation morphogenesis,"Apical constriction is a cell shape change that associates with cell ingression, bending of epithelial
sheet, and formation of tubular structures. It is found in many morphogenetic processes, such as
gastrulation, neural tube closure, and sensory organ formation. Failure in apical constriction can
cause human congenital diseases, such as neural tube defects. Despite the importance of apical
constriction in multiple developmental contexts, molecular regulators of apical constriction are not
understood completely. Rho signaling has been implicated previously in apical constriction during
vertebrate neural tube closure and sensory placode invagination. However, general activation of Rho
throughout a cell does not lead to apical constriction, underscoring that polarized stimulation of Rho
within particular subcellular compartment is crucial. Spatial regulation of Rho activities is normally
achieved by Rho regulators GEFs and GAPs. Over 20 members each of RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs
perform diverse cellular functions. The identity of Rho regulators in apical constriction in vertebrates
is not well defined, and the mechanisms via which Rho regulators act to control cell shape changes
are not described in detail. This knowledge gap, combined with the importance of apical constriction
in embryogenesis, demands further investigation about molecular machinery controlling apical
constriction. In our current study, we identified plekhg5 as a RhoGEF expressed in the bottle cells of
the blastopore lip during Xenopus gastrulation and had a function in regulating apical constriction of
the bottle cells. Plekhg5 protein is apically localized and stimulates apical actomyosin assembly to
induce ectopic blastopore lip in a Rho-dependent fashion when ectopically expressed. Knockdown of
plekhg5 blocks apical constriction of bottle cells at the blastopore lip and prevents activin from
inducing blastopore lip in the ectoderm. Plekhg5 is thus an endogenous RhoGEF in bottle cells that
participates in regulation of apical constriction during gastrulation. The activity of plekhg5 provides us
an excellent opportunity to address some of the key issues regarding apical constriction in any tissue
contexts, namely how Rho regulators are recruited to particular subcellular compartment(s) to exert
their function (aim 1); how they modulate dynamic actomyosin organization to coordinate reduction
of apical cell surface and adhesion complex remodeling (aim 2); and how different downstream
effectors are involved in regulating distinct aspects of actomyosin dynamics and cell shape changes
(aim 3). Completion of the proposed studies will offer us deeper insight into molecular control of apical
constriction and provide us a platform to investigate and compare molecular mechanisms governing
apical constriction in diverse tissue contexts. The results may also contribute to our understanding of
human diseases caused by abnormal epithelial morphogenesis due to defects in apical constriction.","Epithelial morphogenesis is an important process both during vertebrate embryogenesis and in tissue
remodeling in adults, yet molecular regulators of this process are not understood comprehensively.
This project will investigate a key protein that controls cell shape changes during a crucial
morphogenetic event in vertebrate embryogenesis. Results will advance our knowledge on molecular
regulation of epithelial morphogenesis and potentially uncover new targets underlying human
diseases.",2019,333668,224692,108976,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Pediatric,CHENBEI  CHANG; RAYMOND E KELLER
1K23AT010567-01,Feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overall objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to support and develop
Dr. Chapman Lambertâ€™s transition to an independent investigator in mind and body research with a focus on
developing, integrating, and testing mind and body strategies to improve clinical, psychological, and physical
outcomes among African American (AA) women living with HIV (WLWH). HIV viral load (VL) suppression among
AA WLWH are suboptimal when compared to women of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Two essential self-
care behaviors for people living with HIV (PLWH) to achieve and sustain HIV VL suppression ad improve health
outcomes and survival are adherence to antiretroviral therapy and scheduled medical visits. Medical visit
adherence is suboptimal among women in general, but VL suppression rates among AA WLWH are suboptimal
with AA WLWH being nearly 3 times more likely than White WLWH not to achieve viral suppression. One
important factor associated with adherence behaviors is stressful life events including traumatic life events. Thus,
there is a critical need to develop culturally appropriate interventions aimed reducing stress and improving
adherence behaviors and VL suppression. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon
Kabat-Zinn, has the potential to reduced stress through self-regulation of attention and awareness to stressful
events. MBSR has demonstrated efficacy in improving stress management, psychological distress, physical and
psychological symptoms, quality of life, and coping as well as ART adherence in predominately white and male
patient populations. We propose to culturally adapt the MSBR intervention for AA WLWH to reduce stress and
enhance HIV self-care behaviors and VL suppression, which has the potential to attenuate prominent racial and
gender disparities experienced by AA WLWH in the US. Specifically, we aim to 1) culturally adapt the MBSR
intervention for AA WLWH using ADAPT-ITT; 2) pre-pilot the adapted intervention via an open non-randomized
pilot study to further refine the culturally adapted intervention; and 3) conduct a 2-armed pilot test of the
behavioral intervention compared to standard of care to assess the feasibility and acceptability the adapted
MBSR intervention for AA WLWH. Findings from this study will provide an important first step in establishing my
program of research as an independent investigator in stress-related morbidity and HIV treatment adherence. In
addition, findings maybe applicable for other chronic conditions and marginalized populations living with and
without HIV.","Project Narrative

research career as a result of exposure to research during medical school. Therefore, by providing mentored
short-term research experiences for medical students, and aligning students with a physician/surgeon-scientist
role model, opportunity exists to influence the career choices of medical students and address the deficit in the
number of physician/surgeon-scientists entering the workforce. The Short-Term Research Experiences
Advancing Medical Students (STREAMS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) offers summer
research fellowships with the goal of encouraging medical students to pursue research careers, particularly in
research areas related to the mission of NIDDK. This proposal seeks support to provide a formal program with
stipend support to promising medical students engaged in an 8-12 week, mentored research experience with
the goal of encouraging students to seriously consider careers in academic medicine and enhance the pipeline
of physicians and surgeons with potential to pursue academic careers with NIDDK-related research interests.
UAB is ideally suited for this program; the program boasts outstanding leadership, an environment that
promotes engagement of medical students in research, a well-funded group of trainers with extensive
commitment to medical student mentorship, a diverse pool of potential trainees, a wide breadth of research
opportunities including health disparities research, and matching institutional support. UAB is also home to 5
NIDDK funded research centers. Furthermore, while there are thirteen AAMC accredited medical schools in
the Deep South, only three T35s targeting short-term experiences for medical students have been awarded to
these institutions. There are no NIDDK-funded T35s held by institutions in Alabama or the neighboring states
of Mississippi and Georgia. By partnering medical students with successful physician/surgeon scientists who
will serve as research role models, we aim to increase the future pool of physician/surgeon scientists in the
southeast.","RELEVANCE

Abstract: Building predictive models of immunity requires comprehensive understanding of the complex and
dynamic functional behavior of immune system. A need for such understanding is obvious with a number of
immune related diseases for which viable treatments are not currently available. Cytokines are well-studied
proteins secreted by immune cells and essential for intercellular signaling to regulate the maturation, growth,
and responsiveness of particular cell populations. Previous studies suggest that quantification of cytokine-based
immune fingerprints provides clinically and immunologically useful information related to infectious diseases,
cancer, autoimmune diseases, and allergy transplantation. The ongoing revolution in fundamental biology,
immunology and clinical discovery critically hinges on the availability of diagnostic tools capable of decentralized
point-of-care measurements to provide immediate quantitative information of cytokine levels at the bedside or in
the clinic. Current existing clinical technology is mainly based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The complex labelling and washing processes require a total assay time up to more than a few hours and a
sample volume of 0.1- 2 mL per test per patient, which greatly hinders its application for immune monitoring at
the point of care. Thus, there is an emerging clinical demand for transformative platforms that can perform multi-
parametric cytokine detection to understand the dynamical immune response of the patient in a rapid and
accurate manner. This requires collecting time series data that could be on the order of seconds for ion transport,
to hours for changes in protein levels, and to days for phenotypic changes in host body with sensor sensitivity
from biological relevant concentration to single molecular level using minimum sample volume. To address this
need, the central objectives of this MIRA application are to develop integrated optofluidic nanoplasmonic
biosensing platforms for rapid, high throughput, sensitive and multiplex cytokine detection from whole blood to
single-cell level towards next-generation point-of-care immunoassays. The PI proposes the following three
projects: 1) Label free, ultra-sensitive, high throughput nanoplasmonic serum immunoassay for real-time immune
monitoring; 2) Multi-parametric cellular functional immunophenotyping assay for personalized
immunomodulatory therapy; 3) Nanoplasmon ruler for direct visualization of single-cell cytokine secretion and
cell-to-cell communication. The planned multi-scale research both experimentally and theoretically will bridge
the gap in fundamental understanding of immune system and enhance the applicability, diagnosis and prediction
power for immune system diseases. The proposed platforms would ultimately gear the biologists and clinicians
with capability to real-time monitor the immune status in patients, a transformative achievement that has
enormous implications to fundamental research and clinical applications.","Currently, physicians do not monitor the function of the immune system in patients due to the lack of available
immune monitoring tools. Our proposed research is set to address specifically this critical issue, by developing
next generation immunomonitoring technology to provide real-time information of cytokine-mediated immune

5R01AR070135-03,Characterizing the mechanism by which endogenous negative regulators of osteoclasts control bone homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions in mouse models,"The immediate goal of this application is to understand how osteoclast (OC) differentiation is regulated through
negative endogenous regulators, which may provide novel therapeutic targets for bone diseases, such as
osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although positive regulators of OC differentiation through the
receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (RANK) ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling axis have been extensively
studied, understanding of negative regulators of OC differentiation is elusive. To identify key negative regulators
of OC differentiation, we utilized microarray, gene downregulation, and osteoclastogenesis assays, leading to
the isolation of guanine protein alpha subunit 13 (GÎ±13, encoded by the Gna13 gene) as a potential OC negative
regulator. To enable in vivo investigation of the role of GÎ±13 in OC differentiation, we generated an OC-lineage
specific Gna13 conditional knockout (CKO) mouse model by crossing Gna13f/f mice with LysM-Cre (OC
precursor specific) mice. Our preliminary data showed that Gna13f/fLysM-Cre mice exhibited a severe
osteoporosis from a drastic increase in OC differentiation. We also noted that GÎ±13 deficiency attenuates RhoA
activity and promotes Akt activity in OCs. Consistently, we showed that, as a proof of principle strategy, local
constitutively active GÎ±13 overexpression can protect against bone and cartilage loss while also attenuating
inflammation in a mouse model of RA. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that GÎ±13 is a key
negative regulator of OC that controls OC cell lineage commitment and differentiation for bone homeostasis
under physiological and pathological conditions through activating RhoA and attenuating AKT signaling pathway.
Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the bone phenotypes of
GnÎ±13f/fLysM-Cre mice and elucidate the mechanism underlying how GÎ±13 activates RhoA signaling and
attenuates Akt signaling to negatively regulate OC cell lineage commitment and differentiation. In Aim 2 we will
determine the upstream GÎ±13 signaling cascade in OCs through characterization of G protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) coupled with GÎ±13. We will characterize the mechanism underlying the roles of GÎ±13 in bone
remodeling and pathological bone loss by using dendritic cell (DC)-, monocyte- and OC-specific Gna13 CKO and
overexpression transgenic mice in the loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis, respectively. This study
may provide important insights into the roles of negative regulators of OC differentiation in bone homeostasis
and osteolytic bone diseases of excessive OC differentiation. Knowledge gained from this study may generate
potential therapeutic targets, through characterization of GÎ±13 signaling in OCs that may be targeted in treating
osteolytic bone diseases by mimicking normal OC inhibitory signaling pathway to control OC formation. A
multidisciplinary research team, including a bone biologist with expertise in OC biology and animal models of
bone diseases; a bone biologist with expertise in OC biology and cell signaling; and an immunologist with
expertise in autoimmunity diseases including RA has been established to achieve the research goal.","Project Narrative

1R01AG056438-01A1,CbfÎ² mediates articular cartilage regeneration and repair in aging,"The long term goal of this study is to develop a safer and more effective therapeutic approach to cure aging-
associated osteoarthritis (OA). The immediate goal of this study is to characterize the mechanism underlying
how core-binding factor beta (CbfÎ²) mediates articular cartilage regeneration and repair in aging-associated
OA. Current therapeutic options for aging-associated OA are still limited to pain management and surgical
intervention representing a significant concern in the aging population. Recent studies have shed light on the
nature of OA genetic susceptibility and confirmed a number of candidate genes involved in damage of the
articular cartilage, including Sox9, YAP, Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and TGFÎ²/BMP signaling. However, the root
causes of the disease remain unclear. In our preliminary studies, we found that the expression of CbfÎ²
decreases with age in mouse articular cartilage, while postnatal induced chondrocyte-specific CbfÎ²-deficient
mice developed spontaneous OA-like phenotype characterized by articular cartilage degradation and
subchondral bone intrusion, which was exacerbated with age. Notably, heatmap analysis of RNA-seq data
showed that CbfÎ²f/fCol2Î±1-Cre and aging mice articular cartilage share very similar changes in the gene
expression profiles compared with that of two-month-old mouse articular cartilage. Our qPCR data confirmed
that the OA related gene expression changes in articular cartilage of aging-associated and CbfÎ² deficiency
induced OA included downregulated Sox9, BMP7, ALK3 and upregulated Yap, Wnt5a/b, Wnt/Î²-catenin
BMP2/4. In addition, AAV-CMV-CbfÎ² mediated CbfÎ² overexpression with local administration protected against
surgical OA in mice. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that deficiency of CbfÎ² is one of the main
causes of articular cartilage degeneration in aging-associated osteoarthritis (OA), and CbfÎ² enhances articular
cartilage regeneration and repair by modulating multiple key signaling pathways, including Wnt/Î²-catenin,
BMP/TGFÎ², YAP and Sox9 signaling pathways. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. In
Aim1, We determine the roles of CbfÎ² in articular cartilage regeneration and repair in aging-associated
osteoarthritis through analyses of adult and aged CbfÎ²f/fAggrecan-CreER mice, and aged wild type mice in
physiological and pathological conditions via a loss-of-function approach. In Aim 2, we characterize the
function of CbfÎ² in articular cartilage regeneration and repair and preventing OA genesis in adult and aged
mice via a gain-of-function approach using AAV-CMV-CbfÎ² and CbfÎ²OEf/fAggrecan-CreER gene
overexpression models. We will dissect the mechanism underlying how CbfÎ² enhances articular cartilage
regeneration and repair by regulating the Wnt/Î²-catenin, BMP/TGFÎ², YAP, and Sox9 signaling pathways in
aging-associated OA in Aim 3. Insights gained from the proposed study will not only address the basic
scientific question about the pathogenesis of aging-associated OA, but also will provide the foundation for the

1R01HL146103-01,Circadian regulation of vascular aging,"Vascular aging, the age-related molecular, structural and functional changes in the blood vessels, not
only impairs normal vascular contraction and compliance but also increases the incidence of cardiovascular
disease, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke and peripheral artery disease, as
well as vascular complications in metabolic disease, such as diabetes. Therefore, better understanding of the
molecular regulation of vascular aging may offer greater opportunities to identify promising targets for potential
novel clinical interventions to prevent or retard vascular aging and age-related cardiovascular disease.
 The current application aims to fill the unmet scientific gaps to elucidate the molecular determinants in
vascular aging. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, migration, mineralization, extracellular matrix
(ECM) deposition, and senescence contribute to age-related vascular structural and functional changes. As a
result, increased medial and neointimal thickness, arterial stiffness, ECM degradation and calcification are
manifestations of vascular aging, which promotes cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis,
hypertension, vascular calcification and stroke. We found that a key transcription factor Runx2 is elevated in an
age-dependent manner, and SMC-specific deletion of Runx2 inhibited vascular complications that are more
pronounced in aging, including atherosclerosis, neointimal formation and vascular calcification. Furthermore,
Runx2 deficiency in VSMC inhibited the expression of VSMC matrix proteins and senescence, two hallmarks of
VSMC aging, supporting a novel function of Runx2 in regulating vascular aging that is beyond its known function
in regulating VSMC calcification. Mechanistically, we identified a previously unrecognized Runx2 oscillation in
VSMC in culture as well as in mouse arteries in vivo. Runx2 oscillation in VSMC was associated with the
oscillation of the key clock regulator, BMAL1, and the clock-regulated FOXO1. Coincidently, increased
expression of BMAL1 and FOXO1 was demonstrated in aging arterials, similar to that of Runx2. With the use of
loss-of-function approaches, our preliminary studies further demonstrated a causative function of circadian clock
(BMAL1) and O-GlcNAcylation in regulating Runx2 expression. These results support the hypothesis that
interplay of clock rhythm and protein O-GlcNAcylation promotes vascular aging through the
FOXO/Runx2 signaling axis. Using novel inducible SMC-specific BMAL1, OGT and Runx2 deficient animal
models, the proposal will characterize circadian clock-regulated vascular aging in mice (Aim 1); and delineate
mechanisms underlying circadian regulation of vascular aging (Aim 2). Results from the proposed studies will
develop a novel paradigm underlying vascular clock and O-GlcNAcylation regulation of the FOXO/Runx2 signaling
axis in vascular aging, which will advance our understanding of basic mechanisms governing vascular aging. As
vascular aging promotes many diseases, the novel mechanisms uncovered in this application should also have

5R01HL136165-03,Regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell function in atherosclerosis,"ABSTRACT Regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) phenotype and function plays important
roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Vascular calcification is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis
that predicts adverse cardiovascular outcome of atherosclerotic patients. Over the last two decades, increasing
studies have demonstrated that vascular calcification is a regulated process; and osteogenic differentiation and
calcification of VSMC contributes significantly to the development of vascular calcification. Calcium signaling is
critical in regulating VSMC function. However, the role of the key intracellular calcium signaling mediator,
phospholipase CÎ³ (PLCÎ³), in regulating VSMC calcification is entirely unknown. Our preliminary studies
demonstrated that deletion of PLCÎ³2 markedly increased calcification in VSMC and in atherosclerotic lesions
of ApoE-/- mice. Using VSMC from PLCÎ³2 deletion mice (PLCÎ³2-/-), we determined a direct effect of PLCÎ³2
deficiency on promoting VSMC calcification, which was independent of the PLCÎ³1 isoform or the known PLCÎ³-
mediated signaling pathways, supporting a unique and novel function of PLCÎ³2 in regulating VSMC
calcification. PLCÎ³2 deletion in VSMC altered cytoskeleton structure and increased secretion of matrix vesicles
(MVs), membrane-bound nanoparticles that harbor calcium and matrix proteins. MV secretion is a key cellular
event in osteogenesis that initiates extracellular matrix calcification during bone formation; and has recently
been shown to play an important role in vascular calcification. However, the molecular regulations of MV
secretion in VSMC are poorly understood. We found that restoring PLCÎ³2 normalized MV secretion and
inhibited calcification of the PLCÎ³2-/- VSMC. Furthermore, PLCÎ³2 interacted with membrane-associated
filamentous proteins, septin 4/5, which have been shown to dynamically interact with membrane phospholipids
and exocytosis machinery proteins that regulate cytoskeleton arrangement and synaptic vesicle secretion. The
roles of septins in VSMC MV secretion are unknown, our findings of PLCÎ³2/septin4/5 interactions and
increased septin 4/5 in MVs from PLCÎ³2-/- VSMC support a new role of septins in regulating VSMC MV
secretion and calcification. Therefore, we hypothesize that PLCÎ³2 deficiency induces VSMC calcification
via altered septin/actin-cytoskeleton structure that leads to increased MV secretion. With our new
mouse models, Aim 1 will determine the function of SMC-specific PLCÎ³2 in regulating vascular function in vivo;
and Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying PLCÎ³2-regulated VSMC calcification. These
studies will elucidate an integrative role of SMC-derived PLCÎ³2 in regulating cytoskeleton structure and MV
secretion that lead to VSMC calcification. PLCÎ³2 mutations in humans have recently been identified to cause
immunological diseases but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Therefore, delineating the
novel function and mechanisms whereby PLCÎ³2-regulated vascular function should provide novel insights into
the comprehensive function of PLCÎ³2 in health and disease beyond the vascular system.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This proposal will focus on elucidating novel mechanism regulating vascular smooth muscle cell calcification in
atherosclerosis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. We have discovered an
important new role of PLCÎ³2 in regulating calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells and in atherosclerosis
in mice, via a unique and novel mechanism that is independent of its homologue PLCÎ³1 or the known PLCÎ³-
mediated signaling pathways. Using novel tissue-specific PLCÎ³2 deletion mouse models, the proposed studies
will reveal a previously unknown PLCÎ³2-regulated novel signaling network in the vascular system, which should
have important clinical implications in designing effective therapy for vascular calcification and atherosclerosis.

 My major research interest is to understand molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and function in
the pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular disease, two major health burdens for our Veterans. We seek
to determine the fundamental molecular signals that regulate cellular function, and translate the findings in the
pathogenesis of disease using animal models, so as to identify novel molecular targets and strategies for
prevention and intervention of disease.
 Translational research on cancer pathogenesis and resistance to therapy. We have been
focused on the death receptor signaling pathways in regulating apoptosis of cancer cells and their roles in
cancer tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. Our studies have demonstrated that modulating the Death-
Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) determines the downstream survival and apoptosis signals. Recently, we
discovered a novel regulator, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), in the death receptor-5 DISC that
contribute to the resistance of pancreatic cancer to therapy, a critical hurdle for effective cancer treatment.
Based on this novel finding, our current VA merit review award (2014-2018) is to delineate the mechanisms
underlying DISC-associated PARP1 in regulating pancreatic cancer resistance to antibody immunotherapy with
a humanized anti-death receptor 5 antibody (TRA-8/CS1008). I will continue my long-term collaboration with
VA physician scientist, Jay M McDonald, MD (Pathology, Birmingham VA) and the inventor of TRA-8/CS1008,
Tong Zhou, MD (Medicine, UAB). As CS1008 therapy has been effective in clinical trials for some cancer but
resistant in others including pancreatic tumors, the overarching goal for our investigations is to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms and identify new compounds that sensitize pancreatic cancer to TRA-8-induced
apoptosis, thus overriding drug resistance and leading to successful therapies.
 Differentiation and reprogramming of vascular smooth muscle cells in vascular disease.
Phenotypic plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) provides an excellent model to study the
function of cell differentiation in health and disease. We are particularly interested in studying how VSMC
become bone-like cells (vascular calcification). Using tissue-specific gene knockout mouse models, we have
demonstrated an essential role of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 in regulating vascular calcification,
a feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes and end stage renal disease. We have uncovered novel mechanisms
underlying Runx2 upregulation in the vasculature by increased oxidative stress and hyperglycemia. We have
also discovered a novel crosstalk between VSMC, macrophages and vascular stem cells in the development of
atherosclerotic calcification. We have published a body of work demonstrating a critical integrative role of
Runx2 upregulation in VSMC in promoting vascular pathology, which has been highly recognized and cited.
Our overarching goals are to identify novel mechanisms that regulate pathogenesis of vascular calcification
and identify therapeutic targets. We have brought together several physician scientists at the Birmingham VA
including Drs. Paul Sanders and Anupam Agarwal (Nephrology) as well as Dr. Louis Dell'Italia (Cardiology and
Associate Chief of Staff). Our collaborative studies have led to the development of a Program Project to
investigate â€œNovel Regulators for Vascular Diseaseâ€, which have been supported by the VA (2012-2016).
 These investigations will not only elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of cancer drug resistance and pathogenesis of vascular disease, but also provide novel molecular
insights facilitating further studies to translate these findings into therapeutic strategies for patient care, so as
to improve the Veterans' health, life span and quality of life.","My major research interest is to understand molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and function in the

1R21AI139900-01A1,VPO1 Protects from Endotoxin-Mediated Inflammation and Septic Shock,"Project Summary
 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, is a component of Gram-negative
bacteriaâ€™s outer membrane. LPS induces an inflammatory response, severe endotoxin septic
shock. Sepsis poses a serious public health problem, with an overall mortality rate of 25-50%.
Vascular peroxidase-1 (VPO1), which is identified by the PIâ€™s group, is new member of animal
heme-containing peroxidase family. VPO1 is unique in the family. It possesses five leucine-rich
repeats and four immunoglobulin domains in addition to the peroxidase domain. VPO1 is highly
expressed in cardiovascular system and the lung, and is secreted into blood, which is
approximate 1000-fold higher than myeloperoxidase in plasma. VPO1 also exists in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at relatively higher concentration. Our data show that VPO1
specifically interacts with LPS via its LRRs and Ig domains. Interestingly, administration of LPS
or Gram-negative bacteria causes more severe inflammatory response in VPO1-deficient mice
than in wild-type mice. We hypothesize that VPO1 mediates resistance to LPS-mediated
inflammatory response and septic shock by inhibiting the interaction of LPS and TLR4/MD-
2/CD14 co-receptor. The specific aim of the proposal is to extensively evaluate VPO1 roles in
LPS-mediated inflammatory response and septic shock. The in vitro and in vivo methods
including using VPO1-deficient mice will be carried out. Identification and characterization of
VPO1 role in protection from systemic inflammatory response and endotoxin shock will advance
new knowledge of innate immunity and inflammatory responses, which will ultimately lead to the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for endotoxin shock.","RELEVANCE.

1R01AI141724-01,The Roles of LPS-Binding Protein Vascular Peroxidase-1 in Innate Immunity,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, affecting approximately 450 million people globally
per year, and results in about 4 million deaths annually. Although the need for research directed toward
development of new antibiotics is urgent, the need to study and better understand host immune responses has
never been greater.
 Our previous studies identified and characterized a new member of animal heme-containing peroxidase
(hPx) family, Vascular peroxidase 1 (VPO1). Like other members of the hPx family, VPO1 generates
hypohalous acids and is able to kill bacteria. Our data show that VPO1-deficient mice have decreased
survival in pneumonia. In addition to its catalytic domains, VPO1 has a unique N-terminus containing five
leucine-rich repeats and four immunoglobulin domains, which bind with high specificity to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), and kill gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, our data reveal that LPS causes stronger inflammatory
responses in VPO1-deficient mice; VPO1 can inhibit LPS-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor 4. These
results lead to our central hypothesis that VPO1 has a bifunctional role in innate immunity, both via bactericidal
activities and inhibition of LPS-mediated inflammatory responses. Guided by strong preliminary data, we
propose to pursue three Specific Aims: (1) define the molecular mechanisms of VPO1-mediated bactericidal
activities; (2) evaluate functional roles of VPO1 in regulation of LPS-mediated inflammatory responses; (3)
assess whether exogenous delivery of VPO1 restores host defense function in VPO1-deficient mice.
 Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by determining and characterizing a new
host defense enzyme, VPO1, with dual function in bacterial killing and reduction of LPS-stimulated
inflammation. These studies will uncover new molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction and
potentially provide a novel (beyond antibiotics) therapeutic strategy of immune-modulation to treat pneumonia
and endotoxin septic shock.","PROJECT NARRATIVE.

5K08DE027401-03,Nitric Oxide Releasing Biomimetic Nanomatrix Gel for Root Revitalization,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Dental pulp tissue exposed to a mechanical trauma or cariogenic process can result in root canal
and/or periapical infections, which can be treated via an endodontic procedure. A regenerative endodontic
procedure (REP) attempts to revitalize pulp-dentin tissue from a previously necrotic or inflamed pulp, thus,
allowing for continued development of the pulp-dentin structure, particularly for a young immature root.
However, the current REP has resulted in unfavorable outcomes, including tooth discoloration, cervical root
fractures, inadequate pulp-dentin tissue structure formation, and multiple clinic visits.
 In order to tackle the challenges of the current REP, a highly interdisciplinary and innovative strategy is
proposed for efficient root canal disinfection and pulp-dentin tissue revitalization using an antibiotics and nitric
oxide (NO) releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel. We hypothesize that the antibiotics and NO releasing
nanomatrix gel will demonstrate an efficient antibacterial effect and recruit endogenous stem cells to induce
pulp-dentin revitalization, while providing a favorable pulp-dentin tissue mimicking extracellular matrix
environment. The proposed strategy has several advantages over the current REP: 1) preventing tooth
discolorations by removal of minocycline, 2) preventing cervical root fractures by avoidance of calcium
hydroxide, 3) antibacterial effect of the NO, 4) sustained NO release from the nanomatrix gel by enzyme
mediated degradation, 5) reducing inflammatory responses by avoidance of reopening root canals and
stimulated bleeding, 6) biocompatibility and biodegradability of the nanomatrix gel as a functional extracellular
matrix, and 7) less extensive pulp access opening, clinical visits, and restorations with cost-effective materials
such as composites resin.
 Therefore, three specific aims are proposed to evaluate the hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate
the anti-biofilm effects of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel in clinical samples from
the endodontic infection. Specific Aim 2 is to evaluate the cellular effects of the antibiotics and NO releasing
biomimetic nanomatrix gel on dental pulp stem cells. Specific Aim 3 is to develop a beagle infected tooth
model and evaluate the revitalization capacity of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel.
The outcomes from this proposal will demonstrate the anti-biofilm effect and revitalization potential of the
antibiotics and NO releasing nanomatrix gel for the treatment of endodontic infections. Further, the outcomes
will also lead to future clinical studies for a young immature root as well as a mature root canal infection with
traumatic exposure and bacterial associated cases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Current root regeneration method using triple antibiotics, calcium hydroxide, and stimulated bleeding into the
root canal have shown unfavorable treatment outcomes including tooth discolorations, cervical fractures, and
inadequate pulp-dentin tissue repair. To reduce these unfavorable outcomes, an antibiotics and nitric oxide
releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel is proposed as an innovative treatment protocol providing an antibacterial
effect and inducing pulp-dentin tissue revitalization. The proposed treatment has the potential to benefit
general public health via reducing the number of clinic visits and decreasing the financial burden on patients by
negating the need for extensive restorations (i.e., crowns).",2019,132948,123100,9848,Other Research-Related,K08,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN,352940001,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human,Kyounga  Cheon

The clinical network will be facilitated by the Interventions & Translation Core, and the resource will be accessible
to all investigators in our DRC as well as others in our partnering centers and academic institutions. Other DRC
cores will be adapted to facilitate effective hypothesis testing using this resource.
 Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of an innovative lifestyle program (telehealth + community health
workers) with and without metformin for diabetes prevention. This pilot trial is intended to consolidate and
refine operations within the primary care coalition, and to develop data for a larger scale randomized trial
evaluating a novel and sustainable approach for diabetes prevention that involves an innovative lifestyle
intervention combined with metformin.
 The current revision application underscores the commitment of the DRC to partnerships and research that
is directed at improving health in patients with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease in our communities with a
particular emphasis on health disparities in rural communities. The primary care coalition is designed as a
powerful resource for the study of mechanisms responsible for chronic disease disparities and developing
interventions uniquely effective in these high-risk populations.","Diabetes is responsible for a huge and growing burden of patient suffering and social costs, and the impact
of this disease is shared disproportionately by minorities and in rural resource-challenged communities,
particularly in the Deep South. To address this problem, the UAB Diabetes Research Center will establish a
primary care clinical network in rural counties of Alabama and in the Mississippi delta that will provide the DRC
and its members with opportunities for partnership and the infrastructure to conduct translational and clinical
research in those patients with the greatest need. A pilot trial will be conducted within the coalition to assess
feasibility for a larger trial to evaluate a novel and sustainable approach for diabetes prevention that involves
an innovative lifestyle intervention combined with metformin.",2019,932545,648130,284415,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diabetes; Health Services; Prevention; Rural Health,Andrea L Cherrington
5UH3HL130691-05,Collaboration to Improve Blood Pressure in the US Black Belt- Addressing the Triple Threat,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (Provided By Applicant): The central objective of this proposal is to rigorously compare two strategies designed to improve blood pressure (BP) control in primary care practices serving rural Southeastern African Americans with low socioeconomic status living in the ""Black Belt"". The Black Belt is in the heart of the Stroke Belt, a geographic area long recognized to have the highest cardiovascular disease mortality in the US. We draw on the growing evidence that practice facilitation (PF), a highly customized, staged approach to helping practices to implement process and structural changes, can enhance the quality of care and improve patient and staff satisfaction, but there is less evidence on its ability to improve outcomes such as BP control. An alternate approach to improving CVD risk factors that is more relationship-focused and with growing evidence of effectiveness involves the use of peer coaches. We and others have shown that peer coaches are effective in Black Belt communities, where mistrust of the healthcare system is common. Using well-established community-based partnerships and the RE-AIM implementation framework, our UH2 Specific Aims are: 1. Engage rural primary care practices, hypertension (HTN) patients, peer coaches, and Community Advisory Boards in AL and NC to collaboratively finalize a PF intervention and a peer coaching intervention, both designed to improve BP in African Americans. 2. Create the data systems for the trial. Our UH3 Specific Aims are: 3. Enroll 80 practices and 25 African American patients with uncontrolled HTN at each practice (total n=2000) in a cluster-randomized, controlled pragmatic implementation trial to compare the two multi- component, multi-level interventions finalized in the UH2 phase with enhanced usual care using a 2 x 2 factorial design. We hypothesize that both interventions will improve BP more than enhanced usual care, and that both interventions delivered together will result in greater improvements in BP than either intervention alone. While we aim to control BP in 75% of participating intervention patients overall, the trial is designed to detect >15% difference in BP control (primary outcome) between the combined intervention and the enhanced usual care arms. Secondary outcomes will include group mean BP differences between baseline and follow- up; quality of life; patient satisfaction; healthcare utilization; and provider and staff satisfaction. The study is designed to examine differences by sex, age, depression, and health literacy/numeracy. Aim 4. Establish scalability of the intervention throughout the entire Black Belt region using extensive process data intended to facilitate future implementation, including practice characteristics, patient characteristics, intervention implementation variables and fidelity measures, as well as focus groups and interviews with patients, peer coaches, facilitators, practice staff, and clinicians. We have extensive experience with community-based peer coaching interventions; PF interventions; health disparities research in CVD; and large multi-site randomized controlled trials engaging real-world practices, assuring the success of the project.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke and heart disease, and affects African Americans more than others. African Americans who live in the rural impoverished ""Black Belt"" region of the Southeast are especially hard hit, facing substantial barriers to getting their high blood pressure treated. We will use a stakeholder engaged research approach to finalize two interventions during a planning year, then carry out a 2 x 2 factorial, cluster-randomized trial comparing the practice facilitation and peer coaching interventions to usual care. We will test whether these interventions, alone and in combination, can improve blood pressure, quality of life and satisfaction with care. The trial will enroll 80 primary care practices and a total of 2000 adult African American Black Belt residents with uncontrolled high blood pressure.

5R18DK109501-04,The Alabama Care Plan: Assessing the Impact of Regional Care Organizations on Diabetes Outcomes in a Sample of Alabama Medicaid Recipients,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Despite advances in the scientific knowledge related to diabetes prevention and management, diabetes prevalence, complications, and costs continues to rise. A majority of the dollars that go towards diabetes care are spent on Emergency Department visits, hospitalizations, and the management of diabetes complications. Changing the trajectory of the diabetes epidemic in the United States may require a fundamentally new approach to chronic disease management and reimbursement that emphasizes disease prevention and management. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) could be such an approach. Under this model, an organization is charged with the care of a population, receives a capitated payment and may be eligible for either a share of any savings achieved and/or at risk for a portion of any spending over the set target. As such, ACOs have been proposed as a means to simultaneously improve population health and reduce health care costs. The Alabama Medicaid program is undergoing a major transformation from a traditional fee for service model to the establishment of ACOs (referred to in Alabama as RCOs or Regional Care Organizations). The Alabama Care Plan, one of 6 probationary RCOs, will assume care for over 70,000 Medicaid recipients in Region B, 11% of whom have diabetes. In April 2015, VIVA Health, a local managed care organization and the lead entity in the Alabama Care Plan, began creating care coordination teams that will work with individuals' current health care providers to comprise a larger ""health home."" This phased transition provides a unique opportunity for us to assess the impact of policy change related to reimbursement and the delivery of health care as it relates to diabetes. With this proposal, investigators will conduct a
rigorous evaluation of the impact of this transition on outcomes in three dimensions: health of a population, experience of care, and per capita cost. The specific aims are: 1. To examine changes in diabetes related population health measures, including glycemic control (HbA1c) and indicators of diabetes care (quarterly HbA1c, annual eye exam); 2. To examine patient experience of care using a telephone-administered survey and qualitative interviews with a subset of individuals with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the Health Home; and 3.To examine changes in health care utilization and overall cost effectiveness of the newly implemented RCO and Health Home compared to diabetes care before RCO implementation. Using Medicaid data beginning in 2010 through 2019, investigators will conduct interrupted time series analyses of data from enrollees within Region B and difference-in- differences analyses to compare changes over time in Region B with changes over time in 3 southern, non- ACO states. The multidisciplinary team of investigators has expertise in diabetes research, use of CMS data, survey administration and qualitative methods. Alabama has the highest rate of diabetes in the United States. As such, this study could have important local and national policy implications for new approaches to diabetes management.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

5R01GM121449-03,The role of Orc6 in DNA replication and cytokinesis,"Abstract.
 The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), heteromeric six-subunit protein
complex, is essential for DNA replication. ORC's functions also extend beyond DNA
replication. We found that the smallest of ORC subunit, Orc6 protein, is important for
DNA binding and replication and has a structural homology with transcription factor
TFIIB suggesting that it may target the formation of pre-replicative complex to the
origins of DNA replication. Furthermore, we identified conserved motif within the C-
terminus of Orc6 which is responsible for its interaction with the core ORC complex.
Mutations in this motif affect the integrity of six-subunit ORC contributing to the
pathogenesis of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) in humans. Orc6 also has a function in
cytokinesis. It binds directly to septin complex via its Pnut subunit, stimulates the
intrinsic GTPase activity of the Drosophila septin complex and greatly facilitates septin
filament formation. The overall goal of our proposal is to characterize the mechanism
of Orc6 functions in DNA replication and cytokinesis using Drosophila as a model
system. Our experiments are designed to answer important questions about the
structure of Orc6, its functions in replication and its role in septin polymerization.
Drosophila model systems will be used to analyze the effects of naturally occurring
and structure-guided targeted mutations of human Orc6 in diverse protein functions.
Because ORC is conserved in evolution, what we learn about its functions in
Drosophila will be valuable to our understanding of ORC's functions in other
eukaryotes. A better understanding of how ORC functions in Drosophila will provide
insights into ORC's behavior in mammals and provide clues as to how its
misregulation leads to cancer.","Project narrative

1K08AI146220-01,Dysbiosis of the Sinus Microbiota in Chronic Rhinosinusitis,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic airway disease defined as persistent inflammation and infection of the
nasal and sinus mucosa. Mounting evidence suggests that a microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) is associated with
disease pathogenesis, yet the complex interaction between the sinus microbiota and host environment (including
dysfunctional mucociliary clearance (MCC)) is poorly understood. Additionally, it is unclear how the local milieu
created through ineffective mucus transport supports and sustains bacterial growth in vivo. The fundamental
hypothesis of this proposal is that CRS develops through a defined series of dependent events: 1) impaired
mucus clearance, 2) generation of dysbiosis (predominantly anaerobic bacterial growth), 3) mucin degradation
to carbon-source nutrients, and 4) proliferation of sinus pathogens. The following specific aims are proposed to
test this hypothesis:
(1) Evaluate the contribution of mucin-fermenting anaerobes to recalcitrant CRS progression. Our
 specific hypothesis is that abundance of carbon-source nutrients (generated from abundant
mucinfermenting anaerobes) in CRS patients with Pseudomonas correlates to markers of CRS severity.
(2) Determine the impact of the carbon-source nutrient (acetate) on the development of Pseudomonas
 sinusitis. Our specific hypothesis is that rabbits inoculated with wild type P. aeruginosa will demonstrate the
most severe sinusitis when acetate is available.
(3) Assess whether the transfer of healthy mucus with baseline mucin metabolites and commensal
 microbiota can reverse disease progression. Our specific hypothesis is that transfer of mucus
containing baseline SCFAs and healthy microbiota will restore sinus health and reverse rabbit sinusitis
disease progression.
Overall, we anticipate that this proposal will yield critical understanding of CRS pathogenesis and establish new
and important knowledge regarding anaerobic bacteria in disease progression. We believe the innovative rabbit
model of CRS created by our laboratory is ideally suited for the proposed pre-clinical studies and will unlock the
pathogenic mechanism leading to chronic inflammation and infection in CRS. Organisms typically defined as
commensals may contribute to airway disease by degrading mucins, in turn providing nutrients for pathogens
otherwise unable to obtain a carbon source for growth in the sinus. Targeting mucin-fermenting anaerobes and
their metabolites is a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CRS. Restoring the microbial community in
diseased sinuses by mucus transfer represents a highly valued, inexpensive and safe therapy for CRS. Such a
therapy could reduce antibiotic prescriptions and combat the rising incidence of antibiotic resistance.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:
CRS affects 1/8 of the adults in the U.S. population and is responsible for annual costs (direct and indirect) of
$22 billion comprising 5% of annual healthcare expenditures in the U.S. Patients with CRS have an abysmal
quality of life (QOL) and demonstrate worse scores for physical pain and social functioning (many missed work
days, need for repeat clinic visits, and continued trips to the operating room for sinus surgeries) than those
suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or angina. This proposal will yield
crucial understanding of CRS pathogenesis, establish new & important knowledge regarding anaerobes in
disease progression, and explore a novel therapeutic strategy that restores sinus health by targeting disrupted
microbiota with transfer of healthy mucus to infected sinus and nasal cavities.",2019,154044,142633,11411,Other Research-Related,K08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome,Do-Yeon  Cho
5P50AR060772-08,Project 2: Novel Risk Factors and Precision Medicine for Gout Flares,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Gout is a common and excruciatingly painful inflammatory arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. The 
prevalence of gout has increased over the past few decades to 3.9% of US adults (8.3 million individuals), 
which is further complicated by a high level of comorbidities (CoRT theme, including chronic kidney disease 
(CKD)) and their sequelae (e.g., premature death). Despite our understanding of gout's pathogenesis and 
available medications, gout management remains suboptimal with recurrent attacks occurring frequently, and 
there is a clear need to broaden the evidence-based and personalized precision approach to gout care. Our 
previous Boston Online Gout Study successfully provided the relevant evidence about the role of traditionally 
purported risk factors for gout flares in pre-existing gout patients, which was endorsed by the latest ACR gout 
guidelines. However, evidence for purported novel common modifiable risk factors as well as genetic and 
other key attributes, which are essential for precision gout care, are lacking. To fill this key evidence 
gap, we will expand our successful platform of the Boston Online Gout Study by following 800 gout patients 
from the Partners Biobank cohort (N >75,000) and 200 black gout patients from the UAB Rheumatology Arthritis 
Database and Registry over the course of 1 year. We will first examine novel common modifiable factors (i.e., 
sugar-sweetened beverages, coffee, and tea) for the risk of gout flares (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will translate 
recent genomic research data towards precision medicine in gout care for both lifestyle and 
pharmacologic interventions. Specifically, we will examine the purported influence of urate genes involved in 
sugar transport (SLC2A9) and metabolism genes (GCKR, IGF1R, and INHBB) on the impact of key risk factors 
for gout flares (Aim 2). We will also examine the purported impact of the ABCG2 variant (Q141K) and PRKAG2 
variant (which encodes the gamma chain of AMPK (a master regulator of gouty inflammation)) on allopurinol's 
clinical efficacy for gout flares, as well as the purported role of the SLC2A9 variant on diuretic-induced gout 
flares (Aim 3). Finally, we will examine the role of other key attributes (i.e., race (black) and CKD status 
(stage 3 or higher)) on the impact of key triggers of gout flares among gout patients to further precision gout care 
(Aim 4). These aims address novel, common risk factors, gene-environmental interactions, 
pharmacogenomics, and race/CKD impact, all of which can be readily translated into clinical practice to 
optimize gout care. Further, the innovative and cost-effective study design leverages our group's extensive 
gout research experience and provides key research translation for precision medicine in gout. This project 
will have an important positive impact on millions of gout patients by filling key evidence gaps on modifiable 
factors and relevant subgroups at risk for gout flares.",,2019,262546,256544,6002,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Arthritis; Clinical Research; Precision Medicine; Prevention,HYON K CHOI
1K23MD013903-01,Enhancing Health Literacy in Surgery (EHLIS) to Eliminate Surgical Disparities for African-Americans with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rationale: In the United States, over 3.1 million people suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which
includes Crohnâ€™s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Most patients will require major surgery in their lifetime. As the
incidence of IBD rises in racial/ethnic minority populations, surgical disparities are emerging with significantly
worse outcomes for African-Americans compared to whites. Recent data has suggested a potential role of health
literacy in determining surgical outcomes (and disparities), but, to our knowledge, no literacy-based interventions
in surgery exist. This project aims to address surgical disparities through the development of a health literate
surgical care program to eliminate disparities for African-Americans with IBD. These project goals would support
the core missions of the NIHMD and Healthy People 2020 in achieving health equity for all patients.
Objectives: My long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher focused on identifying,
understanding and eliminating surgical disparities. Through this career development award, my remaining gaps
in knowledge and skills will be filled through a personalized three-year training program that will include didactics
(for an MSPH), mini-sabbaticals and mentorship by an experienced mentor team. These plans will support my
research goals: (i) to identify factors that impact health literacy in current surgical care programs and (ii) to
develop a health literate and culturally-competent surgical care program through stakeholder engagement.
Design and Methods: Our study will use a mixed-method formative research approach with significant
stakeholder engagement. Guided by the Health Literacy and Outcomes Framework, we will first use qualitative
methods (key informant interviews/focus groups) to identify gaps in current surgical care that may impact an
African-American IBD patientâ€™s capacity to obtain, process and understand surgical information (Specific Aim
1a). We will then develop stakeholder-centered quantitative assessments to confirm the qualitative findings
(Specific Aim 1b). We will finally use an iterative multidimensional stakeholder engagement process to design a
health literate surgical care program (â€œEnhancing Health Literacy in Surgeryâ€ or EHLIS) (Specific Aim 2). We will
conduct this study at a high-volume, tertiary-care IBD center that serves a high-proportion of African-Americans
with IBD. The results of this study will provide the data for an R21 submission to examine EHLIS feasibility,
which, in turn, will inform a larger randomized trial (R01/PCORI).
Significance: In conjunction with my career development/training plans, this project will inform the development
of a health literate intervention focused on improving surgical outcomes and eliminating disparities in African-
American IBD patients undergoing major surgery. Lessons learned could have much broader implications in
other surgical populations as surgical disparities exist in all disciplines and innovative interventions are needed.","RELEVANCE
African-Americans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often faced with major surgery and represent a
growing population at high-risk for surgical disparities. The proposed research focuses on eliminating these
disparities by developing a surgical care program crafted with health literacy-based interventions. Successful
development of a health literate surgical care program has the potential to positively impact the African-American
IBD population and may offer a patient-centered approach to addressing surgical disparities in other vulnerable
surgical populations.",2019,152329,141460,10869,Other Research-Related,K23,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Crohn's Disease; Digestive Diseases; Health Services; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Patient Safety; Prevention,Daniel I Chu
5R01GM120211-03,Copper Transport by Members of the Mitochondrial Carrier Family,"Copper is a key element in the survival and normal development of humans but it is also toxic to cells
when mishandled. In fact even mild disruption of copper homeostasis causes a wide array of disorders
including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's
disease. The requirement for copper is in part due to its role as a cofactor in the terminal electron transport
chain complex cytochrome c oxidase. Though copper has an essential role in mitochondrial function, our
knowledge of how it is recruited to, and distributed within, the organelle is very limited. The hypothesis to be
tested here is that mitochondrial carrier family proteins that are used for translocation of substrates across the
inner membrane are critical to copper homeostasis. The proposed aims and experiments combine in vivo and
in vitro analysis of copper dependent phenotypes and transport assays to establish a role for a mitochondrial
carrier family protein in copper transport. We will demonstrate the copper transport function of this protein in
cell culture and an animal model by assessing the abundance and activity of copper-dependent enzymes, total
copper in mitochondria and total copper in whole cells. Data generated from the experiments proposed in
these aims will result in significant advances in our understanding of mitochondrial copper homeostasis in
humans. The impact of this proposal is that knowledge gained by identifying a mitochondrial copper transporter
can contribute to our understanding basic biology but also to a wide spectrum of diseases caused by copper
mishandling or mitochondrial dysfunction. Many of these diseases are currently untreatable and this proposal
will provide a potential druggable target for therapeutic intervention.","Mitochondrial respiratory chain defects account for the majority of fatal genetic diseases of metabolism. However, we cannot determine the cause of some of these disorders because we lack a complete understanding of the respiratory chain enzyme assembly process. One important step in respiratory chain assembly is the insertion of cofactors required for the function of these enzymes. In particular, the means by which copper, a cofactor required by the final enzyme complex in the respiratory chain, is imported into mitochondria is not known. This project aims to characterize the copper transport pathway in mitochondria that will serve as a potential target for diagnosis and therapy of copper related diseases.",2019,258846,197428,61418,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,368325888,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Neurosciences,Paul A Cobine; Scot  Leary
7R15HD096456-02,Role of Syntax in Reading Comprehension in Down Syndrome,"Abstract
Down syndrome (DS) is the leading cause of intellectual disability and, among other things, it affects cognition,
learning, and adaptive skills. In spite of many significant challenges, most people with DS wish to learn the
skills that will enable the greatest independence possible in their adult lives (Wehmeyer & Metzler, 1995). One
of the greatest barriers to independence for youth with DS is limited reading skills. Although children with DS
can learn to read words, their progress typically stalls at the early grade level when the emphasis on reading
comprehension increases. Their reading skills may never transition from â€œlearning to read to reading to learnâ€
(Chall, 1967). It is well known that DS is associated with a cognitive-linguistic phenotype of strengths and
weaknesses. Several aspects of this phenotype are directly relevant to reading development, and thus reading
development might be atypical in this population (e.g., strengths in visual memory and vocabulary; weakness
in syntax). The proposed study has two aims â€“ Aim 1 is to determine the key components of reading
comprehension in DS, following the Simple View of Reading model. Based on a sample of 70 children with DS
ages 10-15, the proposed study will determine whether the two major components of reading comprehension â€“
word identification and language comprehension â€“ both contribute independently to reading comprehension.
The proposed study will go on to test an Extended Simple View which adds three cognitive measures as
potential additional components â€“ verbal working memory, attentional control, and processing speed. Finally,
the proposed study will examine components of word identification (phonological decoding and orthographic
processing) and language comprehension (vocabulary and syntax). Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that poor
syntax is a key limiting factor in the difficult transition to reading comprehension for children with DS. For this,
40 of the 70 children with DS from Aim 1 (ages 10-15) will be matched with 40 children with non-DS intellectual
disability (ID, ages 10-15; oversampling n = 50 to achieve n = 40 of matched participants) and 40 typically
developing children (ages 6-10; oversampling n = 50 to achieve n = 40 of matched participants) on word
identification ability. It is hypothesized that reading comprehension, along with language comprehension and
syntax, will be especially low in the group with DS and that, among several candidates, syntax will be the
strongest mediator of the relation between group and reading comprehension. Thus, the proposed study will
provide a descriptive breakdown of component (and subcomponent) skills of reading comprehension in DS and
identify the skills (e.g., syntax) that most limit the growth of reading comprehension in DS. Findings from the
study will be helpful in identifying targets for reading intervention for students with DS.","Project Narrative
Reading comprehension is a highly important independent living skill for individuals with Down syndrome, the
most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual disability. The proposed project will evaluate reading
comprehension and its linguistic and cognitive predictors, with a special focus on syntax, for individuals with
Down syndrome in comparison to groups with non-Down syndrome intellectual disability and typical
development. The goal is to identify both possible barriers (e.g., syntax) and possible pathways to reading
comprehension success; this is a critical first step to developing effective intervention and training in reading
for this population.",2019,393905,301857,92048,Non-SBIR/STTR,R15,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,AL,TUSCALOOSA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,354870104,,FRANCES A CONNERS

Abstract 
 The major thrust of the proposals made in this application is to investigate and hopefully 
resolve the remaining problems associated with the inflammatory and immune responses and 
coagulation dysregulation following organ xenotransplantation in pig-to-primate models. The 
Administrative Core (Core B) will support the goals of this Program, and of the Consortium, by:- 
 1) Facilitation and coordination of communication: 
Core B will coordinate close communication among the Project and Core PI's themselves, between 
them and the members of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), and with other members of this RFA- 
supported NIAID Consortium. Frequent communication, primarily in the form of conference calls, will 
be required between members of the Program, between Project and Core PI's and Consultants, and 
within the NIAID Consortium. 
 2) Logistical support: 
The Core will help with travel arrangements and hotel accommodation for Consultants and SAB 
members visiting Pittsburgh, Baltimore, or Blacksburg, and to attend workshops. Travel and hotels 
for the members of the Program who will be participating in the annual NIAID Consortium meeting 
will be supported through this mechanism. The inflammation, immunologic, and coagulation assays 
to be used in the studies in Projects 1 and 2 will be standardized between the centers (and, to the 
extent possible, across the NIAID Consortium) and the Core will facilitate exchange of samples, 
tissues, and reagents as well as protocols and expertise. Data from the various experiments and 
assays will be collected and collated in the Administrative Core. The Core will also be responsible for 
assisting with the preparation of manuscripts reporting the scientific work to be submitted for 
publication. 
 3) Financial administration: 
The Core will disburse and account for funds allocated. (NB. No funding from the grant will be 
allocated to the team from the NHLBI who will be members of our Consortium. Their travel expenses, 
etc., will be funded from other sources.) 
 4) Implementation of data sharing plan: 
Core B will assure that NIH data sharing requirements are fully satisfied by all Program investigators.

3U19AI090959-11S1,Genetically-engineered Pig Organ Transplantation into Non-human Primates,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of clinical transplantation is one of modern medicine's hallmark achievements. Unfortunately, a severe shortage of human organs, cells, and tissues constrains application of this life-saving technology. This RFA recognizes the potential for transplants from another species to humans (xenotransplantation) to fulfill the fields potential. For scientific and ethical reasons, a consensus has formed around discerning how to safely use pig organs for this purpose.  Clinical application of pig-to-human xenografts is currently prevented by vigorous immunologic barriers. Major progress has been made over the past two decades to understand and overcome these barriers, with key contributions over the past 9 years from our Program and other NIAID Consortium members. Most importantly, our Program has produced pigs that express a large number of human proteins that each protects the pig organ from injury by the primate immune response. The lung xeno model has been particularly useful to demonstrate the value of each of these modifications, and to identify remaining problems. With a combination of three to six gene modifications to the pig, and a carefully tailored drug treatment regimen to the recipient, current results have advanced from minutes to hours (lung) or days (liver), with more significant progress for kidneys (from weeks to months) and hearts, where survivals past one and even two years have recently been accomplished by members of our consortium.  Our proposals in response to the current RFA concentrate attention largely on the residual problem of the inflammatory response to pig organs. We shall explore methods of preventing or suppressing this response through either novel pig genetics or pharmacologic interventions. We will investigate transplantation of organs from these novel pigs, modifications to our already successful immunosuppressive regimen (in an effort to minimize infectious complications), and several anti-inflammatory agents that might allow consistent long-term (>6 months) pig kidney and heart graft survival, while significantly extending survival of livers and lungs. These studies will be carried out in our established kidney
(Pittsburgh), heart (NHLBI), liver and lung (Maryland) models, with all of which we have many years' experience and expertise. The outcomes of our studies will be comprehensively evaluated by numerous laboratory assays, with all of which we have experience at one or more of our participating centers.

Abstract 
 The major thrust of the proposals made in this application is to investigate and hopefully 
resolve the remaining problems associated with the inflammatory and immune responses and 
coagulation dysregulation following organ xenotransplantation in pig-to-primate models. The 
Administrative Core (Core B) will support the goals of this Program, and of the Consortium, by:- 
 1) Facilitation and coordination of communication: 
Core B will coordinate close communication among the Project and Core PI's themselves, between 
them and the members of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), and with other members of this RFA- 
supported NIAID Consortium. Frequent communication, primarily in the form of conference calls, will 
be required between members of the Program, between Project and Core PI's and Consultants, and 
within the NIAID Consortium. 
 2) Logistical support: 
The Core will help with travel arrangements and hotel accommodation for Consultants and SAB 
members visiting Pittsburgh, Baltimore, or Blacksburg, and to attend workshops. Travel and hotels 
for the members of the Program who will be participating in the annual NIAID Consortium meeting 
will be supported through this mechanism. The inflammation, immunologic, and coagulation assays 
to be used in the studies in Projects 1 and 2 will be standardized between the centers (and, to the 
extent possible, across the NIAID Consortium) and the Core will facilitate exchange of samples, 
tissues, and reagents as well as protocols and expertise. Data from the various experiments and 
assays will be collected and collated in the Administrative Core. The Core will also be responsible for 
assisting with the preparation of manuscripts reporting the scientific work to be submitted for 
publication. 
 3) Financial administration: 
The Core will disburse and account for funds allocated. (NB. No funding from the grant will be 
allocated to the team from the NHLBI who will be members of our Consortium. Their travel expenses, 
etc., will be funded from other sources.) 
 4) Implementation of data sharing plan: 
Core B will assure that NIH data sharing requirements are fully satisfied by all Program investigators.

5U19AI090959-11,Genetically-engineered Pig Organ Transplantation into Non-human Primates,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of clinical transplantation is one of modern medicine's hallmark achievements. Unfortunately, a severe shortage of human organs, cells, and tissues constrains application of this life-saving technology. This RFA recognizes the potential for transplants from another species to humans (xenotransplantation) to fulfill the fields potential. For scientific and ethical reasons, a consensus has formed around discerning how to safely use pig organs for this purpose.  Clinical application of pig-to-human xenografts is currently prevented by vigorous immunologic barriers. Major progress has been made over the past two decades to understand and overcome these barriers, with key contributions over the past 9 years from our Program and other NIAID Consortium members. Most importantly, our Program has produced pigs that express a large number of human proteins that each protects the pig organ from injury by the primate immune response. The lung xeno model has been particularly useful to demonstrate the value of each of these modifications, and to identify remaining problems. With a combination of three to six gene modifications to the pig, and a carefully tailored drug treatment regimen to the recipient, current results have advanced from minutes to hours (lung) or days (liver), with more significant progress for kidneys (from weeks to months) and hearts, where survivals past one and even two years have recently been accomplished by members of our consortium.  Our proposals in response to the current RFA concentrate attention largely on the residual problem of the inflammatory response to pig organs. We shall explore methods of preventing or suppressing this response through either novel pig genetics or pharmacologic interventions. We will investigate transplantation of organs from these novel pigs, modifications to our already successful immunosuppressive regimen (in an effort to minimize infectious complications), and several anti-inflammatory agents that might allow consistent long-term (>6 months) pig kidney and heart graft survival, while significantly extending survival of livers and lungs. These studies will be carried out in our established kidney
(Pittsburgh), heart (NHLBI), liver and lung (Maryland) models, with all of which we have many years' experience and expertise. The outcomes of our studies will be comprehensively evaluated by numerous laboratory assays, with all of which we have experience at one or more of our participating centers. We hypothesize that, within the 5-year funding period, this will enable consideration to be given to clinical trials of pig kidney, heart, and liver transplantation and will improve lung survival markedly.

The goal of this proposal is to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to diagnose ill neonates of diverse
backgrounds in the Deep South, to increase patient and provider familiarity with genomic testing, and to
provide and evaluate resources to facilitate the expanded utilization of clinical genomic testing. This project
will be a collaboration between genomic researchers and educators at the HudsonAlpha Institute for
Biotechnology, clinicians and outcomes experts at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, clinicians at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center and Druid City Hospital, and investigators at the University of
Louisville interested in the ethical, legal, and social consequences of returning genetic results. 2,000 infants
with signs suggestive of a genetic disorder being treated at a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in which
African-American and rural populations are highly represented will be enrolled. WGS will be used to identify
pathogenic variation in DNA from these infants. Stakeholders, including parents, clinicians, and community
leaders, will be engaged to develop culturally adapted educational materials and to equip non-genetics
providers to return WGS results. Parents will be provided with these materials through a web portal, the
Genome Gateway, and will be placed into one of two arms of a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness
technology-assisted WGS result delivery by non-genetics providers relative to result delivery from genetic
counselors. A health care cost analysis will be conducted to compare children who received WGS relative to
comparator children who did not. The final aim will serve to disseminate study findings and gather feedback
from key stakeholders to promote uptake and broader access to clinical sequencing technologies. This study
will address discrepancies in participation in genomic research by diverse racial/ethnic groups and the need for
educational support to facilitate progress towards safer, more effective, and more equitably distributed genomic
medicine.

5R01NS101958-04,Transcriptional regulation of metabolism in neurons,"Epidemiological, genetic, and biological evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of
Parkinson Disease (PD). Recent transcriptional studies have identified clusters of genes reduced in
dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of patients with subclinical and symptomatic PD, the majority of
which are involved in neuronal metabolism and mitochondrial function. These findings raise the possibility that
the function of transcriptional regulators of metabolic and mitochondrial genes may be compromised in
idiopathic PD and that targeting key transcriptional pathways for gene regulation may be an appropriate
strategy for preventing and/or rescuing metabolic deficits and neuronal cell death.
 Using bioinformatics and transcriptional assays, we have identified a potential transcription factor required for
the regulation of metabolic and nuclear-encoded gene transcription in dopaminergic nigral neurons. This
protein, estrogen-related receptor Î³ (ERRÎ³), drives the expression of nuclear-encoded genes for mitochondrial
biogenesis and respiration in peripheral tissues, and it can directly associate with peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1Î± (PGC-1Î±), a transcriptional coactivator that is reduced in PD and can be
neuroprotective when overexpressed in PD models. Our preliminary data indicate that ERRÎ³ is expressed by
neurons of the substantia nigra in rodents and that deletion of ERRÎ³ from the mouse midbrain causes a
reduction in ERRÎ³-driven metabolic genes and motor activity. Furthermore, our data indicate that PGC-1Î±-
target genes are enriched in binding sites for ERRÎ³ and that PGC-1Î± and ERRÎ³ can synergistically drive
mitochondrial gene expression. Importantly, the majority of mitochondrial genes of the electron transport chain
reduced in PD are ERRÎ³ target genes. The experiments proposed in this application will expand upon these
initial findings to test the hypotheses that ERRÎ³ is a central regulator of metabolic and mitochondrial gene
expression in nigral neurons (Aim 1), that ERRÎ³ is required for PGC-1Î± to induce metabolic and mitochondrial
genes (Aim 2), and that overexpression of ERRÎ³ can prevent cell dysfunction and death in rodent model of PD
(Aim 3). These experiments have the potential to reveal the critical pathways by which nigral neurons maintain
metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis and a novel avenue for improving mitochondrial function in disease.
Furthermore, considering that ERRÎ³ can orchestrate a transcriptional program for a number of genes reduced
in PD, ERRÎ³ deletion in nigral neurons could serve as a biologically relevant model of idiopathic PD.","Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature of neurodegenerative disorders. This proposal aims to elucidate

5F99NS108458-02,Role of alpha synuclein in PINK1-linked Parkinson's disease,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mutations in the PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) gene cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD).
The main pathological hallmarks of PD are loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta,
which are required for normal movement, and the formation of Î±-synuclein rich aggregates termed Lewy body
inclusions. Preliminary data from our lab and published reports on PINK1 knockout (KO) rats have demonstrated
that the rats have mitochondrial dysfunction, locomotor deficits, loss of neurons in the substantia nigra and locus
coeruleus, and Î±-synuclein aggregates in different brain regions including the substantia nigra, striatum, and
cortex. PINK1 is a mitochondrial targeted kinase involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria. In neurons,
mitochondria are predominantly located in the pre-synaptic terminal, where they provide the energy needed for
vesicle movement and synaptic transmission. Î±- Synuclein is also predominantly localized to the pre-synaptic
terminal where it has reported functions in movement of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool to the readily
releasable pool. Given the importance of both mitochondria and Î±-synuclein to synaptic transmission, and the
effect of PINK1 deficiency on mitochondrial health and Î±-synuclein accumulation, it remains to be determined
whether PINK1 KO rats have deficits in synaptic transmission. It is also unknown whether Î±-synuclein pathology
is simply an end byproduct of the accumulation of damaged mitochondria or, whether it directly contributes to
the observed pathological processes in PINK1 KO rats. Our preliminary findings, as well as published reports,
have led us to the hypothesis that PINK1 deficiency leads to Î±-synuclein aggregation, which causes a cascade
of synaptic dysfunction, locomotor abnormalities, and dopaminergic neuron loss. To determine Î±-synuclein's role
in the pathophysiology of PINK1 KO rats, we will utilize a combination of electrophysiological, histological,
biochemical and behavioral analyses. The results will indicate whether Î±-synuclein aggregation itself drives the
observed pathology, providing an answer to the importance of targeting Î±-synuclein interventions to halt or slow
PD progression.","Project Narrative
Parkinson's disease (PD), is caused by unknown factors or by mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial
biology and, there is no cure or treatment that slow or halts disease progression. We propose to examine the
importance of Î±-synuclein in the pathophysiology of PD and to determine whether targeting Î±-synuclein
interventions will alleviate locomotor, neurodegenerative, and synaptic dysfunction. Î±- Synuclein pathology is
one of the main pathological hallmarks of PD and understanding the mechanism by which its dysfunction leads
to PD may be critical to understanding and treating PD.",2019,37235,37235,,Other Research-Related,F99,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Rose Berthe Creed
5R01DA044112-02,Effectiveness of a smoking cessation algorithm integrated into HIV primary care,"Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the United States. Whereas smoking
has declined significantly among individuals in the general population, it is clustered in populations of
vulnerable individuals such as people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in whom smoking prevalence rates and
resulting comorbidity rates remain high. Medical advances in the treatment of HIV have resulted in substantial
increases in life expectancy among PLWH and as a consequence PLWH smokers are now, more than ever, at
heightened risk for tobacco-related illnesses and death. In fact, PLWH smokers engaged in treatment lose
more years of life due to smoking now than to HIV disease. Although PLWH smokers engaged in HIV care
typically see a medical provider every 4-6 months, smoking cessation treatment and referral is often not part of
routine HIV care. While 94% of HIV treatment providers indicated that they would be willing to provide smoking
cessation services to their patients, few have received training in how to provide smoking cessation services.
With seven first line pharmacotherapies available for smoking cessation, development of algorithms to assist
providers in selecting the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is an important but untested strategy to increase
smoking cessation in PLWH. Our pilot work has provided initial support for this approach and our intervention
has resulted in increased abstinence, higher use of pharmacotherapy, increased 24-hour quit attempts, and
enhanced in motivation to quit, compared to those receiving standard of care. The purpose of this proposal is
to conduct a mixed efficacy/effectiveness trial comparing an algorithm treatment with prescription cost off sets
and quit line referral (AT) to an enhanced Treatment as Usual (quit line referral only; eTAU) group. Six hundred
PLWH smokers will be recruited at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Washington, and
Fenway Health HIV clinics and will be randomized to receive AT or eTAU. All AT smokers will receive active
treatment for twelve weeks regardless of stated motivation or intention to quit. eTAU smokers will be referred
to quit line services and HIV providers may elect to treat smoking as part of standard of care. Participants will
remain in the study for 12 months. The primary outcome will be point prevalence smoking abstinence at 6
months. Other smoking-related outcomes of interest include 24-hour quit attempts and reduction in cigarettes
smoked per day. Effectiveness outcomes of interest include cost effectiveness analyses, number of smoking
pharmacotherapy prescriptions written, and change in provider knowledge and confidence to treat smoking. If
successful, this algorithm could provide an important tool that could be easily sustained and available for use
through the electronic medical record or transferred to a mobile device to aid health care professionals in
providing smoking cessation treatment to PLWH smokers.","Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is particularly concentrated among
disadvantaged populations such as PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the
treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in

5R01DA039678-04,In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is now concentrated in high risk and disadvantaged populations such as individuals in the criminal justice system.

5R34DA043346-03,NRT sampling and selection to Increase Medication Adherence,"Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of
every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 16.8% among the general population, smoking
rates remain disproportionately high among low income smokers (40.9% among individuals without a high
school diploma in Alabama). Despite high rates of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this
population. While medication adherence for smoking cessation is generally poor, nonadherence is particularly
high among low income populations. Misperceptions about the safety and efficacy of NRT appear to
undermine effective use of these medications, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Developing
interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing
disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been
psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our work with low income
populations demonstrates that smokers who have previous experience using bupropion have higher
subsequent cessation rates, and this relationship may be mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus,
exposure to medication may be a critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application
proposes a pilot trial (N=80) to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an in
vivo NRT experiential intervention (In vivo). Participants randomized to the In vivo condition will sample four
different short-acting NRT products (gum, lozenge, nasal spray, inhaler, counterbalanced within participant
across sessions) in combination with nicotine patch in session. During each 30-minute session, they will
discuss their expectancies and in vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology,
including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given acute NRT along with patch to use
during that week to practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. At the end of four weeks
of product sampling, participants will select their preferred combination to use over the next eight weeks for
smoking cessation. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of
standard smoking cessation behavioral counseling following best treatment guidelines. Control participants will
select an acute NRT to use with the nicotine patch based on a written description of each NRT product to use
for cessation attempts for 8 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to one month after NRT completion. Primary
outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of this novel intervention as well as medication adherence.
Secondary outcomes include examination of process measures believed to be associated with medication
adherence including nicotine dependence, withdrawal, craving, abstinence self-efficacy, motivation and NRT-
related expectancies. If promising, this pilot would provide preliminary support for a novel approach to increase

5U01AA020802-09,3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV â€“ Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),"Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the
US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral
alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite
the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular
contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are
delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding
period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and
conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from
routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy,
despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of
pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different
disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other
disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking
with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an
implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate
alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm
that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to
comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network
of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and
frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider,
staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care.
Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs
among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model
of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics.","Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice
as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic

1R01AG064769-01,Aging in Puerto Rico: Longitudinal Follow-Up of the PREHCO Study,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the past decade, Puerto Rico has experienced rapid population aging, financial collapse, mass outward
migration of younger people, and then Hurricane Maria. Now is an ideal time to build on the only population-
based cohort of older adults in Puerto Rico, unique in having data on health and function prior to these major
events. Households across Puerto Rico were visited to identify the first island-wide sample of adults age 60+
years for the Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions (PREHCO) study. A wide range of measures relevant to
health and aging, including in-home testing of cognitive and physical function, was collected at baseline
(2002/2003) and four years later (2006/2007). We propose to gather two new waves of data related to aging,
stress and health in a sample of approximately 1,000 PREHCO survivors. The current project will a) extend
PREHCO follow-up to between 16 and 20 years after baseline; b) examine life course predictors of major aging
outcomes, namely cognitive impairment, disability, and mortality; c) collect data on hurricane-related stressors
and mental health; d) add hair cortisol as a marker of chronic hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis
activation; and e) add cognitive and proxy informant measures that align with the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). Our project will enable the following specific aims: Aim 1. Examine longitudinal life course
biopsychosocial predictors of cognitive health, cortisol levels, mental health, disability, and mortality 16-20
years after baseline. Aim 2. Examine cross-sectional associations between stressors, resilience-enhancing
factors, perceived stress, cortisol, and health, as well as changes in health two years later. Aim 3. Increase
utility of PREHCO for cross-cultural comparisons. Puerto Rico is an important part of the U.S. that has largely
been omitted from U.S. population-based studies of aging. PREHCO participants are now age 76+ years and
given accelerating mortality rates for this age group, our proposal to gather two new time points of follow-up
data for PREHCO represents a time-limited opportunity to add to our knowledge about aging, stress, and
health in an understudied and potentially vulnerable population.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5P30AG031054-12,Community Liaison and Recruitment Core,"Project Summary/Abstract â€“ Community Liaison and Recruitment Core
The Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) is a collaborative of four unique
Southern institutions with complementary strengths: The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse
School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The University of Alabama. The primary objectives of the
Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC) are to (1) educate, train, and mentor Scientists in theory-
based approaches to engaging older African Americans (AAs) in health-related research, (2) assist RCMAR
Scientists in recruiting older AAs into their research studies, and (3) build a sustainable infrastructure that will
generate and disseminate new knowledge regarding the science of recruitment and retention. Our approach to
recruitment and retention draws upon research that addresses the role of culture in promoting health among
older AAs. Older AAs rely, to a greater extent, on their minority segregated communities, their cultural values,
and their kinship systems to receive health information. In addition to family and extended kinship networks,
older AAs place high value on their religious beliefs and practices. Because of this, recruitment and retention
endeavors should reflect this rich cultural fabric and employ strategies that are theory-based and culturally
relevant. In this application, we build upon our existing rural and urban community-based infrastructure that
has fostered community capacity for active engagement in clinical research and has served as a catalyst to
increase participation of older AAs in health-related research studies. We envision continued mutually
beneficial engagement, fostering opportunities both for the CLRC and RCMAR Scientists to solicit community
input on the development of potential research questions and for community members to enjoy enhanced
access to state-of-the-art clinical research focused on older AAs. To accomplish these broader goals, we
propose the following specific aims for the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core of the Deep South
RCMAR: (1) Work collaboratively with the Research Education Component (REC) to educate, train, and
mentor RCMAR Scientists regarding the theory and approach to community engagement and assist RCMAR
Scientists in recruiting older AAs to their research studies; (2) Advance scientific knowledge in the area of
recruitment and retention of older urban and rural AAs by empirically testing recruitment and retention
strategies developed in partnership with community members; (3) Expand capacity for community-academic
partnerships to support the recruitment and retention of older urban and rural AAs; and (4) Disseminate
research findings to the scientific community and the communities we serve. Through the activities of the
CLRC, we expect that RCMAR Scientists will continue to have access to evidence-based recruitment and
retention tools for both urban and rural older AAs, and realize enhanced participation of older AAs, greater
community â€œbuy-inâ€ to research projects, and clearer routes of dissemination and intervention sustainability.",,2019,19737,13291,6446,Research Centers,P30,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Rural Health,MARTHA R CROWTHER
5R01EY027948-03,A hyperspectral approach to RPE fluorophores in AMD,"Abstract
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes vision loss in millions worldwide. Central to AMD initiation
and progression is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is clinically visualized via the massed
autofluorescence (AF) of its lipofuscin and melanolipofuscin granules. We hypothesize, based on our imaging
and pathology studies, that AMD can be staged and monitored by the expression and distribution of unique
RPE fluorophores. We identified and characterized ex vivo spectral signatures of distinct fluorophore families
in normal RPE, Bruch's membrane and drusen, AMD's hallmark lesion. However, the molecular sources of
these spectra in the macula are now uncertain due to seminal imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) studies
showing that a major lipofuscin fluorophore, A2E, is abundant in the periphery. Thus, the long-term goal of
this 6-investigator collaboration is to develop AMD diagnostics based on hyperspectral AF for spectral,
molecular biopsy of the RPE, linking clinical pathology to underlying molecular composition. Hyperspectral
AF imaging, unlike conventional AF imaging, acquires 3-dimensional â€œhypercubesâ€ of data (2 spatial
coordinates â€“ x, y - and 1 spectral - wavelength). We explored imaging data with novel tensor-based tools
exploiting multiple excitation wavelengths to discover RPE spectral signatures and their spatial distributions.
We propose to link fluorophores to granules, RPE cells, tissue, and AMD stages in 3 aims using a common
human tissue source. Aim 1 uses hyperspectral AF tissue mapping to understand AMD pathology at the
spectral level in eyes with AMD and unaffected control eyes. We will map RPE flat-mounts by hyperspectral
AF microscopy linked to a pathology grading system. Spectral AF components will be recovered
mathematically and assigned to subcellular and extracellular features. Aim 2 will quantify AMD pathology at
the subcellular level by enumerating fluorophore-containing granules using structured illumination microscopy
and 3-dimensional electron microscopy. Aim 3 uses hyperspectral fluorophore identification to understand
AMD pathology at the molecular level. We will determine candidate molecules for the major spectral
components discovered in Aim 1 by hyperspectral thin layer chromatography and will verify their spatial
distributions by IMS. Synthetic authentic standards will ensure spectral validation. Biological validation at this
level is unprecedented for clinical ophthalmology, yet warranted by the size of the AMD patient population,
the enormity of knowledge gap about major RPE fluorophores in human eyes, the availability of donor tissue,
and the proven success of validating other imaging technologies. Our results will directly translate to clinical
hyperspectral AF imaging for noninvasive, spatially precise early detection and longitudinal AMD follow-up, in
vivo target discovery, and immediate extensions beyond AMD. From our discoveries will flow a huge range of
experiments in outer retinal cell biology to deepen understanding of retinal degenerations.","Narrative
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes vision loss in millions worldwide, and central to AMD
initiation and progression is the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We will use the strong autofluorescence of
the RPE as a probe for deeper understanding of AMD by harnessing hyperspectral autofluorescence,
ultrastructural pathology, image analysis, and imaging mass spectroscopy for molecular discovery. This holds
the promise of unlocking AMD mechanisms at the subcellular and molecular level, guiding new clinical
devices, identifying new therapeutic targets, and opening new areas of outer retinal biology.

5UM1AR065705-05,Safety and Effectiveness of Live Zoster Vaccine in Anti-TNF Users (VERVE Trial),"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes zoster (HZ), or ""shingles"", is caused by reactivation of the ubiquitous varicella zoster virus (VZV) that remains latent in sensory neurons following childhood varicella infection (""chickenpox""). It is estimated that one-third of individuas will develop HZ in their lifetime, and that >20% of individuals affected by zoster experience significant morbidity and occasionally mortality. The most common complication is post-herpetic neuralgia, resulting in chronic and sometimes debilitating pain. Other serious complications are rare but devastating, including encephalitis, blindness, loss of hearing and death. HZ risk is elevated by various states of immunosuppression including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where the risk is approximately double that of the general population. Given the increased HZ disease burden in RA, and the large numbers of RA patients within the US population, prevention of HZ in this setting has major potential public health impact. Currently, a live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax(r)) is available that reduces HZ morbidity by nearly 70%, yet to date, few RA patients have received this vaccine; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) consider the live zoster vaccine contraindicated in patients receiving some immunosuppressive medications such as biologic therapies. This contraindication stems from the theoretical concern that these individuals could develop local or disseminated varicella infection from the vaccine-strain virus. However, there are no published data to suggest that these safety concerns are warranted, and a growing body of observational data suggest that vaccinating such patients might be safe. In light of 1) a substantial elevated HZ risk among RA patients; 2) national data showing most RA patients are not vaccinated for HZ; and 3) the high effectiveness and safety of this vaccine in the general population, we propose to conduct the Varicella zostER VaccinE (VERVE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled large pragmatic trial to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and longer-term effectiveness of the live HZ vaccine in arthritis patients receiving anti-TNF therapy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this trial are expected to change clinical practice by demonstrating both short and longer-term effectiveness, as well as safety and tolerability, of the live zoster vaccine among current anti-TNF users. Rheumatologists and other providers will be able to improve the care, outcomes, and quality of life for patients on these biologies, substantially decreasing the morbidity of herpes zoster and its complications over a lifetime.",2019,654455,553256,164063,Non-SBIR/STTR,UM1,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Arthritis; Autoimmune Disease; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Pain Research; Prevention; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Vaccine Related,JEFFREY R.

5U01HL119242-05,Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP): Data Coordinating Center,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) project is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment of mild chronic hypertension (CHTN) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, CHTN is the most common major medical disorder, most often mild (BP <160/110 mmHg), and is associated with a 3-5 fold increase in adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, perinatal death, preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birth weight <10th percentile). Whereas antihypertensive therapy is a public health priority for the general population, authorities, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend against BP lowering therapy during pregnancy unless hypertension is severe, i.e., e160/110 mm Hg, because of uncertain benefits and the concern that therapy may actually increase the risk of SGA. Based on supportive preliminary data presented herein, we hypothesize that antihypertensive therapy for CHTN during pregnancy to the goal <140/90 mmHg as currently recommended for the non-pregnant hypertensive population, will reduce the risk of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. During a 6-year project period, our consortium of 12 academic perinatal centers (25 sites), will identify 4700 women with mild CHTN and standardized BP<155/100 mmHg (which providers are more comfortable not treating) in early pregnancy and randomize them to either antihypertensive therapy (using labetalol) or to management according to ACOG recommendations (antihypertensive therapy for more severe CHTN). The women will be followed-up until discharge from the hospital after delivery and up to 3 months postpartum (long-term follow-up, including an interim 6-month phone call, is anticipated as a separate related project). The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1.1 Primary Aim: To determine if pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN in pregnancy to a standardized BP goal<140/90 mmHg, compared with standard management (per ACOG: no treatment unless hypertension is severe), reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including: 1) a severe perinatal composite outcome (perinatal death, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or indicated PTB <35 weeks) and 2) SGA. 1.2 Secondary Aims: i. To better quantify the incidence during pregnancy of rare maternal cardiovascular risks associated with mild CHTN (including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure) and examine the effect of treatment. ii. To investigate the optial gestational age to deliver women with CHTN in order to minimize maternal and perinatal complications. iii. To collect and store biospecimens including maternal blood, cord blood and placenta biopsy for future biological and biophysical studies to understand the effects of antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy. iv. To evaluate whether antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy increases post-pregnancy treatment adherence.  This application summarizes the trial of the companion application and describes the operations of the DCC to provide full service electronic data capture, reporting and data management services. The extent of these data management services include: database specification, edit check programming, data management plan development and maintenance, ongoing manual data review and query management, medical coding and data cleaning and locking. Specific monitoring of observed blood pressures and blood pressure control along with safety monitoring will be a major endeavor. In addition, the DCC will provide statistical analysis (considering the pragmatic design) and reports which include the data summaries, tables, and statistical analyses for the DSMB.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a large pragmatic multi-center randomized trial of pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension to evaluate the benefits and harms of antihypertensive therapy to a goal <140/90 mmHg (as recommended for the general population in the US) compared with ACOG's current policy of expectant management of mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy. The trial will be conducted in 12 experienced research-oriented Ob/Gyn departments (including 25 clinical sites) in the United States.

5F31DK117550-02,FGF23 contributes to anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease by elevating hepcidin  production,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a health epidemic that increases the risk of death due to systemic inflammation
and anemia which affects up to 60% of patients by the time they reach dialysis. Early metabolic complications of
CKD, such as elevated serum concentrations of bone-derived fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, are strongly
associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein
(CRP), and of iron regulators, including hepcidin, and with mortality. In a recent experimental study, we
demonstrated that FGF23 contributes to inflammation by directly targeting hepatocytes through FGF receptor
isoform 4 (FGFR4) and inducing PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT signaling and the production of IL-6 and CRP. We found
that animal models with FGF23 elevations have increased hepatic and circulating levels of IL-6 and CRP, which
did not occur if FGFR4 was blocked or deleted. IL-6 is a potent inducer of hepcidin production in the liver by
activating IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in
hepatocytes. Hepcidin lowers serum iron levels by reducing iron absorption in different cell types, including
hepatocytes. Prolonged elevations of serum hepcidin levels, as observed in CKD, result in iron deficiency, and
the reduction of hepcidin production can serve as a therapeutic approach to tackle anemia. The purpose of this
proposal is to study functional interactions between FGF23, IL-6 and hepcidin. We postulate that by increasing
IL-6 production, FGF23 can elevated hepatic and systemic levels of hepcidin and contribute to anima. This
hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data showing that FGF23 significantly increases hepcidin expression
in primary mouse hepatocytes. This effect occurs only after 48 hours of FGF23 treatment and involves the
activation of STAT3. In Aim 1, we will determine if phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT3 as well
as expression and release of hepcidin in FGF23-treated mouse hepatocytes is reduced by inhibitors of the
PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT or the IL-6R/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. We will repeat the experiment in
hepatocytes isolated from FGFR4 knockout (FGFR4-/-) mice or following viral knockdown of IL-6 or IL-6R. In Aim
2, we will determine if deletion or blockade of FGFR4 in animal models with elevated FGF23 reduces hepcidin
production and protects from anemia. We have reported that administration of FGF23 in mice increases hepatic
and circulating levels of IL-6 within five days. Our preliminary studies indicate that Alport mice, a genetic model
of CKD with high FGF23 levels, show elevated IL-6 and hepcidin expression in the liver and develop anemia.
We will subject FGFR4-/- mice to chronic FGF23 infusions using osmotic minipumps, and we will administer a
FGFR4-specific small molecule inhibitor to Alport mice, followed by the analysis of IL-6 and hepcidin expression
in the liver and of serological iron parameters. We postulate that via the proposed mechanism, elevated FGF23
concentrations can contribute to CKD-associated anemia and that pharmacological FGFR4 blockade might
serve as novel anti-anemic intervention in patients with CKD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develops systemic inflammation and reduced iron
levels (also called anemia) which can both contribute to early death. In patients with CKD, circulating levels of
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and hepcidin are markedly elevated, and together these

and response to pathophysiological stress. Although bioenergetic metrics have been surveyed in a broad
range of aging models these parameters have yet to be integrated with measures of the control of
mitochondrial quality and mitochondrial genetics. We have introduced the concept of Bioenergetic health in
translational research and now plan to extend this to models of aging. In the Comparative Mitochondrial
Health Assessment core both state of the art and established techniques in bioenergetics, mitochondrial
genetics, autophagy and redox biology will be offered. The mechanisms controlling mitochondrial health
involve mitochondrial genetics, mitochondrial-nuclear interaction and mitophagy. The novel models offered to
the aging community will be the mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX) mice which have been pioneered at
UAB. This allows the contribution of specific mitochondrial DNA sequences to the process of aging to be
assessed independent of the nuclear contribution. State of the art experimental design, and protocols for
assessing cellular bioenergetics in response to oxidative and metabolic stress will also be used. As autophagy
and mitophagy have been shown to be essential for healthy lifespan, and insufficient autophagy contributes to
accumulation of protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria, indices of autophagic flux can be
measured. An important aspect of the Core is extending these techniques to a variety of traditional species
from yeast to mice, including both cryopreserved â€œcell zooâ€ of fibroblasts from about 60 species of mammals
and birds, a lot of these from species of â€œexceptional biogerontological interestâ€, as well as live species that are
either exceptionally long-lived or short-lived for their body size, such as the short-lived fish, Nothobranchius
furzeri. Specifically, services will be provided to NIA Regular and Supported Members and pilot & feasibility

including approaches we have pioneered in spheroid like cell structures and complex multi-cellular structures
such as pancreatic islets, vessel segments and adipose tissue, and complementing approaches with targeted
metabolomics and oxygen electrodes. 2. Quantitative oxidative stress parameters to assess indices of redox
changes including oxidized lipids, thiols and modified proteins. 3. Mitochondrial nuclear exchange (MNX)
models, mtDNA damage and haplotyping to test the unique contribution of mtDNA sequences to bioenergetics
and the resistance to metabolic and oxidative stress, with approaches available for both the traditional murine

5I01BX003497-03,Functional role of STRAP in colorectal cancer metastasis and in chemoresistance,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Despite the high rate of recurrence following therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) and relatively rapid
pace of cancer stem-like cell research in solid tumors, researches are impeded due to limited knowledge of the
CRC epithelial stem cell hierarchy and complex heterogeneity of the disease. Recent evidences suggest that
colorectal tumors comprise a small fraction of cancer stem-like cells that seed the tumor bulk and may be
responsible for metastasis, resistance to therapy, and tumor recurrence. Others (Buess et al., 2004) and we
(Halder et al, 2006) have shown that STRAP (Serine Threonine Kinase Receptor Associated Protein) is
significantly upregulated in colorectal carcinomas including metastases, and upregulation of STRAP in CRC
patients contributes to worse survival with chemotherapy, suggesting its potential contribution to the
aggressive disease and chemoresistance. Therefore, understanding the functional role of STRAP in CRC
metastasis, in the maintenance of cancer stem-like cells, and in chemoresistance is very crucial.
 We identified the novel WD-domain containing protein called STRAP that binds with both TGF-ÃŸ
receptor complex and Smad7, and inhibits TGF-ÃŸ signaling. We have shown that STRAP is upregulated in
several cancers, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition (Kashikar et al, 2010), and promotes cell
growth and tumorigenicity in vitro in a TGF-ÃŸ-independent manner (Halder et al, 2006). Our preliminary data
suggest that STRAP regulates the expression of MMPs, and Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin and Notch signaling. To determine
the role of STRAP in vivo, we have recently generated Strap knock out mice, which is embryonic lethal at 9.5
dpc. Azoxymethane treatment of the Strap heterozygous mice produces fewer and smaller tumors when
compared with wild type mice. To study the effect of STRAP in an organ specific manner, we have also
generated conditional knock out mice using the Cre-lox approach. Therefore, little is known about the TGF-ÃŸ-
independent role of STRAP in intestinal cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. Based on the background
information and our preliminary results, we have formulated the following hypotheses: Upregulation of STRAP
in colorectal cancer plays an active role in metastasis and its functional interaction with Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin and
Notch pathway is involved in colon cancer stem-like cell self-renewal and chemoresistance. The following
Specific Aims are proposed to test these hypotheses: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism of how STRAP
contributes to colorectal cancer metastasis. Aim 2: Determine the role of STRAP in the maintenance and self-
renewal of colon cancer stem-like cells. Aim 3: Determine the role of STRAP in regulating chemoresistance of
colorectal cancer.
 Impact: Despite the development of treatment regimens, metastasis remains the most critical
determinant of survival, as median survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is 5 months among
veterans. Moreover, drug resistance and relapse of cancers are the other two critical survival-influencing
factors of CRC. Completion of the proposed aims will uncover the novel function of STRAP in CRC
metastasis, stem-like cell self-renewal, and drug resistance. The outcome of this project will provide strong
translational potential to develop therapeutics by targeting STRAP for this un-targetable aggressive disease.
This basic and preclinical biomedical research will include two priority research areas of specific interest to
BLR&D, risky behavior related to smoking and women's health (RFA# BX-16-001).","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The aberrant regulation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes play a pivotal role in the transition from
normal colon epithelium into carcinoma in situ, and eventually into invasive and metastatic cancer. STRAP, a
cellular protein, is upregulated in colorectal cancer and is involved in intestinal cancer progression, metastasis,
and chemoresistance. This study is designed to understand, at the molecular level, the mechanism by which
STRAP contributes to metastasis of colorectal tumors, cancer stem-like cell self-renewal, and
chemotherapeutic resistance. Â ",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,PRAN K DATTA
5U48DP006404-02,CHEER Center for the Study of Community Health,"Project Abstract
THE UAB Center for the Study of Community Health, a University Wide Interdisciplinary Research Center, has adopted
specific aims to 1) provide a University platform for community-based participatory research (CBPR); 2) engage
stakeholders via education and service; 3) pursue research that enhances community health; and 4) facilitate the
translation of evidence-based programs into practice. Long-term objectives are to 1) develop CBPR tools and
methodologies; and 2) create a unified community engagement portal for the University. The core intervention research
project, â€œCommunity Health from Engagement and Environmental Renewal (CHEER),â€ originates from meetings with city
residents who defined their key community needs as blight and childrenâ€™s future success. CHEER builds on our and other
observational studies demonstrating that youth risk behaviors are associated with family and neighborhood adversities.
Multiple studies have built a solid research base to inform our understanding of the many upstream social determinants
that contribute to poor health and increased health disparities. While we know that altering the future trajectories of
vulnerable urban youth will require multilevel efforts that influence both family and community systems, efforts to do so
with interventions of sufficient intensity to bring measured lasting effects have not been conducted or disseminated.
Further advancements in community health research will require rigorous studies that test causal hypotheses in a
randomized controlled trial that evaluates the independent and combined effects of a Family System intervention and a
Community System intervention compared to a Wait-List Control condition. In this 5-year project we will employ a 2 x 2
design and recruit 780 parent-youth pairs to examine (and aim to improve) adversities at the family (e.g. maternal
stress, depression, and parenting practices) and community (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage and decay, and social
isolation) levels, testing their independent and combined effects, including possible synergies of these interventions, on
our primary outcomes of improved social norms, social cohesion, and collective efficacy and reduced early and risky sex
and externalizing and internalizing behaviors among youth. The Family System Intervention will test an individually
tailored (using baseline skill levels to determine dose), personally paced intervention facilitated by Community Health
Advisors and delivered via e-health or print media. Goals are to enhance maternal coping and emotional regulation to
positively impact parenting practices and parent-child communication and to reduce family conflict. The Community
System Intervention will offer micro-grants for greening vacant, unkempt lots through community-driven projects (e.g.
gardens, picnic, and playground areas) Goals are to encourage social interactions to enhance social cohesion and
collective efficacy and to increase shared norms. These neighborhood projects will be led by volunteer community
leaders and organizers. CHEER will inform the science on direct effects of each intervention as well as their underlying
mechanisms. The CHEER effective interventions will be translated with deliverables that ensure sustainability and
scalability. With the overall goal to improve quality of life and reduce health disparities, CHEER will contribute to
community engaged research and serve as a blueprint for the future of evidence-based public health that can be
translated and ensure sustainability and scalability.","Project Narrative
The UAB Center for the Study of Community Health supports community-based research, prevention,
outreach, and education to enhance community health in Alabama, a Deep South state with significant
health disparities beginning early in life that persist across the life course. CHEER will test the
independent and combined effects of two system-level interventions to improve health and quality of

1I01HX002082-01A1,Health Care Utilization of Veterans Receiving Supported Employment,"Background: Iraq and Afghanistan war (OIF/OEF) Veterans have experienced repeated deployment-
related stressors that put them at risk for health conditions that can negatively impact their post-deployment
readjustment. Employment is a key indicator of successful reintegration, but OIF/OEF Veterans are less
likely to be employed than their civilian counterparts, identifying difficulties at work and job loss as barriers
to readjusting to civilian life. Additional challenges include psychiatric conditions, including posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), which is estimated to affect approximately 20% of OIF/OEF Veterans. Among the
5% costliest patients receiving VA care in fiscal year 2010, 17% had a PTSD diagnosis. Among these, their
inpatient cumulative behavioral length of stay was 3.6 days, and outpatient utilization included 18.6 mental
health visits, 1.8 emergency department visits, 6.5 primary care visits, and 5.2 subspecialty visits.
Unemployment and service-connected disability in OIF/OEF Veterans has the potential to increase VA
acute care service utilization, which may strain and have a long-term impact on VA resources, given that the
OIF/OEF cohort will likely use VA services for six more decades. Interventions that assist Veterans in
recovery and return to employment are expanding in the VA, but little is known about how these evidence-
based interventions and subsequent return to work impacts the health service utilization patterns in
unemployed Veterans with PTSD. This study seeks to gather this evidence to inform policy and practices in
the delivery of the most effective vocational rehabilitation program for Veterans with PTSD.
Methods: This study will evaluate the health service utilization among recently unemployed Veterans with a
diagnosis of PTSD who have been randomized to receive either Individual Placement and Support (IPS) or
Transitional Work (TW). IPS is an evidence-based model of supported employment, which is an assertive,
person-centered, patient-driven approach to vocational rehabilitation. VA IPS has been available to
Veterans with severe mental illness and to those who are homeless, but has not been accessible to
Veterans with a primary diagnosis of PTSD. In 2013, under the leadership of Dr. Davis, VA Cooperative
Studies Program (CSP) launched a multisite randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of IPS
to TWP for Veterans with PTSD (n=541) in terms of employment outcomes, PTSD symptoms, self-esteem
and quality of life. This large, prospectively randomized, geographically diverse group of unemployed
Veterans with PTSD represents a unique opportunity to learn more about the impacts of IPS on health care
utilization. The specific aims of this study are to 1) compare the acute care utilization in Veterans with PTSD
prospectively randomized to IPS versus TW; 2) compare the costs for high intensity services (i.e. inpatient,
ED, domiciliary, residential) services and for outpatient services among Veterans with PTSD randomized to
IPS versus TW; and 3) assess the cost-effectiveness of IPS relative to TW among Veterans with PTSD.
Significance: Despite a decade of IPS implementation and a world-class medical record system within VA,
no research has been conducted to evaluate the impact of IPS compared to TWP within VA on health care
service utilization in a PTSD population. However, the strong evidence for reduction in acute care services
among persons with serious mental illness randomized to IPS from US and international randomized clinical
trials compels us to learn more about IPS in the VA setting and in a PTSD population. As more evidence
emerges about the clinical effectiveness of IPS, stakeholders eagerly want to know if IPS has the potential
to reduce the use of high intensity acute care services and potential cost effectiveness. This first-of-its-kind

5I01RX001489-05,Efficacy of Supported Employment within the OIF/OEF Patient Aligned Care Team,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Efficacy of Supported Employment within the OIF/OEF Patient Aligned Care Team Background: Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan wars often confront unemployment as they reintegrate into civilian life. Over the past two decades, studies of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment have yielded remarkably robust and consistent vocational rehabilitation outcomes. However, IPS has predominantly only been studied in mental health settings and in the seriously mentally ill populations. Access to a mental health setting for recently deployed Veterans is often delayed by months or years, and thus, result in substantial delay of referrals to vocational rehabilitation programs which leave many Veterans vulnerable to continued unemployment and a deteriorating trajectory. Methods: This is a single site, prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of IPS when delivered within a primary care Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) designated for Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans. Participants will be OEF/OIF/OND Veterans receiving care in the PACT who are currently unemployed and have a disabling or potentially disabling Axis I diagnosis, other than a serious mental illness and will
be randomized 1:1 to either IPS or the VHA standard of care called Transitional Work Program. Compared to Transitional Work Program (control condition), IPS delivered within a PACT is hypothesized to result in a higher rate of steady workers, as defined by working >50% of the weeks in the 12-month follow-up period in a competitive job (primary); quality of life, and self esteem (secondary), improved community re-integration (exploratory), improved psychiatric symptoms (exploratory), and lower rates of high intensity crisis events/services (exploratory). In addition, IPS delivered within a PACT will be feasible and yield very good Veteran satisfaction. Significance: In an innovative approach, this study breaks from the diagnostic categorical approach and the mental health treatment setting and evaluates the efficacy of IPS when delivered in a primary care setting, specifically a PACT that serves Veterans who have returned from the Iraq or Afghanistan conflicts. Making a substantial paradigm shift, this study will integrate IPS within a PACT for the first time ever. The research is directly linked to the RR&D priority areas of improving vocational outcomes and promoting recovery in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.   
   
","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    
In response to the RR&D Deployment Health Research (OEF/OIF), this study addresses the delivery of an evidenced-based vocational rehabilitation, specifically Individual Placement and Support (IPS), for OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who often face unemployment and mental illness as they try to recovery from illness and re-establish civilian life. This study provides the requisite
evidence needed to guide VHA as to whether to expand the target population for IPS to all Veterans with a mental disorder, delivered directly within the primary care setting (i.e. Patient Aligned Care Team; PACT). Such modifications in VHA practice could substantially improve Veteran vocational rehabilitation access and outcomes, moving a significantly greater number of disabled Veterans back to full and productive lives in the community.

5R01AI110553-05,Roles of FCRL Molecules in Innate Immunity,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innate-like splenic marginal zone (MZ) and peritoneal cavity-derived (PEC) B1 B lineage cells share critical importance at the earliest stages of humoral immune defense by rapidly sensing pathogens and mounting primary antibody responses. However, the mechanistic basis for their robust responsivity to innate thymus- independent stimuli and involvement in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. A multigene family termed FCR-like (FCRL1-6) encodes Ig-like transmembrane proteins with complex tyrosine-based immunoregulatory function that are preferentially expressed by B cells. Their immunologic significance is underscored by their evolutionary conservation and growing associations with human lymphoproliferative, autoimmune, infectious, and immunodeficiency disorders. Although these relationships implicate the FCRLs as pathogenic factors, studies thus far indicate that they generally inhibit B cell antigen-receptor (BCR) signaling. Several representatives have recently been found to interact with MHC-related proteins as well as immunoglobulins; however, the endogenous ligands and in vivo functions of most FCRL molecules expressed by B cells have not yet been defined. The long-term objective of our studies is to determine the role of the FCRL protein family in normal and perturbed immunobiology. FCRL5, the focus of this proposal, is uniquely expressed by innate-like MZ and B1 B cells in mice, has both ITAM-like and ITIM cytoplasmic sequences, and exerts dual-regulatory influence on BCR signaling by recruiting Lyn and SHP-1. Despite its discrete distribution, little is known about its impact or that of other FCRLs on innate immunity. The central hypothesis is that FCRL5 catalyzes innate T cell-independent responses in B cells through interactions with a recently defined counterpart. Based on supporting preliminary data three Specific Aims are proposed. The first Aim will determine the impact of FCRL5 deficiency on innate responses. The second Aim will dissect the mechanistic influence of FCRL5 in regulating innate-like B cell functions. In Aim 3 we will characterize structure/function interactions between FCRL5 and a newfound ligand. The proposed work is innovative because it harnesses conserved interspecies features and in vivo approaches that are expected to substantially shift our understanding of these receptors in innate immunity. The contributions of this study will be significant because they will provide new knowledge by integrating complex signaling and ligand relationships for FCRL5 in innate-like B cells and advancing our understanding of the physiologic impact of these interactions in regulating innate defense responses. These outcomes are anticipated to have a positive impact because they will establish a fundamental translational platform that provides insight into the pathogenic influence of FCRL molecules in immune disorders and reveals new avenues for disease prevention and treatment.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will investigate the functional roles of a family of receptors in immune system B lymphocytes that influence humoral defense responses and are linked with disease pathogenesis. The work will be important to NIH's mission because it will have broad impact that advances fundamental understanding of the immune system and has implications for developing new therapeutic approaches for vaccination and immune-related disorders including autoimmunity and lymphoma/leukemia.,2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Prevention,RANDALL S DAVIS
5R01MH114990-02,Enhancer RNA Regulation of Experience-dependent Neuroepigenetic Processes,"Distal enhancer elements in DNA enable higher-order chromatin interactions that facilitate gene expression
programs and thus contribute to cellular phenotype and function. Enhancers regulate numerous aspects of cell
and tissue-specific gene expression patterns in the developing and adult brain, and have been highly
implicated in mental health and disease. In neuronal systems, enhancer elements are subject to widespread,
bidirectional transcription that yields non-coding enhancer RNA (eRNA). However, the precise function of
eRNAs is still unclear, with different models proposing unique regulatory functions. Emerging evidence
suggests that eRNAs function to modify epigenetic states at gene regulatory elements, which are critical for
long-term behavioral and neuronal plasticity. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to utilize whole-genome
sequencing approaches to define transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of neuronal activity at enhancers. In
addition to revealing new therapeutic candidates, this aim will employ novel targeted eRNA delivery strategies
based on CRISPR technology to allow manipulation of eRNAs at specific enhancers to determine their
function. Specific Aim 2 will examine interactions between eRNAs and epigenetic profiles at enhancers and
promoters of linked genes, which will establish the hierarchical relationships between molecular interactions at
enhancers. Specific Aim 3 will examine the contributions of eRNAs to neuronal function and memory formation
in the adult brain using hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning, a robust assay of learning and
memory that requires activity-dependent gene transcription. This novel approach will demonstrate the
necessity of unique eRNAs at specific genes for neuronal activity and behavior, and also enable the first
investigation of whether modulation of eRNAs is sufficient to alter memory function. In addition to revealing the
exact nature and scope of eRNAs in neuronal gene regulation, this proposal will pave the way for future
experiments that will explore how manipulation of enhancers could be used to reprogram circuits that have
become maladaptive in mental illness and cognitive disease states.","Genomic enhancers are essential for brain development and function, and dysregulation of enhancer elements

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder in which drug-related associations are capable of exerting tremendous control over behavior long after drug taking has ceased. Epigenetic modifications in the central nervous system are critical for long-term behavioral and neuronal plasticity, and have been implicated in numerous features of motivated behavior, drug-related learning, and addiction. However, our ability to harness the therapeutic potential of epigenetic manipulations in the context of addiction has been limited by the lack of detailed insight into epigenetic dynamics following drug experiences, and the inability
to target specific epigenetic alterations in real time to interrogate their molecular and behaviora function. This proposal seeks to utilize single-cell whole-epigenome sequencing approaches to define epigenetic signatures of drug experience in specific neuronal populations. In addition to revealing new therapeutic candidates, this information will be directly applied to targeted epigenetic editing strategies based on CRISPR technology, which will allow manipulation of epigenetic states at specific drug-regulated genes. This novel approach will demonstrate the necessity of unique epigenetic modifications at specific genes for drug-associated behaviors, and also enable the first investigation of whether an epigenetic modification is sufficient to alte reward function. Finally, we will integrate these tools with ontogenetic approaches to enable light-driven manipulation of epigenetic states in freely moving animals. Thus, in addition to revealing the exact nature and scope of epigenetic states following drug experience, this proposal will be the first to investigate how these modifications contribute to the function of reward circuits and ultimately to reward seeking behavior in general.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exposure to drugs of abuse produces long-lasting changes in neuronal circuits that mediate reward-related learning and decision-making. This proposal will investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in these changes, providing insight into the molecular basis by which these mechanisms contribute to drug addiction. We will use these insights to develop new tools that target specific epigenetic processes in the brain, which will lead to more effective epigenetics-based treatment and prevention strategies for drug addiction and improve quality of life for addicted individuals.",2019,441000,300000,141000,Non-SBIR/STTR,DP1,National Institute on Drug Abuse,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Genetics; Neurosciences; Substance Abuse,JEREMY J DAY

5R01HL132156-04,HL-Lung stem cells and their niches,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HL-131: To function as an intact barrier, epithelia must maintain constant cell numbers despite sometimes high rates of turnover. If the rate of cell death exceeds proliferation, epithelial barrier function could become compromised; if it lags behind proliferation, cells could amass into tumors. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that keep airway epithelial stem cells largely quiescent during homeostasis or in check after a regenerative response to prevent the tissue overcrowding and dysplasia associated with airway remodeling in chronic lung diseases like COPD and asthma. After airway epithelial injury, surviving epithelial cells spread out to maintain barrier function and secrete Wnt7b to induce fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) expression and proliferation in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Fgf10 secreted by the ASMCs then acts on surviving club cells to initiate epithelial repair by breaking quiescence and inducing proliferation. The objective of this project is to identify the key signals that keep this Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade silent during normal homeostasis or once regeneration is complete, but activate the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade when airway epithelial injury is sensed. Recent work in the lung has identified a role for the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in regulating airway epithelial stem/progenitor cell quiescence during normal homeostasis. In addition, it was shown that the Hippo pathway becomes inactivated in surviving airway epithelial cells when they spread out to maintain barrier function shortly after injury, likely to initiate repair. We therefore hypothesize, that the Hippo pathway keeps airway epithelial/stem progenitor cells quiescent during normal homeostasis by inhibiting activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling cascade. We have identified substantial aberrant signaling of the above-described pathways in clinical samples of COPD. We further hypothesize that when surviving airway epithelial cells spread out, signals are transduced by integrins to induce Yap/Taz-mediated Wnt7b expression. Interestingly, the scaffolding protein integrin linked kinase (Ilk) has been proposed to be essential for the proper termination of liver regeneration by positively regulating the Hippo pathway. Based on these findings the overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that: Ilk in the airway epithelium maintains stem cell quiescence by positively regulating the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway to block activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling axis and prevent airway remodeling as observed in chronic lung diseases. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the Hippo pathway blocks activation of the Wnt7b- Fgf10 signaling axis between airway epithelial progenitors and their niche during normal homeostasis. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that during normal homeostasis Ilk positively regulates the Hippo pathway in airway epithelial cells, to inhibit activation of the Wnt7b-Fgf10 repair pathway. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether human airway remodeling in COPD patients is associated with deregulated Ilk-Hippo- Wnt7b-Fgf10 signaling.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic lung diseases and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. These diseases are thought to involve a chronic injury-repair cycle that leads to improper regeneration and the eventual breakdown of normal airway and/or alveolar structure and function resulting in loss of respiratory function. To fulfill the promise of regenerative medicine in the lung, this study aims o identify the molecular mechanisms that keep stem cells quiescent during homeostasis or in check after a regenerative response to prevent airway remodeling",2019,492309,331521,160788,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Lung; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human,Stijn Piet Johan De Langhe
1R13HL146160-01,Epithelial mesenchymal interactions in lung development and fibrosis,"We are requesting funds in partial support of the 1st Fusion Conference on Epithelial-mesenchymal
interactions in lung development and fibrosis, to be held February 17-20th 2019 at Melia Nassau Beach,
Nassau, Bahamas. There is growing appreciation that processes and pathways critical for normal lung
development are important for postnatal tissue homeostasis and are dysregulated in lung disease. Principal
objectives of this Fusion Conference are 1. Provide an international forum to promote interaction between
established and young scientists working in the broad fields of lung development, injury and repair, but with a
focus on epithelial mesenchymal interactions that direct lung development, postnatal tissue homeostasis and
disease, 2. To provide a forum for networking and career advancement for students, postdoctoral trainees, and
faculty at all levels from early stage to established senior investigators, and 3. To encourage creative and
multidisciplinary research aimed at understanding mechanisms of normal tissue development and postnatal
homeostasis, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and the development of novel interventions that
target lung disease. To achieve these objectives, we have organized a program with six scientific sessions
including (1) Keynote and emerging topics, (2) Fgf signaling in lung development and fibrosis, (3) Aging and lung
fibrosis, (4) Lung stem/progenitor cells and their regulation in health and disease, (5) Organoid cultures to model
lung development and disease, and (6) Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in lung development and fibrosis.
Each of these sessions will be chaired by an expert in the field in addition to the inclusion of three panelists to
promote vibrant discussion of critical issues in the field and opportunities for further investigation. Besides
presentations by invited speakers, shorter presentations will be given by junior, new investigators based on
submitted abstracts. The meeting will also include two poster viewing sessions; all posters will be displayed
continuously throughout the meeting but attended viewing will be divided into two approximately equal groups to
further enhance informal interactions and sharing of ideas among participants.","Interactions between endodermal and mesodermal derivatives play instructive roles in regulating patterning and

1R01HL146461-01,Epithelial stem cell hippo signaling in pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common form of interstitial lung disease (ILD) resulting in alveolar
remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary function, respiratory failure, and death often within 5 years of
diagnosis. IPF pathogenesis encompasses fibrotic remodeling, inflammation, and loss of lung architecture.
Although the underlying causes of the disease remain elusive, genetic and experimental evidence support the
concept that chronic alveolar injury and failure to properly repair the respiratory epithelium are intrinsic to IPF
disease pathogenesis. Histologically, respiratory epithelial cells in the lung parenchyma express atypical
proximal airway epithelial and indeterminate cell type markers, including goblet and basal cell (BC)
characteristics that are normally restricted to conducting airways. Fibrotic lesions and honeycomb structures
replace alveolar structures, the latter normally lined by alveolar type 1 (AT1) and AT2 cells. Genome-wide
transcriptomic analyses of lung tissue and isolated epithelial cells from IPF patients demonstrate dramatic
changes in ciliated, basal, and goblet cellâ€“associated gene expression and loss of normal alveolar epithelial
cells, reflecting profound changes in epithelial cell differentiation and function in IPF. One strategy to attenuate
or reverse the manifestations of IPF is to trigger proper alveolar regeneration by endogenous lung stem cells.
Changes in cell density and matrix stiffness as a result of injury are sensed by the Hippo pathway, which
controls stem cell quiescence. Recent reports also indicate increased YAP activity in respiratory epithelial cells
in lungs of patients with IPF. Individual IPF epithelial cells that feature aberrant YAP activation in bronchiolized
honeycomb regions frequently co-expressed AT1, AT2, conducting airway selective markers and even
mesenchymal or EMT markers, demonstrating ""indeterminate"" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung
development. Our preliminary findings indicate that inactivation of the Hippo pathway impairs alveolar epithelial
regeneration, whereas inactivation of Yap promotes the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis. Using the new
techniques and tools we have generated we will define the molecular pathways and mechanism by which the
Hippo pathway controls alveolar epithelial regeneration after bleomycin injury.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive, and ultimately fatal disorder with a poorly
understood pathogenesis and no cure. IPF lungs feature honeycomb regions, which are lined with confused

1K01HL145324-01,Role of endothelin in hypertension-mediated inflammation and end-organ damage,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extensive evidence demonstrates that individuals that regularly consume high salt diet have a greater risk of
developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) compared to individuals on low salt diet. Moreover, dietary
consumption of high salt and the associated inflammation have critical roles in the development of CVD, such
as hypertension. Particularly, T cells are intimately linked to the development of hypertension. However there is
a gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in salt-mediated T cell activation, end-organ damage and
CVD risk.
Levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoactive peptide, are elevated after high salt consumption. Renal
inflammation is one of the hallmarks of salt-sensitive hypertension, and ET-1 is known to exert pro-inflammatory
actions in renal tissue. In fact, human T cells express ET-1 receptors (ETA and ETB) on their surface and are
activated by ET-1 in vitro. Recent reports demonstrate that high salt induces production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines by T cells. Despite the many studies demonstrating that the renal ET-1 system is an important
contributor to increased blood pressure, inflammation and kidney damage during high sodium intake, the
molecular mechanisms by which ET-1 mediates these effects remain obscure. Further, the involvement of ET-1
in renal T cell activation and target organ damage during salt-dependent hypertension needs investigation.
High salt consumption increases ET-1 production by several cellular sources in the kidney, although the cellular
source of ET-1 mediating renal T cell activation and differentiation during high salt remains unclear.
This proposal aims to elucidate novel molecular pathways involved in the control of the renal pathophysiology
associated with increased blood pressure. This proposal will test that 1) activation of the ET-1/ETA axis leads to
kidney T cell activation during salt-sensitive hypertension and results in salt-induced kidney damage and CVD
risk, and 2) elevated vascular endothelium-derived ET-1 is responsible for the kidney damage observed during
high salt consumption.
With the help of my mentor and scientific advisory team, I will continue on the path toward my long-term goal of
developing a strong and independent research program at the intersection of immunology and cardio-renal
physiology, with the ultimate goal of translating this knowledge to improve human health. If awarded, this K01
award will help me to achieve extra training to become a successful basic science investigator in the field of
cardio-renal physiology.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1F30DK121398-01,Agonism of DR3 for Enhanced Treg Cell Function in IBD,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The immune-mediated, chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) leads to flares that often
require patients to be treated with life-long biologic therapy. Recently, efforts in IBD disease management have
focused on the potential of regulatory T (Treg) cell-based therapy as an alternative to traditional treatments. Treg
cells limit inflammatory responses to both foreign and self-antigens and can become further differentiated into
potently suppressive effector Tregs (eTregs) upon exposure to immune stimuli. eTregs, especially those that
produce the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10), play a critical, mitigating role in both human and
murine colitis. However, the signals that induce and functionally enhance this subset are not well understood,
largely because they are limited in number and there have been no suitable protocols to differentiate them in
vitro. Here, we have identified a signal that enhances the expansion and maintenance of IL-10+ eTregs in vivo
and in vitro. Death receptor 3 (DR3 or TNFRSF25) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)
member that is constitutively expressed by activated T cells and has been found to both enhance and suppress
the immune response. We have found that treatment with an agonist antibody to DR3 (aDR3) significantly
enhances the proliferation and cell survival specifically of IL-10+ eTregs. Additionally, treatment greatly expands
total Treg cells in many tissues, but the effect is most profound in the intestine. To our knowledge, the observation
that aDR3 expands IL-10 producing eTregs has not yet been described. This proposal will determine the
mechanisms by which DR3 signaling induces increased intestinal Tregs (Aim 1), as well as the potential of aDR3
as a therapeutic in the treatment of colitis (Aim 2). We will utilize a novel transgenic mouse model that lacks DR3
specifically in Tregs to understand the role that DR3 signaling plays in intestinal Treg function in both the steady
state and in the inflamed colon. By using our IL-10 and Foxp3 dual reporter mouse, we will be able to stratify
Treg populations by IL-10 competency, which will allow us to characterize the mechanisms by which DR3
differentially enhances Treg cell subsets. Our central hypothesis is that the effect of DR3 signaling is two-fold in
that it: (1) primes Treg cells for an effector phenotype; and (2) enacts a specific program that impacts eTreg
survival, stability, and function. Understanding how this pathway augments Treg cell function will have broad-
reaching implications not only in the field of IBD, but also in the management of a number of immune-mediated
diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

factorial disease is largely unknown, however aberrant T cell responses in the gut are thought to play a pivotal

significantly enhances proliferation and survival of IL-10-producing effector regulatory T cells, and whether this

1R03DK119464-01,Sensory Afferent Mechanisms Contributing  to Diabetic Bladder Dysfunction,"ABSTRACT
Diabetic bladder dysfunction (DBD) refers to a spectrum of urinary bladder symptoms that manifest in the majority
of people with diabetes mellitus. Secondary sequelae of DBD are often health-compromising, and diminished
bladder control markedly reduces quality of life. Like its phenotype, the pathogenesis of DBD is multifaceted.
Changes in the autonomic nervous system and detrusor that contribute to DBD are well described; however,
there is suggestive evidence that the peripheral nervous system is part of the pathogenesis. It is clearly evident
from diabetic cutaneous neuropathy that sensory neural changes do occur, and the contribution of those changes
to the development and progression of DBD merit more attention. With an overarching goal of identifying
therapeutic targets to treat or prevent diabetes-induced changes in bladder-innervating PANs that play a role in
DBD, we propose to characterize their functional, neurochemical, and genetic changes in an animal model of
diabetes. In parallel, we will examine peripheral nerve changes in bladder tissue from individuals with a history
of diabetes who present with DBD to inform the translational relevance of our animal model findings. Objective,
clinical evidence of neuropathic bladder dysfunction in diabetic individuals who self-report being â€œasymptomaticâ€
has suggested there is a high frequency of subclinical diabetic neuropathy. Development of cystopathy may be
prevented in those with subclinical neuropathy by targeted intervention, potential targets of which we hope to
identify. In turn, this could mitigate numerous secondary sequelae that cost money and impair quality of life.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1IS1BX004811-01,ShEEP Request for Next Generation High Dimension Flow Cytometer,"Inflammation and immunological mechanisms are at the epicenter of all disease mechanisms. High-parameter
flow cytometry is a powerful analytical tool that will enable the Birmingham VA Medical Center (BVAMC)
researchers to identify and analyze distinct phenotypes in the very heterogeneous populations of cells derived
from various sources of animal models and human specimens. There is no high dimensional flow cytometer at
the BVAMC or the affiliate, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), yet there is an acute need for
BVAMC investigators to have access to such an instrument. The BD FACSymphony features an ultra-quiet
VPX (also known as VITA 46), which is the next generation of ruggedized compact embedded electronic
systems that supports up to 50 high-performance photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and improves detection
sensitivity to enable the user to identify and analyze rare cell subtypes in advance. In order to understand the
causes of diseases such as cancer, kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes, or degenerative diseases of the
nervous system, it is important to define the cell population not at just one point in time but at multiple times in
a disease process. Multiparameter analysis improves the efficiency by requiring smaller sample volume and by
increasing sample throughput. This is critical for human samples available at limited amounts from human
tissue and body fluids. Increased number of parameters facilitates improved simultaneous functional
characterization of cells by intracellular staining of phosphorylated targets, cytokine and growth factor
production, analysis of cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondria membrane polarization, etc. These capacities are
critical for understanding a broad spectrum of single cells or fluids derived from VA patients in active studies by
the BVAMC investigators. For example, in Dr. Mountz's work in Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE), the BD
FACSymphony will be used to specifically and very individually determine the pathogenic phenotype of
autoreactive B cells and other cells in SLE patients and enable tailored precision medical therapy approaches.
The important precision medicine approaches can be best utilized and targeted when the abnormal cell
subpopulation in a specific individual and disease can be identified, and specifically suppressed. This is of
considerable importance to facilitate the development of effective therapies for VA patients who have
developed inflammatory and autoimmune diseases presented in this proposal. In another novel approach,
Drs. Dell'Italia and Gaggar will utilize the BD Symphony to track the secretion of exosomes in acute and
chronic lung and heart injury. Exosomes are membrane-bound structures secreted by a wide range of
mammalian cell types carrying and transporting cellular cargo in normal and pathologic states. The ability to
utilize flow cytometry to directly interrogate individual exosomes and their content is tremendously valuable and
offers insight to the pathogenic features of a given exosome population. In each of the projects presented in
this proposal, there is a similar targeted cellular approach for cardiac, pulmonary, vascular kidney disease and
cancer, as well as immunological disease of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. The application of
this exciting new technology will enhance funding capabilities and most importantly our research goals and
mission of Veteran-centric medical care.","The Birmingham VA Medical Center (BVAMC) has always embodied an interdisciplinary research program that
is Veteran centered, results-driven, and disease oriented. The current proposal is the first step in our forward
thinking delivery of health care in the burgeoning field of precision medicine. We believe that these approaches
can be best utilized when the abnormal subpopulation in a specific individual can be identified and specifically
targeted with rational therapy. By understanding these diseases at the cellular level at various time points from
patient blood, body fluids or tissue biopsies, we are working for a future in which these diseases can be prevented
or treated. The current request is for a new cutting-edge technology that can specifically and very individually
determine the pathogenic phenotype of various cell types, including inflammatory, malignant, stem cells, and
microvesicles in patients that enable potentially novel tailored precision medical therapy approaches.",2019,,,,Other Research-Related,IS1,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,Louis J. Dell'Italia
5I01BX003664-03,Pathophysiology of Extracellular Matrix and Desmin Breakdown in Volume Overload Heart,"The importance of the extracellular matrix loss in adverse LV remodeling is well established in the isolated
pure volume overload of mitral regurgitation. Here the Principal Investigator reports a newly described
breakdown of cardiomyocyte cytoskeletal protein desmin that adds an important intracellular structural defect
with a direct impact on cardiomyocyte contractile function. This extracellular and intracellular protein
breakdown mandates a novel medical therapy that enhances fibroblast extracellular matrix production and
prevents desmin breakdown in order to prevent LV dilatation and heart failure. The novel findings of the current
proposal are: 1) the ability of the highly destructive serine protease chymase to enter the cardiomyocyte via an
endocytic mechanism, 2) the high chymase concentration within cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts in the heart, 3)
evidence of chymase digestion of desmin in the heart with a pure volume overload, 4) evidence of chymase-
mediated intracellular autophagic digestion of procollagen and fibronectin digestion in fibroblasts form the
volume overloaded heart. It is well accepted that a pure volume overload is accompanied by excessive
adrenergic drive. To complement the potential actions of chymase inhibitor, we have shown that Î²1-receptor
blockade (Î²1-RB) improves calcium homeostasis and breakdown of the focal adhesion complex. We
hypothesize that desmin and extracellular matrix breakdown are important therapeutic targets in volume
overload that are responsive to a combined Î²1-RB and chymase inhibition that improves LV dilatation and
function. In the series of aims, we will explore the intracellular (cardiomyocyte desmin) and extracellular
(fibroblast autophagy) mechanisms of protein breakdown and resultant effects on LV remodeling and function.
The mechanism of extracellular matrix loss and desmin breakdown in VO is multifactorial and here we propose
novel mechanisms for a combined therapy of Î²1-RB and chymase inhibition that will target cardiomyocyte
desmin breakdown (Aim 1) and fibroblast digestion of procollagen by autophagy (Aim 2), resulting in
attenuation of LV dilatation and improvement in LV systolic function in the pure VO of ACF (Aim 3).","Heart disease is the number one cause of death in Americans including veterans. Every aspect of medical care
in the VA medical system is affected by its common presence. Mitral regurgitation creates a unique stress to
the heart by the regurgitation of blood backwards into the left atrium with contraction of the heart. The impetus
for the current proposal emanated from the fact that there is no effective medical therapy for this condition that
affects more than 6 million Americans. The Principal Investigator has now identified new mechanisms of
cardiac damage and proposes a novel combination therapy in this grant that targets these processes. Our
study will uncover new targets that lead to improved therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with
mitral regurgitation that will prevent heart failure and improve outcomes from surgery to repair or replace the

There are close to 15 million cancer survivors in the U.S., and the majority are 65 years of age or older.
Despite improvements in treatment and 5-year cure rates, cancer survivors are at greater risk for second
malignancies, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and functional impairment - downstream effects that result
in an annual cost of approximately $130 billion each year. Cancer survivorship has been claimed a national
priority, with a call to develop effective interventions that can prevent, delay, or mitigate the adverse effects and
comorbidities attendant with cancer and its treatment. Strong evidence exists that a healthful diet and regular
physical activity can prevent many chronic diseases and improves physical functioning. But, more research is
needed to develop interventions that can produce long-term adherence to healthful lifestyle behaviors.
This study builds on strong, R21-supported preliminary data, and relies on the extant infrastructure of the
Cooperative Extension Master Gardener Program. A total of 426 older (â‰¥65 yrs.) survivors of a loco-regionally

control arm that receives the intervention after a 1-year delay. All participants will be followed for 2 years. This
randomized controlled trial aims to: 1) determine the efficacy of the vegetable gardening intervention on fruit
and vegetable intake, physical activity AND physical function (assessed by self-report and backed by objective
measures: plasma Î±âˆ’carotene, accelerometry, and performance testing); 2) assess effects of the intervention
on secondary endpoints, e.g., quality of life, biomarkers of successful aging (interleukin-6 and telomerase); 3)
evaluate the durability and repeatability of the intervention; 4) explore participant factors related with program
efficacy (e.g., gender, co-morbidity, age); and 5) perform an economic analysis to assess the value of health
improvements relative to intervention costs. The proposed home-based, vegetable gardening intervention
(using raised beds or EarthboxesÂ® â€“ depending on survivors' living arrangements) is a novel and feasible
strategy to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and physical functioning in cancer survivors at high risk for
cancer-related morbidity â€“ one that has great clinical and public health significance given the increasing
number of cancer survivors and the high economic and societal costs associated with comorbid disease.
Moreover, the infrastructure for sustainability and wide-scale dissemination already exists as there are Master
Gardener Programs in all 50 United States, and the proposed intervention could easily be implemented in
states with 2 or more growing seasons (72% of states, plus the District of Columbia), thus reaching the vast
majority of older cancer survivors (roughly 10.8 million) who reside in the temperate zones of this nation.","Cancer survivors are at increased risk for age- and treatment-related comorbidities, including second cancers,
cardiovascular disease, and impaired physical functioning. A healthful diet and regular physical activity may
reduce the risk of chronic disease and functional decline in this vulnerable and rapidly expanding population.
Based on compelling pilot data, we propose a vegetable gardening intervention that pairs cancer survivors with
Cooperative Extension Master Gardeners as a novel intervention to improve dietary intake, physical activity,
physical functioning and biomarkers of successful aging.",2019,562377,409826,152551,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Physical Activity; Physical Rehabilitation; Prevention; Rehabilitation,Wendy  Demark-Wahnefried

Rates of obesity are high in the general population. Cancer survivors, however have even higher rates
because there are 13 distinct cancers for which obesity is a proven risk factor; plus, weight gain is a common
side effect with some cancer treatments. Given substantial evidence that obesity is a poor prognostic factor
that also associates with increased comorbidity, functional decline, and higher health care costs, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) issued a position statement urging intensified efforts to improve education
and resources, as well as advocating for research to determine optimal interventions and mechanisms of
action, and to increase access to resources and services for weight management among cancer survivors.
ASCO also underscored a particular need in underserved populations â€“ a need also long expressed by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI). Specifically, the NCI points to gaps in addressing the needs of older cancer
survivors from minority groups who reside in rural areas. In addition, because almost all research in cancer
survivorship has been conducted in breast cancer survivors, both the NCI and ASCO urge research in
survivors of other types of cancer. The proposed study directly addresses the gaps identified by ASCO and
NCI. We will adapt a previous intervention entitled RENEW, which had proven success in promoting weight
loss and significantly improving the lifestyle behaviors and functional status of older survivors of colorectal,
breast, and prostate cancer using computer-tailored mailed print and telephone counseling intervention, by
delivering it more broadly through a web-based platform. The 6-month RENEWeb intervention will then be
tested in 326 survivors of 7 select obesity and physical activity related cancers, significant proportions of whom
will be older, rural, and minority. Using a 2-arm randomized controlled design, survivors will be evenly and
randomly assigned to either RENEWeb or a wait-listed control arm. The primary aim will be to determine
between-arm differences in weight loss. Secondary aims will be to assess the effects of the intervention on
other clinical outcomes (i.e., lean body mass, physical functioning and performance), quality of life, diet and
physical activity behaviors, and relevant biomarkers of inflammation and successful aging (i.e., c-reactive
protein, interleukin-6 and -10, interferon Î³, and telomerase). Finally, we will identify the behavioral mechanisms
that drive the success of the intervention, as well as examine the characteristics of those who benefit most and
assess cost effectiveness. All of these efforts are ultimately directed toward improving health and
ascertaining effective interventions that have the broad reach necessary to help the most underserved
cancer survivors.","PROJECT 1

(processing incentives, IRB clearance and amendments, coordinating DSMB oversight, etc.) and work required
for all program components. In addition, the Admin SRC team will arrange for meetings amongst the
investigators, and perform the majority of supply shipment, as well as file progress reports. As part of the
supplies, the Admin SRC will provide computer tablets and internet service coverage to any study participants
who do have current internet access via computers, smartphones or other devices; the IT specialist within this
SRC also will provide training and guidance for participants who require this support in order to participate fully
in the 3 projects. This SRC also will maintain the study toll-free number and will track, triage, and report any
adverse events, and also will coordinate annual DSMB reviews.
The Specific Aims are to: (1) Integrate overarching program aims with project-specific outcomes; (2)
Coordinate the activities of the research projects and resource cores to ensure that the AMPLIFI goals and
outcomes are achieved; and (3) Lead effective management and scientific integration of AMPLIFI components.
Using a comprehensive approach, we will leverage our shared resource cores and infrastructure to accomplish
the following: 1) identify how best to reach underserved older, rural, and minority cancer survivors; 2) engage
survivors in exercising more and making healthier food choices that result in improved diet quality and weight
control; 3) determine whether behavioral interventions in specific domains should be presented sequentially or
simultaneously in this population; and assess the cost-effectiveness of the adapted health behavior
interventions. Thus, the proposed work is integrated and synergistic across multiple dimensions to leverage

 By 2020, the number of cancer survivors in the US will exceed 20 million due to trends toward aging,
and improved cancer screening and treatment. Cancer survivorship is a victory, but it comes at a price. Once
an individual is diagnosed with cancer, they are at much higher risk for second malignancies, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and functional decline (resulting in a loss of independence). Currently, the
costs for these downstream effects are estimated to be at least $135 billion annually.
 Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., a poor diet resulting in obesity and physical inactivity) associate with
poorer outcomes after a cancer diagnosis. These behaviors also tend to cluster, i.e., people who practice one
unhealthy behavior tend to practice another. It is hypothesized that cancer survivors may be able to improve
their overall health and reduce comorbidity through lifestyle modification, particularly since estimates indicate
that only 15-47% of cancer survivors adhere to national guidelines for weight status, diet and physical activity.
While effective interventions in each of these domains exists, there has been little effort to disseminate these
interventions broad scale and to survivors most in need (older, rural, minorities). Moreover, there is a relative
dearth of research in determining optimal means of combining interventions, which is critical since many
survivors practice more than one, or multiple suboptimal behaviors.
 The overarching aims AMPLIFI are to learn how to: 1) improve health behaviors in cancer survivors who
practice multiple suboptimal health behaviors; and 2) adapt efficacious interventions to optimize their reach by
the use of technology among cancer survivors, while also collecting data to inform the future dissemination and
implementation (D&I) potential of these interventions. AMPLIFI involves 3 highly interrelated research projects
supported by 4 highly integrated cores. It will enlist the efforts of 852 survivors of a broad array of cancers that
have favorable 5-year cancer-free survival rates (oversampling those who are older, rural and minority) and
gather the input of 48 key stakeholders to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Understand how to adapt
efficacious interventions for widespread dissemination through the use of technology, while maintaining the
integrity of key components which drive behavior change; 2) Optimize acceptability and use of interventions
(largely developed and tested in homogeneous samples of breast cancer survivors) to older, rural, minority
survivors of many cancer types; 3) Test the efficacy of the adapted interventions delivered alone, in sequence,
or combined; 4) Contribute to the science of D&I research by developing a new adaptation model; and 5)
Determine factors that improve the D&I potential of distance-delivered health behavior change interventions by
determining how they mediate behavior change and in whom they work best. Our ultimate goal is to improve
the health of the highly vulnerable and ever increasing population of cancer survivors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

the past 28 years. Located in the Deep South, an area marked by poverty and health disparities, the CPCTP
provides a critical bridge for students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds who seek research careers
in cancer prevention and control. Currently, 55% of CPCTP trainees are underserved minorities, and 65% are
female. Consonant with NCI's mission to address the nation's behavioral, biomedical, and clinical research
needs for a diverse workforce (PAR-16-152), we seek to transition our CPCTP to a T32 mechanism, so that we
can continue to prepare a diverse pool of highly-trained scientists who have made a major career commitment
to cancer prevention and control research (3 pre- & 3 post-doctoral fellows in years 1-2, and 4- pre & 4- post
doctoral fellows in years 3-5, with a planned duration of 3-years for each appointment). Over 90% of graduates
from our current cycle are actively engaged in research careers showing success. Our proposed T32 adds
many novel components to the CPCTP, while retaining those that have been key to our success, e.g., our
team science multidisciplinary approach and strong team mentorship from 32 faculty who are members of the
Cancer Control and Population Sciences and Cancer Chemoprevention Programs of the UAB Comprehensive
Cancer Center (CCC) - one of the nation's first 7 NCI-designated CCCs. Our efforts are supported by a solid
financial commitment by the UABCCC and our proposed aims are to: 1) recruit, educate, train and evaluate
pre- and postdoctoral fellows from diverse academic disciplines to conduct interdisciplinary research in cancer
prevention and control; 2) recruit a diverse cadre of well-qualified trainees who include members of minority
groups, (i.e., African-Americans, Latinos/ Hispanics, and other disadvantaged groups), and capitalize on UAB's
networks and resources to promote research in health disparities within the framework of cancer prevention
and control; 3)provide a specialized core didactic and tailored research curricula and rich learning opportunities
in cancer prevention and control (e.g., seminars, grant preparation/mock reviews), that complement (not
duplicate) other UAB training programs; 4) foster the development of independent research careers in cancer
prevention and control through mentoring by senior faculty who have established track records in funded
research; 5) further the development of all trainees via additional coursework, additional degrees (i.e., MSPH),
and obtaining independent research fellowships or career awards (e.g., F31/32, K99, DP5); 6) educate our
trainees in the Responsible Conduct of Research and in areas of professional development that will enhance
their future successes in research careers at universities, private institutions, or within the federal government;

1U19AI142759-01,Project 1 - Coronavirus,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are pandemic threats. MERS-CoV
continues to cause new zoonotic and human transmission and illness with ~35% mortality. Currently, there are
no FDA-approved therapies to treat any CoV. New zoonotic CoVs likely will emerge from heterogeneous virus
pools in animal reservoirs, thus requiring antiviral strategies aimed at completely conserved and vulnerable
targets. CoVs rapidly select for resistance to multiple classes of inhibitors, demonstrating the need for
approaches to prevent resistance emergence. Both SARS and MERS infections manifest as severe
immunopathologic damage, potentially limiting the therapeutic window for direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).
Immunomodulation in the absence of antivirals has been shown to not be beneficial and to even exacerbate
SARS and MERS disease. Thus, combinations of DAAs and targeted immunomodulators may be necessary for
effective treatment of established infection. The overall goal of our program is to develop CoV antiviral
strategies that broadly inhibit known and future potential pandemic zoonotic CoVs, prevent emergence
of resistance, and extend the therapeutic window by targeting host immunopathologic responses. The
proposed research will advance preclinical development of the CoV-inhibitory nucleoside analogue EIDD-
1931/2801 and other nucleoside analogues in the pipeline and test two small-molecule hits identified as highly
active against SARS-CoV for treatment and prevention of epidemic and pre-emergent CoVs. In Specific Aim 1,
the spectrum of antiviral activity and therapeutic efficacy of compounds will be defined. The antiviral efficacy,
metabolism, and cytotoxicity of each compound will be determined in cultures of primary human lung cells
targeted by SARS- and MERS-CoV. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of lead compounds will be
evaluated in young, aged, and immunosuppressed murine models of SARS and MERS pathogenesis. In
Specific Aim 2, the mechanism of action of lead compounds and kinetics of drug resistance will be determined.
The antiviral effect of compounds on virus replication, fidelity, and induction of innate immunity will be assessed.
Resistance mutations in genomes of MERS- and SARS-CoV passaged in the presence of increasing
concentrations of drug will be determined by deep sequencing. The impact of resistance on SARS- and MERS-
CoV virulence, sensitivity to other drugs, and therapeutic efficacy of lead compounds will be determined.
Specific Aim 3 will focus on the development of combination regimens for the treatment of emerging CoVs. The
combined therapeutic efficacy of DAAs against infections with both wild-type and drug-resistant SARS- and
MERS-CoV will be defined using cultured cells and mice. The therapeutic effect of treatment combining a DAA
with an immunomodulator will be assessed in mouse models of SARS and MERS. These studies will generate
mechanistic and efficacy data necessary for IND filing and origination of human clinical trials.",,2019,1047304,1023054,24250,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases,Mark R Denison

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The goal of this proposal is to investigate the novel concept that oxidant-modified self-peptides produced by free radical producing myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs) can trigger airway hyper- responsiveness (AHR). We recently characterized MDRCs as critical regulators of airway inflammation in both mice and humans. MDRCs use reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) to enhance T cell proliferation and exacerbate AHR. Our recent studies show that MDRCs induce nitrative and oxidative modifications of self-peptides which are immunogenic neo-antigens for which tolerance has not been established. Consequently, these neo-antigens can elicit pathologic inflammatory responses that represent a novel form of autoimmunity. MDRCs thus are regulators of balance between tolerance and inflammation. In Aim 1, we will identify modified self-antigens/antigenic peptides produced by pro-inflammatory airway MDRCs in asthmatics. We will determine the peptide repertoire bound to HLA-Class II molecules of O2.-- producing airway MDRCs isolated from normal and asthmatic subjects, and define the ROS- and RNS-induced modifications of these self-peptides. These studies will be conducted by eluting the Class II-bound peptides from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) MDRCs, and identifying the nitrative and oxidative modifications of these peptides by mass spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will determine if modified self-proteins presented by ROS- producing MDRCs in asthmatics are true neo-antigens. Peripheral blood T cells and airway MDRCs purified from healthy and asthmatic subjects, and in-vitro modified self-proteins/peptides will be used in functional assays,
limiting dilution analyses and co-cultures to investigate T cell proliferative responses, clonal proliferations and Th polarization. We will use a murine model of asthma to examine molecular mechanisms of MDRC-mediated Th polarization. These studies will provide evidence of a major role for MDRCs as regulators of immune tolerance and inflammation in asthma, and elucidate a new pathogenic paradigm for asthma. Identification of post- translational modified peptide neo-antigens can help define biomarkers to characterize asthma phenotypes. These studies also have the potential to enable development of new and improved therapeutic strategies to target MDRCs for disease control of subsets of asthma phenotypes (i.e., a precision/personalized medicine approach). We will obtain insight for potential novel peptide immunotherapy strategies targeting antigen- specific T cells with novel synthetic peptides representing modified T cell epitopes. .",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will establish myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs) as important regulators of human asthmatic inflammation and help develop therapeutic strategies to target MDRCs for disease control of subsets of asthma phenotypes.

Increased paracellular permeability is a hallmark of acute lung injury and the mechanisms underlying failure of
both epithelial and endothelial barriers need to be further investigated. High morbidity and mortality in patients
with acute lung injury is characterized by flooding of the airspaces with protein-rich edema. We previously
reported that Rho GTPase activation plays a critical role in permeability derangements and actin stress fiber
formation in lung microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Additionally, inhibition of Rho GTPase
preserved the integrity of lung endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier function and promoted alveolar fluid
clearance in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) pneumonia. However, the molecular
downstream mechanism(s) by which Rho GTPases alter cytoskeletal dynamics of lung microvascular
endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells, and causes paracellular permeability derangements, is not fully
understood. Active small Rho GTPase unlocks Neuronal Wiskottâ€“Aldrich syndrome protein (NWASP) from an
autoinhibited conformation for activation. NWASP transmits upstream signals to the cellular machinery directly
involved in modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Our preliminary data and published work indicate that (a)
NWASP downregulation inhibits actin stress fiber formation and reduces paracellular permeability in lung
microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells after exposure to P. aeruginosa or TGF-Î²1; (b)
Furthermore, inhibition of N-WASP protects mice against lung injury and improves survival in a murine model
of P. aeruginosa pneumonia. We hypothesize that activation of the GBD domain of NWASP functions as a
critical switch (the â€œGBD-switchâ€) in the development of lung edema associated with bacteria-induced lung
injury, through recruiting downstream signaling molecules, promoting cytoskeletal dynamics, and disrupting
barrier function of both lung endothelium and alveolar epithelium. To test this hypothesis, we propose three
specific aims: (Aim 1) to define the downstream partner(s), and critical domain(s), of NWASP that are essential
to promote lung microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial permeability induced by P. aeruginosa; (Aim
2) to determine the common, and differential, molecular mechanisms, by which the activated GBD

5R01HL127338-04,The Role of ZFP36 in Control of IPF,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disease. There is no effective therapy that alters mortality or disease progression in IPF so far. ZFP36 is an mRNA-destabilizing protein. ZFP36 expression is significantly decreased in IPF. The role of ZFP36 in lung fibrosis, and the functional consequence of pathologic ZFP36 downregulation in fibrotic reactions, are completely unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that ZFP36 negatively regulates the expression of multiple pro-fibrotic mediators through a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. Decreased ZFP36 expression results in a defective/failed feedback loop to control the pro-fibrotic reactions in IPF lung fibroblasts. Importantly, preliminay data demonstrate that ZFP36-deficient mice have increased lung fibrosis when compared to wild-type mice in response to bleomycin. We hypothesize that ZFP36 functions as a negative regulator of lung fibrosis and pro-fibrotic reactions through a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. We further hypothesize that ZFP36 reduction in IPF results in unbridled expression of pro-fibrotic mediators due to prolonged stability of pro-fibrotic mediator mRNAs. To test our hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 seeks to define the role of ZFP36 in control of the expression of pro-fibrotic mediators and to determine the post-transcriptional mechanism involved. Aim 2 will determine the functional consequence of ZFP36 deficiency in the development of lung fibrosis in vivo, and explore the mechanisms by which ZFP36 controls lung fibrosis in vivo. Aim 3 seeks to determine the molecular mechanism of pathologic ZFP36 downregulation and its consequences in IPF lung fibroblasts. The findings will define the novel role of ZFP36 as a negative regulator of lung fibrosis, and provide new insights about the molecular mechanism by which ZFP36 deficiency promotes pro-fibrotic responses and lung fibrosis.

5K23HD090993-04,A Novel Regimen to Prevent Malaria and STIs in Pregnant Women with HIV,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pregnant women with HIV in Africa have high rates of coinfection with malaria and sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) that contribute to adverse maternal and birth outcomes including stillbirth, preterm delivery,
low birth weight and vertical transmission of HIV. Malaria prophylaxis improves maternal and perinatal
outcomes but current regimens are limited by emerging resistance and serious interactions with medications
that are used in patients with HIV. The identification of a novel drug regimen with dual prevention for both
malaria and curable bacterial STIs in pregnancy would be an important innovation toward improved outcomes
in this vulnerable group of women and infants. To address this pressing problem, this K23 application
describes the background and experience of the applicant, Jodie A. Dionne-Odom, MD and her plan to acquire
the knowledge and training necessary to become an independent, leading scientist in the prevention and
treatment of coinfections in HIV-infected pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Her K23 training objectives
are to: (1) develop expertise in the design and conduct of clinical trials in resource-limited settings (2) gain
advanced training in epidemiology and biostatistics including perinatal epidemiology, drug safety monitoring
and infection modeling techniques; (3) acquire skills in measuring malaria and STI endpoints and (4) gain
additional training in performing human subjects research and grant and manuscript preparation. To meet
these objectives, a comprehensive training plan has been developed in concert with an interdisciplinary team
of mentors and consultants who are established senior research experts. The plan includes hands-on learning,
coursework leading to an MSPH in Clinical and Translational Science and supplemental short courses and
conferences. Equipped with this training, Dr. Dionne-Odom will conduct research to test whether a novel
combination prophylactic regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMPS) and azithromycin (AZ) is superior
to the current standard malaria prophylaxis (TMPS) and whether it has the added benefit of reducing STI
prevalence. In Specific Aim 1, a phase II randomized controlled trial will be performed to test the efficacy of
the combination prophylaxis regimen TMPS-AZ compared to TMPS in HIV-infected pregnant women. The
primary efficacy outcome will be a decrease in the peripheral malaria parasite load at delivery. In Specific Aim
2, the prevalence of treatable bacterial STIs after 35 weeks gestation (or delivery) will be measured and
compared between both arms. In Specific Aim 3, the fetal/neonatal safety and adherence/tolerability of the
combination regimen will be determined. Data from this phase II trial will be used to support an R-01 phase III
multicenter randomized controlled trial in sub-Saharan Africa. The training acquired from this award in
combination with results from this project will facilitate the successful transition of Dr. Dionne-Odom to
research independence and success.","Project Narrative

3R01MH108342-05S1,Effects of NPY on Hippocampal Circuit Function,"Parent Grant Summary: Effects of NPY on Hippocampal Circuit Function (5R01MH180342-04; PI:Dobrunz).
The main objective of the parent grant is to investigate the mechanisms by which the abundantly expressed
neuropeptide, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), modulates hippocampal circuit function to affect anxiety behavior,
potentially leading to new therapeutic targets aimed at increasing NPY release to treat or prevent anxiety. The
overarching hypothesis is that NPY suppresses synaptic plasticity in the temporammonic (TA) pathway to CA1,
and that loss of NPY release in anxiety disorders alters hippocampal circuit function, contributing to maladaptive
learning. Three interrelated specific aims focus on the properties of NPY cells and their inputs that determine
synaptically-evoked spiking and trigger NPY release, effects of endogenously released NPY on excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic transmission and plasticity, and the impact of stress-induced anxiety on endogenous NPY
release at TA-CA1 synapses. Thus far, we have discovered heterogeneity in the properties of NPY cells that
contribute to differences in synaptically-evoked spiking and NPY release, that NPY-containing neurogliaform
cells in distal CA1 act as feed-forward interneurons and have properties that enable robust activation and NPY
release, and that release of NPY dampens synaptic short-term facilitation at TA-CA1 synapses, providing critical
circuit modulation in a pathway that regulates memory consolidation and fear learning. Finally, we discovered
that NPY release is impaired in a rodent model of stress-induced anxiety, altering circuit function. Thus, we have
developed a new experimental paradigm enabling the study of how endogenously released NPY modulates
hippocampal circuits in health and disease states. SUPPLEMENT:NOT- AG-18-039 Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and
its related Dementias (AD/ADRD) NPY levels are reduced in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD), and the
number of NPY+ cells is decreased in postmortem AD hippocampal tissue. NPY has anti-anxiety and anti-
depressant properties, and up to 50% of AD patients have anxiety and/or depression, suggesting a link to
decreased NPY levels. Also relevant is the much greater risk of both AD and anxiety and depression in women,
and importantly, estradiol increases NPY expression and release. Whether NPY release, anxiety and
depression, AD, and heightened risk in females are connected has never been studied. Novel methods for
measuring the effects of endogenously released NPY on hippocampal circuits developed in the PARENT R01
enables an investigation of the effects of NPY on hippocampal circuits in AD. In 2 specific aims, we will test the
hypothesis that NPY levels are reduced in hippocampus of AD rats, and that loss of estrogen exacerbates this
in females, leading to impaired release of NPY and altered hippocampal circuit function. We will leverage our
expertise in studying endogenous NPY release and its effects on synaptic transmission, with the expertise of our
collaborators in AD, sex differences, and in gene regulation, to begin to test this.","Anxiety and depression, which are more prevalent in women, are common in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s
disease (AD); two-thirds of those diagnosed with AD are women, but the cellular mechanisms that
connect disturbances in mood, AD, and increased risk for women are unknown. This proposal will
investigate a potential role for neuropeptide Y (NPY) as the missing link, since NPY expression and
release is regulated by estrogen, NPY levels are decreased in AD patients, and decreased NPY is
associated with heightened anxiety. The results of these studies could demonstrate NPY as a therapeutic
target for treating anxiety and depression in AD, and in particular, in women.",2019,297000,200000,97000,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Depression; Estrogen; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,LYNN E DOBRUNZ
5R01MH108342-05,Effects of NPY on Hippocampal Circuit Function,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an endogenous neuropeptide with robust anxiolytic properties. NPY has been implicated in a wide variety of anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enhancement of NPY levels has been proposed as a potential therapy for PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Low levels of (NPY have been measured in patients with PTSD, and in rodents using the Predator Scent Stress model, which is a model of stress-induced anxiety/PTSD. However, the effect of Predator Scent Stress on NPY release in hippocampus has not yet been demonstrated. Anxiety disorders are considered a maladaptive form of learning, and hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in anxiety disorders and PTSD. Because of its many clinical implications, it is important to understand how the endogenous release of NPY is regulated. In hippocampus, NPY is released from a subset of inhibitory interneurons that also release GABA. Despite the importance of NPY, very little is known about the physiological properties of the interneurons in hippocampus that release NPY. Experiments in this proposal will investigate the synaptically-evoked spiking properties of NPY-containing interneurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus, including the short-term plasticity of their excitatory inputs from Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses from CA3 and temporoammonic (TA) synapses from entorhinal cortex. Exogenous NPY has been shown to modulate glutamate release at SC synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells and to decrease the strength of feed-forward inhibition from SC stimulation. It is not known if NPY modulates TA synapses or TA-induced feed-forward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal cells. We will test the effect of exogenous (bath applied) NPY on the excitation/inhibition ratio and circuit function in CA1 in response to SC and TA stimulation. In addition, the effects on CA1 pyramidal cells of endogenously released NPY will be tested. Finally, we will test for alterations in the release of endogenous NPY in CA1 in a mouse model of anxiety, test for mechanisms underlying the changes, and investigate the effects on CA1 circuit function. These studies will lead to a greater understanding of the regulation of NPY cell spiking and the effects of endogenously released NPY, and may lead to potential therapeutic targets to increase NPY cell spiking and thus raise endogenous levels of NPY.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the activation of neurons in hippocampus that release Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which has anxiolytic properties and has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. It will also determine the effects of NPY on synaptic and circuit function, develop a novel assay for showing effects of endogenously released NPY, and test for alterations in NPY release in an animal model of anxiety. These experiments may lead to new therapeutic targets to increase endogenous NPY levels to treat anxiety disorders.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Anxiety Disorders; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),LYNN E DOBRUNZ
3R01AI083255-10S1,Mechanism of prolate cos phage capsid size redirection by S. aureus pathogenicity islands,"Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen involved in severe infections in
humans. S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are mobile genetic elements that carry genes
encoding superantigen toxins and other virulence factors, and are mobilized at high frequency
by specific â€œhelperâ€ bacteriophages. Many SaPIs redirect the assembly pathway of their helpers
to form capsids that are smaller than those normally made by the phage.
 This request is for a diversity supplement to R01 AI083255 (parent grant) to support Ms.
N'Toia Hawkins, a graduate student in my lab who is currently funded by a UAB diversity
fellowship that expires in July 2019. The parental R01 project is focused on understanding the
mobilization and size redirection process for one class of SaPIsâ€”including SaPI1 and
SaPIbov1â€”that are mobilized by headful packaging helper phages with isometric capsids, such
as 80Î±. We recently described a new class of SaPIs (including SaPIbov5) that are mobilized by
prolate cos phages, such as Ï†12. The mechanism of capsid size redirection is completely
different from the SaPIs that are mobilized by headful packaging phages, and depends on a
SaPI-encoded capsid protein (CP) homolog called Ccm. The overall objective of the N'Toia's
project is to understand the mechanism of Ccm-mediated capsid size redirection and, more
broadly, the mobilization of cos type SaPIs. We propose to incorporate this project as a
supplemental aim to the parent R01 with N'Toia taking the lead, with funding from the proposed
diversity supplement. The supplement project has three specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine structures of Ï†12 (large) and SaPIbov5 (small) capsids
Aim 2: Identify the location of Ccm in SaPIbov5 capsids
Aim 3: Define the role of the CP and Ccm N-terminal domains in the size redirection process
 These aims will be addressed by a combination of genetics, biochemistry, cryo-EM and
three-dimensional reconstruction approaches, and will lead to new insights into the process of
prolate phage assembly and genetic mobilization in S. aureus. Furthermore, the project will
serve as an excellent vehicle for Ms. Hawkins' training and development into an independent
scientist and to help her reach her career goals.","The emergence of virulent, antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus has become a

2R01AI083255-10,Structural basis for mobilization of S. aureus pathogenicity islands,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen involved in severe infections in
humans. Most virulence determinants in S. aureus are carried on mobile genetic elements
(MGEs), such as plasmids, bacteriophages and genomic islands. Transduction by
bacteriophages (phages) represents the main mechanism by which MGEs are transmitted
horizontally in S. aureus. Among these MGEs are the S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs),
which carry genes encoding superantigen toxins and other virulence factors. SaPIs are normally
stably integrated into the host genome, but become mobilized at high frequency by specific
helper phages, resulting in packaging of the SaPI genomes into transducing particles made
from helper-encoded structural proteins. SaPIs have evolved the ability to sense the presence
of a lytic phage, exploit phage functions and interfere with phage multiplication, in order to
promote their own dissemination. SaPIs this play important roles in S. aureus evolution and
pathogenicity.
 The overall aim of the current project is to understand the structural basis for SaPI
mobilization, helper-SaPI specificity, and the factors involved in their spread and establishment.
Our specific aims are: (1) Determine the mechanism of SaPI-induced capsid size redirection; (2)
Understand the function of the phage baseplate in infection and host specificity; (3) Elucidate
the role of minor capsid protein gp44 in the lytic/lysogenic switch.
 These three aims focus on different aspects of the mobilization process and will be studied
by a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural methods. All three aims are based on a
solid premise set by our previous studies and extensive preliminary data. Upon completion of
these aims, we will have gained new insights into the process of capsid assembly and size
redirection, the infection and transfer process, the mechanisms by which SaPIs and their
virulence factors are transmitted and established in the bacterial population.","RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH

5I01CX001434-03,Surgical Studies on the Role of MicroRNAs in Esophageal Cancer,"Background: Despite significant reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy,
survival for patients with esophageal cancer remains dismal. In most patients, adjunctive therapies including
chemotherapy and radiation are beneficial. In fact, patients who achieve a complete pathologic response
(pCR) after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation followed by esophagectomy often experience greatly
improved survival. Unfortunately, the percentage of patients who currently achieve a pCR is low. Improving
survival for esophageal cancer patients following esophagectomy requires that we ascertain how to increase
the number of patients who achieve a pCR. In other malignancies, microRNAs (miRs) have been found to
serve as effective diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In addition, based on their ability to
function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, miR-based therapeutic approaches are currently being
investigated. The role of miRs in the pathogenesis and treatment of esophageal cancer has not been
thoroughly evaluated.
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets based an
analysis of miR expression and function in esophageal cancer cells.
Preliminary Findings: Our preliminary studies indicate that a) miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p are dramatically
downregulated in esophageal cancer cell lines compared to esophageal epithelial cells, b) this expression
pattern has been verified in initial human tumor samples, c) specific binding interactions have been identified
between miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p with the oncogenic targets survivin and mitogen activated protein
kinase kinase kinase 11 (MAP3K11), respectively, d) ectopic expression of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p
results in a marked decrease in the levels of survivin and MAP3K11 in esophageal cancer cells, and e) ectopic
expression of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p results in important functional consequences; specifically,
increased sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation, respectively. Based on
these exciting observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that downregulation of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p occurs
frequently in esophageal cancer cells and can be exploited for prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic
purposes.
Methods: To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. (1) To characterize expression of miR-
214-3p and miR-199a-5p in human esophageal cancer specimens and correlate expression with clinical
outcomes. Pretreatment biopsies of both tumor and normal esophageal epithelium will be obtained from 50
patients for evaluation of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p expression and correlation with outcomes. (2) To
identify novel targets of miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p that contribute to the development and progression of
esophageal cancer. We will utilize human esophageal cancer cell lines to identify new targets and functions of
miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p in esophageal cancer cells. (3) To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of
miR-214-3p and miR-199a-5p overexpression in vivo. Human esophageal cancer cell lines will be engineered
to stably express selected miR-214-3p or miR-199a-5p. These engineered cells will then be implanted in nude
mice. Their growth characteristics and response to chemotherapy will be compared to wild-type cells.
Status: This is a resubmission.
Impact: The incidence of esophageal cancer continues to increase in the Untied Sates, especially in males
over the age of 50. Based on these demographics, this disease represents a significant problem in the VA
healthcare system. Improving outcomes for esophageal cancer patients will greatly enhance the ability of the
VA to fulfill its healthcare mission.","Despite significant reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with esophagectomy, survival for

The Research Programming & Computational Analysis (RPCA) Core was redesigned in 2013 as a result of
strategic task realignment within the existing P30 Core Grant to better align tasks previously performed in the
Computer Core with current and emerging research needs. This re-alignment was brought about because of
the increasing complexity of digital data, particularly laboratory-generated images in vision research, and the
need to develop custom analysis routines to process, summarize and quantify those data. Custom image
analysis and processing routines in particular are an increasingly critical component of vision research,
particularly with the emergence of several new clinical and research imaging modalities such as conventional
and adaptive optics optical coherence tomography imaging and volumetric microscopy techniques. In addition,
a vast array of research data is now digital, necessitating the development of custom data management,
filtering, and quantification schemes through research programming. The second longstanding primary function
of the RPCA Core is to develop custom software interfaces for control of and data acquisition from new and
existing research equipment. Much of this equipment is developed in house through collaborations with the
Instrumentation Core, and custom software interfaces are a mainstay of instrument development,
implementation, and data acquisition. Custom programming for data analysis and instrument interfaces is out
of the reach of most investigators due to the high cost of competent programmers and the relatively limited
need within individual projects. The third goal of this Core is to provide a full array of biostatistical services to
P30 participants. The goal of this realigned Core is to offer researchers a comprehensive programming and
computational data analysis service where custom analysis routines and stand-alone programs can be
developed for individual project needs by highly trained personnel. This realigned Core anticipates moderate to
extensive use from 9 of the 11 NEI R01-funded investigator/participants.",,2019,175567,119229,56338,Research Centers,P30,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Bioengineering; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Neurosciences,J CRAWFORD DOWNS
5R01EY026035-04,IOP and OPP Fluctuation as Risk Factors for Glaucoma,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intraocular pressure (IOP) and age were found to be the most consistent independent risk factors for development and progression of glaucoma in all of the major prospective clinical trials, even though IOP has not been shown to increase with age in most populations. Glaucoma is also much more prevalent in persons of African ancestry. Lowering IOP is the only clinical treatment that has been shown to retard the onset and progression of glaucoma, but once damaged, the optic nerve head (ONH) is thought to be more susceptible to further glaucomatous progression even after clinical intervention has lowered mean IOP to `normal' levels. We have previously interpreted these findings to mean that the ONH is increasingly vulnerable to glaucomatous injury with advancing age, African ancestry, and prior damage. There is a plausible alternative explanation, however. Our telemetric IOP data show that the eye is subjected to about 7,000 IOP spikes >5 mmHg per hour during waking hours. Also, IOP spikes >1 mmHg above baseline are responsible for up to 15% of the total IOP insult the eye must absorb during waking hours on average. This is an extraordinary finding, in that IOP spikes represent a previously unknown and potentially highly injurious component of the IOP total insult that has yet to be characterized or considered in previous animal or clinical studies.  We hypothesize that greater IOP and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) fluctuation independently contribute to the onset and progression of glaucoma in addition to mean IOP. We will test this organizing hypothesis by elucidating the age- and disease-related changes in IOP, OPP, and their fluctuations as they relate to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon loss and elevated IOP-induced ocular coat stiffening.  Support for the ""fluctuation"" hypothesis would lead to an entirely new understanding of the importance of IOP and OPP fluctuation in the increased age- and disease-related susceptibility to glaucoma and provide strong rationale for totally new clinical diagnosis and treatment modalities that employ IOP and OPP fluctuation reduction through modification of ocular coats stiffness or intraocular damping of IOP fluctuations. If our results do not support the ""fluctuation"" hypothesis, the knowledge we gain about the natural fluctuations of these variables will redefine the appropriate IOP measurement frequency in patients and inform patient care.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We hypothesize there are unknown age- and disease-related components of intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), such as greater IOP and OPP fluctuation, that independently contribute to the onset and progression of glaucoma.

5R01EY027924-02,Optic Nerve Head Mechanobiology in Glaucoma,"ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the developed world. Alterations in optic nerve head
(ONH) biomechanics and pathologic remodeling of associated connective tissues in the lamina cribrosa (LC)
and scleral are thought to be important in glaucomatous retinal ganglion cell axonal damage and vision loss.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, although vision loss can
occur at normal IOP. IOP is a stress that imparts strain to the ONH. The role that mechanical strain and the
underlying cellular mechanotransduction pathways play in pathologic connective tissue remodeling of the ONH
and sclera in glaucoma remain poorly understood, however. Our central hypothesis is that cellular-level strain,
modulated by laminar and scleral tissue stiffness, drives mechanotransduction responses that cause
pathologic alterations in the ONH and scleral connective tissue/extracellular matrix (ECM) and lead to axonal
death. Furthermore, we propose that these factors underlie the variability in glaucoma susceptibility and
progression at all IOP levels. The goals of this proposal are to 1) to identify the biomechanical factors that
contribute to glaucoma susceptibility, and 2) identify the biomechanical and molecular determinants of
mechanically-induced cellular responses and connective tissue remodeling in glaucoma. To achieve this goal,
we will use a unilateral, inducible animal model of glaucoma with identical IOP endpoints, and human donor
eyes. In Aim 1, we will identify biomechanical risk factors for glaucoma and determine remodeling-induced
alterations in morphology and mechanical responses of the LC and sclera using optical coherence tomography
and 3D reconstructions. We will also determine the effect of chronic elevated IOP on
mechanotransduction/ECM remodeling pathways in tissues and cells harvested from this model at a defined
IOP insult and correlate this activity with changes in scleral/ONH material properties and axon loss. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether the pathways identified in the animal model are similarly regulated clinical records-
verified normal and glaucomatous human donor eyes. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanical environment
that stimulates tissue remodeling using eye specific, multi-scale 3D computational models of eyes. These
studies will lead to identification of both biomechanical factors and cellular mechanotransduction pathways that
contribute to scleral/ONH ECM remodeling and glaucoma pathogenesis, with the goal of identifying new
therapeutic targets.","Project Narrative

from these studies will drive future development of therapeutics aimed at modulating the structural

5UH3TR002450-03,AZD9688: A First in Class Disease Modifying Therapy to Treat Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency a Genetically Linked Orphan Disease,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and emphysema and affects between 70,000-100,000 individuals in the United States.
Individuals with AATD have extremely low plasma and lung levels of AAT, a serine protease inhibitor that
inactivates neutrophil elastase (NE) and other proteases to maintain protease-antiprotease balance in the lung.
In the absence of AAT, NE activity is unchecked leading to accelerated elastin degradation, progressive
damage to the extracellular matrix, and causing early-onset emphysema. Desmosine and isodesmosine
(DES), markers of NE-mediated elastolysis, can be measured in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
fluid, correlate with lung function, and can be modified by AAT augmentation therapy which currently forms the
mainstay of AATD treatment. While AAT augmentation therapy may slow emphysema progression, data is not
definitive and the therapy is costly and burdensome. Direct inhibition of NE, the mediator of lung injury,
represents a more direct approach. AZD9668 is a potent, selective, and orally available NE inhibitor that was
developed as treatment for pulmonary diseases characterized by increased protease activity. In Phase 2

cystic fibrosis, and improved inflammatory markers in a subset of non-AATD COPD patients without raising
any safety concerns. We hypothesize that AZD9668 will block NE activity in the lungs and plasma of AATD
patients and thus reduce DES levels in both compartments and that the drug will be safe and well tolerated.
We will test this through the following specific aims:
UG3 Phase: 1. To finalize the study protocol and manual of procedures, establish the coordinating center and
the electronic database system, execute clinical site contracts, gain IRB approvals for the phase II study, and
apply for and receive approval of an investigator initiated IND for AZD9668 in AATD from the FDA. UH3
Phase: 2a. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AZD9668 120mg bid in a 12-week randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial in patients with AATD and COPD. The co-primary endpoints will be the
reduction in elastin degradation and NE activity as measured by DES in plasma and the safety and tolerability
of AZD9668. Secondary endpoints include lung function, health status, and dyspnea as well as additional
measurements of NE activity, elastolysis, and inflammation in blood and BAL. 2b. To determine the utility of
baseline plasma and BAL DES as a biomarker of AZD9668 response in patients with AATD.

if successful will set the stage to further develop this paradigm shifting oral therapeutic strategy.","Project Narrative
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and early-onset emphysema, and AATD is characterized by low AAT levels, leading to
excessive neutrophil elastase (NE) mediated lung destruction. Current treatment requires the periodic infusion
of pooled AAT derived from human plasma, but this therapeutic approach does not definitively slow the rate of
emphysema progression and is very expensive with annual direct costs over $100,000 per patient. We
propose to study the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AZD9668, an orally available NE-inhibitor, in patients
with AATD.",2019,1815951,1599681,350357,Non-SBIR/STTR,UH3,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Emphysema; Lung; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases,Inmaculada  Aban; MARK T DRANSFIELD

which accounts for over $40 billion in annual healthcare costs, is the 3rd leading cause of death 
in the U.S., and is major source of health disparity, being over-represented in the Deep South. 
Like cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD is characterized by mucus obstruction that is associated with 
accelerated loss of lung function and excess mortality. Cigarette smoke exhibits a variety of 
deleterious effects on airway epithelial function in vitro and in vivo and our preliminary data 
indicates it also causes a significant reduction in CFTR activity that leads to a pronounced 
decrement in mucociliary transport. Furthermore, CFTR dysfunction is independently associated 
with chronic bronchitis and dyspnea, can persist despite smoking cessation, and can be 
reversed by the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro and in vivo by activating wild-type CFTR, 
resulting in a robust increase in mucociliary transport. Combined with unprecedented clinical 
improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance observed in CF patients with a responsive 
CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor, these data indicate that CFTR represents a viable 
therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis (potentially 
representing over 8 million patients in the U.S. alone). In this project, we will investigate the 
hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with COPD who exhibit 
chronic bronchitis. Though our preliminary data are compelling, questions regarding the most 
informative and responsive endpoints and dose selection mandate the studies outlined in this 
application. To address this, we have designed an innovative Phase 2, Randomized, Double- 
blind, Placebo Controlled Pilot Trial to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Ivacaftor (VX-770) 
for the Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (The Multicenter TOPIC study), 
and will address a number of key questions to the field of COPD and airway epithelial biology 
using the latest methods for assessing CFTR activity, epithelial function, mucociliary clearance, 
and clinical outcomes. The TOPIC study will test whether MCC can be augmented in COPD 
patients with chronic bronchitis, ameliorating human disease even in the absence of congenital 
mutations in the CFTR gene. The trial will provide an initial proof of concept evaluating the 
efficacy of CFTR potentiators in COPD, and we will also examine differential effects based on 
race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and smoking status. If successful, the results could 
establish a novel treatment paradigm to address mucus dysfunction in COPD, an important 
cause of morbidity that is independently associated with mortality and disease progression.","Narrative

5K24HL140108-02,UAB Mentoring Program in COPD Patient Oriented Research,"ABSTRACT
COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States and has major public health impacts. Current
treatments can improve symptoms but none prevent disease progression or reduce mortality. This is in part
due to the high burden of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, which complicate diagnosis and
treatment. COPD-associated cardiovascular disease has not been adequately studied but may provide
avenues to improve clinical outcomes. There are currently no proven therapies for COPD-related pulmonary
vascular disease despite numerous trials testing vasodilators in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.
Conduct of these studies has been hampered by the lack of a non-invasive measure of pulmonary pressure
and no tools adequately detect early pulmonary vascular abnormalities. We have developed a novel, non-
invasive, cardiac MRI measure of pulmonary artery impedance (the velocity transfer function) that may prove
useful in the identification and quantification of COPD-associated pulmonary vascular disease. Specific Aim 1
of this proposal is to determine whether the velocity transfer function can identify abnormalities in pulmonary
arterial impedance in COPD and whether it correlates with right ventricular function. It is also well established
that beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease, but COPD patients are often denied
these medications because of concerns about adverse effects of beta-blockade on airway function. Multiple
observational studies now indicate that beta-blockers may in fact reduce exacerbation risk in COPD and the
multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, Beta-Blocker for the Prevention of COPD Exacerbations (BLOCK-
COPD) trial is underway to test this hypothesis. Regardless of the results, questions will remain about the risk-
benefit of beta-blockers in patients with COPD, including their effects on exercise. Specific Aim 2 of this
proposal is to determine the effect of metoprolol on peak exercise as assessed by cycle ergometry in patients
with COPD. This proposal also aims to provide mentoring and training opportunities to new investigators
pursuing COPD Patient-Oriented Research (POR). Mentoring will be tailored to meet the interests and
objectives of individual trainees but a core set of topics will be presented through one-on-one and group
sessions. Specialized training in biostatistics as well as research applications of quantitative thoracic CT and
cardiac MRI will also be provided. Trainees will also take advantage of career development programs offered
by the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science. The proposal also aims to provide the PI with formal
mentoring training as well as research training in comparative effectiveness and health services methodology
which will open new avenues for his own investigative career as well as additional opportunities for trainees.
The K24 will contribute significantly to the PI's long term career objectives to 1) extend our understanding of
cardiopulmonary interactions in COPD; 2) conduct high impact POR to transform care for patients with the
disease; and 3) help train the next generation of investigators planning careers in COPD POR.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is now the third leading cause of death in the United States

5R01EY025331-05,Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor adherence to glaucoma therapy is a significant healthcare issue that may result in unwarranted changes in medications, increased healthcare expenditure, risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required and further deterioration of vision, all of which can be prevented. This can subsequently have a negative impact on an individual's quality life, independence, and everyday living. The multifaceted and culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention, lacking in this area, is designed to take critical steps toward addressing this problem by motivating change for healthy lifestyle behaviors and improving problem-solving strategies to better manage barriers related to glaucoma medication adherence, particularly among African American patients who are at greater risk for glaucoma and poor adherence compared to Caucasians.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Patient Safety; Prevention,LAURA E DREER
1F31HL149235-01,HDAC1 Regulation of Endothelial NO,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Excess sodium intake accounts for billions of healthcare dollars every year. In 2010, 1.65 million deaths
from cardiovascular disease were attributed to a high salt diet. Furthermore, sodium intake directly correlates
with kidney function and mortality. A high salt diet causes cardiovascular and renal damage by increasing
oxidative stress and impairing endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. The mechanisms by which a high salt diet
leads to NOS3 uncoupling and increased NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) expression and activity remains elusive.
NOS3 uncoupling is characterized by an increase in NOS-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a
decrease in NOS-dependent NO. The central hypothesis to the proposed studies is that high salt increases
endothelial HDAC1 which uncouples NOS3 via post-translational modification (deacetylation) and increases
Nox2 expression and activity via a transcriptional mechanism. In order to study the role of HDAC1 in NOS3
uncoupling, intra-renal arteries and renal endothelial cells will be isolated from normal and high salt fed rats.
HDAC1 activity as well as HDAC1 dependence of NOS3 uncoupling and NOS3 acetylation will be assessed. We
will generate vascular endothelial HDAC1 knockout (VEHDAC1KO) mice to investigate the necessity of HDAC1
in high salt disrupted NO signaling. The juxtamedullary nephron preparation will be used to assess NO signalling
in small intra-renal arteries. In order to identify which NOS3 lysines are susceptible to HDAC1 deacetylation, we
will utilize NOS3 constructs containing specific lysine (K) to arginine (R) or glutamine (Q) mutations. Cdh5-
CreERT2-Nox2KO mice will be used to assess the role of endothelial Nox2 in high salt disrupted NO signaling
in small intra-renal arteries. We will use VEHDAC1KO mice to elucidate the role of HDAC1 in high salt increased
Nox2 complex expression. ChIP-qPCR will be utilized to assess the effect of HDAC1 on histone modifications at
the promoters of the genes of the Nox2 complex. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the role of
HDAC1 in endothelial NO signaling in order to develop novel therapies for cardiovascular disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
High salt intake contributes a substantial burden to human health. High salt induced cardiovascular and renal
damage is in part mediated by decreased bioavailability of endothelial nitric oxide and increases the risk of future
cardiovascular complications. This project aims to elucidate new drug targets by investigating the in-depth
mechanisms by which a high salt diet decreases endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability.",2019,38282,38282,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Genetics; Nutrition,Luke Stewart Dunaway
5U01HL133232-03,Autoantibody-Targeted Therapy for Acute Exacerbations of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Some patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive fibroproliferative lung disease of
older adults, develop sudden acute exacerbations (AE-IPF) that can result in respiratory failure and death
within days. Steroids are standard treatment for AE-IPF, although these and all other medical therapies tried
to date have been ineffectual. Findings of our research group, as well as others, show that numerous
immune abnormalities that are identical to conventional autoantibody-mediated syndromes are also common
in IPF patients, especially among those who are having or will soon have acute exacerbations.
 An autoimmune pathogenesis could also explain the refractoriness of AE-IPF to current therapy, since
many conventional autoantibody-mediated lung diseases are also resistant to treatment with steroids and
other nonspecific agents. However, regimens that specifically reduce preexisting autoantibodies, deplete
autoantibody-producing B-cells, and/or inhibit B-cell autoantibody production are more often beneficial for
these syndromes.
 We have conducted a proof-of-concept pilot trial in which seriously-ill AE-IPF patients were treated with
therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to very rapidly reduce circulating autoantibodies, plus rituximab to
deplete autoantibody-producing B-cells, plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to further inhibit auto-
antibody production. In comparisons to a historical control group, these autoantibody reduction therapies
resulted in unprecedented clinical responses in most AE-IPF patients.
 Accordingly, we hypothesize: AUTOANTIBODY REDUCTION IS BENEFICIAL FOR AE-IPF PATIENTS.
 We propose here a randomized Phase IIb clinical trial to test this hypothesis by comparing efficacy of
TPE plus rituximab plus IVIG vs. treatment as usual (TAU) for AE-IPF patients. After providing informed
consent, subjects hospitalized for AE-IPF at five participating medical centers will be randomized (2:1) to
either the experimental arm or TAU, respectively. The primary endpoint of this trial is six-month survival.
Secondary endpoints include changes in requirements for supplemental oxygen and six-minute walk
distances, as well as adverse events rates. We anticipate this innovative experimental treatment will result
in improved survival, lesser oxygen requirements, greater functional capacities, and an acceptable toxicity
profile. Additional translational studies will examine the potential clinical use of autoantibody assays in AE-
IPF patients.
 Results of this investigation could substantially alter treatment approaches, and save the lives of future
patients who have this rapidly progressive and too-often lethal lung disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Some patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) develop very rapid and often lethal
progressions of their lung disease, called acute exacerbations, which we believe are due to the

treated with the usual medications for this syndrome. The results of this trial could show

5P01HL114470-07,Phase II Clinical Trial of the Safety and Efficacy if a NOX1/4 Inhibitor in IPF,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a morbid fibroproliferative lung disease of older adults that causes
progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia. Current treatments for IPF are only partly efficacious, and often have
unacceptable side-effects. Development of a safe, effective IPF therapy would be a major advance.
 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidases (NOX) play an important role in the
development of fibrosis. Investigations during Cycle 1 of this tPPG showed that inhibition of NOX4 with a
small molecule pharmaceutical (GKT137831) decreased the severity of the pulmonary abnormality and
improved survival in an animal model of persistent fibrosis. GKT137831 treatment also reduces ROS
production and decreases ECM production in other animal models of liver, kidney, and cardiac fibrosis.
Importantly, GKT137831 has a good safety profile in early phase human trials for other indications.
 Other studies conducted during Cycle I of this tPPG showed that o,oâ€™-dytyrosine, which is a ROS-induced
covalent modification of protein-tyrosine residues, was increased 18-fold in the plasma of IPF patients
relative to healthy controls. ECM turnover is also a fundamental process in IPF pathogenesis, and increases
in the circulating products of collagen digestions by matrix metalloproteinases, including the neoepitope
C1M, were recently shown to predict lung disease progression in IPF patients.
 We hypothesize that treatment with the NOX1/4 inhibitor GKT137831 will reduce oxidative injury in IPF
patients, and propose here a pilot study to test this hypothesis.
 The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a double-blinded Phase IIB clinical trial in 60 ambulatory IPF
subjects at five major medical centers. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to GKT137831 or placebo, and
treated for six months. The primary endpoint of this trial will be treatment effects on o,o'-dityrosine plasma
levels, measured pretreatment, and at six week intervals. We hypothesize GKT137831 therapy will reduce
plasma levels of o,o'-tyrosine, reflecting a drug-induced reduction of ROS injury.
 Specific Aim 2 will determine effects of GKT137831 compared to placebo, on a.) Collagen degradation
product C1M concentrations in sera; b.) Forced vital capacities; c.) Six-minute walk distances; and d.)
Adverse event (AE) rates. We hypothesize GKT137831 therapy will decrease C1M, and have an acceptable
AE profile. The clinical measures will facilitate detection of an unprecedented benefit of this novel approach.
 This highly innovative clinical trial could provide evidence that selective NOX inhibition is safe and
beneficial in IPF patients. Results of this study will help to confirm and establish methods, and provide the
rationale that will facilitate and justify subsequent definitive trials to evaluate the clinical benefits of NOX
inhibitors in IPF. This research has the potential to be paradigm-shifting, will fill several existing gaps, and
could ultimately extend the lives of many future patients.","The placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase IIb trial proposed here will test GKT137831, an
inhibitor of the NAPDH enzyme NOX4, in 60 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at five

decreases oxidative stress and other indicators of pulmonary fibrosis. This research has the
potential to be a significant advance in the treatment of IPF, and could prolong the lives of

5U54CA118948-14,Project 1:,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
African Americans (AAs) are more likely to develop and die from cancer than any racial and ethnic group in the
United States (U.S.). Over the past two decades, there has been an increased focus on participation of AAs in
cancer clinical trials (CCTs) to address this disproportionate burden of cancer; however AAs continue to be
underrepresented in CCTs. The dearth of AAs participating in CCTs diminishes the generalizability of results of
trials. If AAs remain underrepresented in CCTs, the implications include slower progress in elucidating the
underlying causes of long-standing health disparities in cancer outcomes. There is an extensive body of
science detailing trial participation barriers among AAs, including limited access to specialty care centers
where trials are conducted, competing work obligations, and fear and mistrust of clinical research. Despite
these barriers, AAs are, inherently, no less willing to participate in CCTs or other types of research studies than
other racial or ethnic groups. The absence of differences in willingness to participate suggests that persistent
disparities in accrual may, in fact, be due to AAs being offered fewer opportunities than whites to participate in
CCTs. Although many interventions have focused on approaches to increase the willingness of AAs to
participate, perhaps efforts should be focused on increasing the opportunities among AAs to participate in
CCTs. We propose to adapt the IMPaCT patient navigation model and pilot a clinical trials navigator program,
IMPaCT 2.0, at Morehouse Healthcare (MH) and Grady Hospital (Grady), one of the largest safety-net
hospitals in the nation. We propose to enhance the patient navigation model with a mobile tablet-based clinical
trial tracking system (CTTS) (using i2b2 software) to facilitate increased engagement among AA patients
regarding CCT participation opportunities and to address deficits in the research infrastructure at these two
institutions. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we will identify those barriers and facilitators to AA recruitment at
MH/Grady (Specific Aim 1) and incorporate those findings into an adapted clinical trials navigation (CTN)
model with an integrated mobile tablet CTTS (Specific Aim 2)., We will implement IMPaCT 2.0 at MH/Grady

The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee University, and The
University of Alabama, working together to recruit minority investigators, provide education in aging and health
disparities research, guide career development through collaborative mentoring, and sustain progress to
successful, independent research careers. The research focus of the Deep South RCMAR is on reducing
health disparities between African American (AA) and White older adults in the Deep South, the region of the
country where the majority of older AAs live and health disparities have been particularly persistent. We focus
on health problems particularly prevalent among older AAs in our region and for which disparities have been
identified in both rural and urban settings. Our specific aims are to: (1) identify, engage, and mentor
outstanding faculty under-represented in academia who are committed to academic careers in aging and
health disparities research; (2) provide high quality research education and individualized career
development support; (3) support innovative, high impact pilot projects that will advance the science of
minority aging and health disparities; (4) provide expertise and resources for working collaboratively with
communities in areas of interest to them and in the recruitment and retention of older AAs in research; (5)
provide expertise and resources for study design, culturally sensitive measurement, data analysis, and
access to databases for secondary analysis; and (6) disseminate to scientific, professional and lay audiences
research results addressing the reduction of health disparities through the improvement of minority health,
particularly for older AAs. We propose continuation and enhancements of the cores established during the
first two funding cycles: the Research Education Component (formerly the Investigator Development Core),
the Administrative Core, the Analysis Core, and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core. Over the
next five years, we will fund at least 15 pilot projects; provide research education through our inter-disciplinary
Health Disparities Research Education Program; and assist RCMAR Scientists to obtain career development
or independent research grants. With renewal of the Deep South RCMAR, we also propose innovations in
each core to enhance our overall program effectiveness in recruiting minority investigators, providing
education in aging and heath disparities research, guiding career development through collaborative
mentoring, and sustaining their progress to successful, independent research careers. In these ways, the

5R01DK106041-04,Primary Care Obesity Management in the Southeast_PROMISE,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary care offers a familiar and accessible clinical venue for patients affected by obesity to receive evidence- based lifestyle interventions for weight management. However, there are numerous barriers to the implementation of such programs in primary care, and previous interventions delivered by primary care physicians or other members of the healthcare team have often demonstrated modest and temporary weight loss for patients. Weight loss treatment delivered by trained peer coaches may offer a viable and effective alternative to address weight management in primary care. While peer coaches have successfully delivered behavioral interventions for other chronic conditions (e.g., type 2 diabetes) as well as obesity interventions in non-clinical settings (e.g., community centers), research is lacking on the effectiveness of translating peer- delivered weight loss interventions to primary care. Our preliminary work suggests that a weight loss intervention delivered in primary care by peer coaches can achieve clinically significant reductions in weight, is feasible for adoption in primary care, and is well-received by patients. In this application, we propose to conduct an 18-month randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of obesity treatment that includes either: 1) in-person and telephone-based contacts with peer coaches (peer coach treatment), or 2) routine contact with a primary care provider plus self-directed intervention materials (standard care). This weight loss trial will include 375 obese adults randomized from 10 primary care practices. The primary outcome will be changes in body weight at month 18. Secondary outcomes will include key patient-centered outcomes, including quality-of-life, physical and social functioning, mood, and treatment satisfaction. The cost- effectiveness of the peer coach intervention will also be evaluated. This is a novel investigation of the effectiveness and sustainability of an innovative alternative for obesity treatment delivery in primary care. If the peer coach intervention proves effective, it would have significant clinical and public health implications for patients, clinicians, and health systems. These potential benefits include: 1) improvement of clinical and psychosocial outcomes for patients, 2) increased treatment options for primary care providers to manage the care of obese patients, and 3) reduced healthcare utilization and costs.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a significant public health concern, and previous efforts to address obesity in primary care have had limited success.

to delivery. Even if offered, many patients do not have the time or resources to participate. Given this, along
with the challenges of losing weight and keeping it off, a harm reduction framework focused on disrupting
continued age-related weight gain among primary care patients with obesity may be a strategy to mitigate
obesity's adverse health effects. Self-regulation theory suggests that daily self-weighing (DSW; i.e., instruction
to weigh daily and monitor weight) offers a simple way to promote weight management among patients with
obesity. We, and others, have shown that DSW associates with better weight management and may be ideal
for primary care because of its low-burden and consistency with clinical guidelines recommending self-
monitoring of health parameters such as blood pressure and glucose. However, DSW's effect when
implemented in primary care among adults with obesity is unknown. Therefore, we propose conducting SWOP
(Daily Self-Weighing for Obesity Management in Primary Care), a 24-month randomized controlled trial
(RCT) in 400 adults with obesity (i.e., body mass index [BMI]: kg/m2 â‰¥30) receiving primary care through a
clinical network affiliated with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Enrolled participants will receive
weight management educational materials and then randomized to DSW or standard care (SC). DSW will
involve provision of a web-enabled digital scale with graphical weight feedback, while SC will involve routine
care. We will test the causal effect of assignment to DSW on weight (primary outcome) and self-initiated
adoption of weight management practices (secondary outcomes) over 24 months (Aim 1). We will also test the
causal effect of DSW adherence on weight and weight control practices (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the
cost effectiveness of DSW compared to SC (Aim 3). Results will allow us to estimate whether DSW mitigates
continued age-related weight gain among adults with obesity. If so, DSW could have substantial public health
and economic effects by offering a weight management strategy that is feasible to implement in primary care.","RELEVANCE
Many adults with obesity continue to gain weight even though they do not want to. This project will test the
effects of a primary care intervention in which people with obesity receive an electronic scale and
recommendations to weigh themselves daily. This will help us understand whether daily self-weighing might be
a way to prevent continued weight gain.",2019,544735,395430,149305,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Health Services; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention,Gareth R Dutton; KEVIN R FONTAINE
5R01DK103863-05,Fixed Versus Variable Energy Reduction During Behavioral Obesity Treatment,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral interventions for obesity include prescribed energy reduction (ER) to promote weight loss, and these ER levels typically remain unchanged during the weight loss phase of treatment. While more stringent ER (e.g., >1,000 kcal/d deficit) produces greater and more rapid weight loss, such deficits are more difficult to follow and sustain over time than are moderate ER (e.g., ~500 kcal/d deficit). However, research is lacking on the efficacy of different ERs that alternate individuals between discrete episodes of stringent and moderate ER during obesity treatment. While varying ER during obesity treatment has not been rigorously evaluated, doing so may have psychological and behavioral advantages (increased novelty, engagement) as well as metabolic benefits (attenuated changes in resting metabolic rate and appetite-regulating hormones). Preliminary evidence also suggests: 1) variable ER produced significant short-term weight loss that was greater than losses achieved with a fixed ER, 2) adherence to the variable ER was good, and 3) participants expressed positive attitudes about this alternative approach. Collectively, these findings indicate that variable ER may offer an efficacious strategy for improving weight loss and weight loss maintenance. As such, we propose to conduct a lifestyle intervention weight loss trial to compare the short- and long-term effects of two ER prescriptions: 1) a conventional, fixed
energy reduction (FER) that includes a 750 kcal/d deficit, and 2) a variable energy reduction (VER) that includes alternating at 2-week intervals between 500 and 1,000 kcal/d deficits. This 18-month trial will include 218 obese adults completing an intensive lifestyle intervention consisting of an initial 6 months of weekly treatment contacts, 6 months of bi-weekly contacts, and 6 months of observational follow-up. The primary outcome will be changes in body weight at month 18. Secondary outcomes will include changes in energy expenditure, body composition, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure, and weight-regulating hormones. Dietary adherence, hunger/satiety, and treatment satisfaction will also be assessed. This is a novel investigation, as no previous trial has rigorously examined VER as an alternative to a conventional FER. If VER produces superior outcomes, it would have significant clinical implications for the delivery of obesity treatment and dietary recommendations provided to participants. By examining a variety of behavioral, psychological, and biological variables, this study may provide additional information about potential mechanism by which different ER prescriptions promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a significant public health concern, and innovative strategies are needed to more effectively treat this condition. This project will compare the effects of two weight loss treatments that include either a conventional, constant level of caloric
reduction or one that alternates between different levels of caloric intake over time. This will hep us understand if this alternative approach of periodically changing caloric intake levels during treatment improves weight loss and weight loss maintenance.",2019,426730,292813,133917,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention,Gareth R Dutton
1R01MH118884-01A1,Epitranscriptomic Mapping of Novel N6-Adenosine-based RNA Methylation in MDD Brain,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) currently remains one of the leading causes of global disability. Despite the
rise in treatment options, remission rates in MDD patients are very low. Thus, there is critical need to identify the
biological substrates that precipitate in MDD in order to develop effective therapy. It is widely known that MDD
involves short- and long-term maladaptive processes to external stimuli, impairing the ability of individuals to
appropriately interact with the environment. So far, there is no coherent hypothesis that can fully explain this
phenomenon. Increasing evidence suggests that fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation by gene-environment
interaction is central to the etiology of MDD. In this regard, a paradigm shifting phenomenon has recently been
introduced with the unique concept of post-transcriptional gene regulation through epitranscriptomic mechanism
(most prominently being N6-methyladenosine [m6A]) which is not only involved in the regulation of transcript
abundance but has the profound ability to impact maturity, stability, localization, and most importantly, availability
of â€œselectâ€ gene transcripts to protein translation despite varying transcription rates in a highly â€œdynamicâ€ and
â€œreversibleâ€ fashion. This mechanism facilitates quick response to external stimuli, fine-tunes protein
accessibility, and executes localized control, which is critical to stimulus-adaptive gene expression. Their roles
have recently been shown in synaptic plasticity as well as in the stress coping behavior of mice. Our own
preliminary data demonstrate that not only is m6A mRNA methylation machinery differentially expressed in
various brain areas, but their expression and functions in manipulating m6A methylation and subsequent
expression of specific transcripts are aberrant in the MDD brain. This has led us to propose an overarching
hypothesis that m6A methylation-based epitranscriptomic modification of mRNAs may act as a dynamic regulator
of a subset of genes in a brain region specific manner, which, by affecting specific molecular pathways in a
coordinated fashion, will participate in MDD pathogenesis. To test this, in dlPFC and hippocampus from healthy
controls and well-matched MDD subjects, we propose the following aims: 1) Examine whether MDD is associated
with differential regulation of m6A methylation machinery and distinctive m6A methylation profile at the
epitranscriptomic level in brain region specific manner; 2) Define MDD associated role of YTH family of reader
proteins in epitranscriptomic turnover of protein coding genes; 3) Examine the impact of m6A mRNA methylation
on dendritic availability of local epitranscriptomic pool and their contribution to MDD pathogenesis. By using
highly innovative molecular approaches, by precisely identifying the fate of the transcripts in translatable and
non-translatable pools mediated through specific m6A reader proteins, by examining the role of m6A methylation
at the synapse, and by analyzing data using novel bioinformatics tools, our study is highly innovative; it has the
potential to discover unique epitranscriptome-based gene regulation as a mechanism in MDD etiopathogenesis
and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","NARRATIVE
Major depression is a debilitating disorder affecting millions of people worldwide with limited success in
treatment or remission. Despite a wealth of neurobiological studies over the last few decades, our

research to examine unique epitranscriptomic regulation of genes, representing dynamic and reversible RNA

5R01MH100616-05,MicroRNA Mapping in Major Depression,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MDD is one of the most severe and debilitating illnesses that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Despite considerable advances over the past decades, a clear understanding of the etiology of MDD is still lacking. Accumulating evidence suggests that MDD may arise from impairments in cellular cascades, which lead to aberrant information processing in the circuits that regulate mood, cognition, and neurovegetative functions. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of small non-coding RNAs that by binding to 3' UTR of mRNAs, suppress the translation and/or stability of specific mRNA targets. Since miRNAs show a highly regulated expression, they contribute in the development and maintenance of a specific transcriptome and thus have the unique ability to influence physiological and disease phenotypes. Our recent studies show that the expression of a group of miRNAs is altered in PFC of MDD subjects and that they are involved in coping response to stress. In addition, accumulative evidence points to the involvement of miRNAs in neural plasticity. These studies suggest a strong possibility that miRNAs may contribute significantly to the etiopathogenesis of MDD. We hypothesize that subsets of miRNAs and their variants, regulated in a coordinated fashion, will show differential co-expression in MDD brain, which by affecting specific neural/synaptic mRNA targets and cellular pathways, will participate in MDD pathogenesis. In well characterized postmortem brain samples obtained from MDD and control subjects, we propose to: 1) profile miRNA expression by small RNA sequencing, identify novel miRNAs, and analyze differentially expressed miRNAs; 2) profile mRNA expression by RNA sequencing and identify regulatory relationships between mRNA and miRNA by mapping co-expression network modules; 3) analyze miRNA-mRNA pairs, validate altered miRNAs and specific target genes experimentally, and localize these changes at the cellular level; 4) analyze pathway associated with differentially co-expressed modules in MDD; 5) examine miRNA biogenesis by determining pri-/pre-miRNAs, RISC complexes, and components of biogenesis machinery; and 6) examine the role of synaptic miRNAs in MDD pathogenesis by determining miRNA enrichment via small RNA sequencing in synaptosomes, analyzing target genes and co-expression modules of miRNA-mRNA specifically altered in the synaptic fraction, and examining pri-/pre-miRNAs and components of miRNA biogenesis machinery at synaptic level. By using a combination of the state-of-the-art high throughput small RNA and RNA sequencing, analyzing data by novel bioinformatics tools and validation, identifying changes in miRNAs and their targets in specific cell type(s), and examining the role of miRNAs at the synaptic level in brain regions implicated in mood and cognition, our proposed study is uniquely positioned to advance the field of MDD research at the molecular level. These investigations will provide novel avenues for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tools'' with the potential to generate new molecular-based therapies to treat this devastating disorder.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: microRNAs are the best-known and best-understood class of small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as major regulators of gene expression. In recent studies, we have found that microRNAs are altered in the brain of depressed subjects and are involved in coping response to stress. These studies, along with studies showing that microRNAs are involved in biological functions including synaptic plasticity, suggest that microRNAs may play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of major depression. Our proposed study is aimed at delineating how microRNA can contribute to the pathogenesis of major depression. Since microRNAs are ideally positioned to play a central role in regulating complex gene network, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on modulation of microRNA activity hold great promise.

5R01MH107183-05,Plasma Exosomal MicroRNAs as Promising Novel Biomarkers for Suicidality and Treatment Outcome,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US ages between 15-34 years and about one million people commit suicide every year world-wide. Thus, there is a desperate need for identifying risk factors and for non- invasive, reliable biomarkers that can be used for early detection of suicidality and treatment response. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of small non-coding RNAs that bind to 3' UTR of mRNAs and suppress the translation and/or stability of specific target genes. Since miRNAs show a highly regulated expression, they contribute in the development and maintenance of a specific transcriptome and thus have the unique ability to influence physiological and disease phenotypes. Our recent studies show that the expression of a group of miRNAs is altered in brain of depressed subjects and that they are involved in coping response to stress. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that a subset of miRNAs is specifically altered in brain of suicide subjects regardless of psychopathology, suggesting that miRNAs can distinguish suicidality. Recently, circulating miRNAs are under intense investigation and have been extremely useful in detecting and following the course of various diseases. Neural miRNAs are responsive to environmental, synaptic, and pathological changes and can be actively secreted by cells such as exosomes from brain into blood. These exosomes bear cell-type specific surface markers. Using a neural specific surface marker, we successfully isolated neural-derived exosomes and found that these exosomes are enriched with miRNAs/mRNAs that are expressed in brain. Using this novel approach we aim to examine whether neural- derived exosomal miRNAs are differentially expressed that are specific to suicidal ideation or behavior, and which by affecting specific mRNA targets and pathways, are associated with suicidal behavior and response to ketamine. We will examine the following groups of subjects: 1) major depressive disorder (MDD) with a recent suicide attempt (in past 2 weeks), 2) MDD with serious ideation without recent suicide attempt (in the past 6 months), 3) MDD without clinically significant suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in the past 6 months, and 4) healthy controls. Both suicidal and non-suicidal MDD will be given ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, IV) and blood drawn at 30 and 180 min post-infusion to measure changes in miRNAs. We also propose a parallel human postmortem brain study to examine whether changes in miRNAs in suicidality correspond to miRNA changes in brain by comparing dlPFC and hippocampus from MDD suicide, MDD non-suicide, and control subjects. With this we attempt to achieve: 1) whether suicidal ideation or behavior is associated with differences in the expression of specific miRNAs, 2) whether anti-suicidal/antidepressant effects of ketamine is associated with miRNAs changes, and 3) whether miRNA/mRNA-regulatory pathways contribute to suicide pathogenesis and treatment response. Our study will provide a novel avenue for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tool'' to identify suicidality and treatment response and in generating target based
therapies to treat this devastating disorder.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed study will provide novel avenues for the development of miRNAs as ''molecular tools'' to diagnose suicidal behavior and therapeutic response of anti-suicidal agents with the potential to generate new molecular-based therapies to treat this devastating disorder.,2019,698326,477108,221218,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Depression; Genetics; Major Depressive Disorder; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Precision Medicine; Serious Mental Illness; Suicide,Yogesh  Dwivedi; Richard Charles Shelton
5R01DK093810-07,Mouse-on-a-chip systems to evaluate pancreas-adipose tissue dynamics in vitro,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rather than a mere storage site for triglycerides, it is now understood that adipose tissue (fat) is a complex, multicellular endocrine organ that has profound systemic effects, altering the function of nearly all other organ systems. Despite its importance, however, there is a lack of information on the dynamic nature of adipokine secretion and nutrient uptake in adipose tissue, highlighting several unmet needs in methodology. Few techniques exist to interrogate small amounts of adipose tissue, and there is a shortage of methods to explore dynamic function of the organ. Specifically, we have a limited view of the dynamic relationship between glucose, insulin, and adipose function, highlighting an immediate need for better in vitro techniques to study pancreas-adipose tissue crosstalk. As demonstrated in our previous funding period, we propose that our microfluidic systems are ideal to meet these ongoing needs. Our research team developed microfluidic approaches for culture of endocrine tissue, namely pancreatic islets and adipose tissue from C57BL/6J mice, as well as for sampling of hormone secretion. These systems permit dynamic interrogation of the tissues in ways not possible with standard techniques. The long-term goal of this research is to develop in vitro models of the endocrine system for applications in nutrition, metabolism, and drug discovery. In the short term, our objective is to develop a mouse-on-a-chip microfluidic system that permits dynamic and quantitative measurements of both hormone secretion and nutrient uptake from primary tissue. Microfluidic devices will be developed concurrently with small-volume methodology to assay secretion or nutrient uptake from pancreatic islets and adipose tissue, and 3D printing will be used to improve our novel device interfacing and tissue culture methods. Aim 1 of the proposal seeks to develop an automated microfluidic input/output multiplexer (ÂµMUX) for generalizable dynamic control over hormones and nutrients to/from endocrine tissue. Aim 2 will result in targeted small-volume compatible assays for hormones and free fatty acid uptake in adipose tissue. Aims 3 and 4 are biological in nature, using the ÂµMUX system to determine the dynamics of hormone secretion, fatty acid uptake, and lipolysis in endocrine tissues with varied glycemic dynamics (Aim 3), and determining the role of dynamic feedback between the tissues using a co-culture ÂµMUX system (Aim 4). The rationale for this research to provide a flexibly programmable, in vitro micro-model of pancreas-adipose dynamics to test several important biological hypotheses related to gut-pancreas signaling dynamics, insulin/lipolysis/fatty acid uptake dynamics, and regulation of lipolysis at low insulin and glucos (fasting or ketogenic metabolism). The proposed work is significant as a first-of-its-kind in vitro
mimic of pancreas-adipose physiology, which we expect will lead to better information on human dietary interventions. The proposal is thus innovative in its technological and its biological approaches. Preliminary evidence strongly supports the feasibility of these proposals, and the research team has a proven track-record of success.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than two-thirds of the US population is considered overweight or obese, and with diabetes incidence continuing to rise, studies have begun to reevaluate our standard dietary recommendations. Emerging evidence from diets low in carbohydrates has implicated a key role for insulin signaling, yet our view of the timing of insuli secretion and fat uptake into adipose tissue is limited.

2R01HD046795-11A1,Predicting Young Adult Health: Family Aggression and Bioregulatory Pathways,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hostile marital conflict and harsh parenting (family aggression) are highly prevalent. Chronic
exposure to family aggression elevates individualsâ€™ risk for antisocial and risky behavior,
depressed mood, and cognitive decrements. Significant gaps in this research include scarce
investigations of long-term developmental trajectories of adaptation and maladaptation
associated with exposure to family aggression. Furthermore, explaining variability in trajectories
of health in the context of family aggressionâ€”why some individuals exhibit resilience and others
deteriorateâ€”is a critical need for science and practice. The proposed study addresses these
open questions and will illuminate autonomic nervous system activity and sleep regulation
parameters (bioregulatory processes), as well as social context variables (socioeconomic
status), which may mediate the risk of family aggression or operate to exacerbate or protect
against its effects on emotional and behavioral maladjustment from childhood through early
adulthood. The design builds on a well-characterized 6-wave study and involves 2 additional
waves. The sample consists of youth between 8 and 18 years across the six study waves who
will be ~22-23 years at the seventh wave. Strengths of the design include the large and diverse

elucidate bioregulatory processes that transmit risk or function as vulnerability or protective
factors in the context of family aggression; and document young adult outcomes of family
aggression in domains of public health priority, such as substance use and mental health

5R01HL136752-03,Child Sleep as a Mechanism and Moderator in the Development of Health Disparities,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep deprivation in American youth is a major public health problem. Many youth experience
insufficient and poor quality sleep, which can impair mental and physical health and cognitive-
academic achievement. Significant gaps in this research include scarce investigations of long-
term developmental trajectories of adaptation and maladaptation associated with objectively
assessed sleep disturbances in youth. Furthermore, understanding the socioeconomic context
of childrenâ€™s sleep remains a critical gap in the field. Indeed, understanding mechanisms that
explain health disparities as well as factors that prevent or protect against health disparities are
high scientific priorities (Healthy People 2020). The proposed study addresses these gaps and
advances parent grant discoveries. The design builds on a well-characterized 3-wave study and
involves 3 additional waves. The sample consists of 355 youth (15-16 years at the fourth study
wave) from semi-rural Alabama, with a high representation of African Americans and economic
adversity. Strengths of the design include the large and diverse sample, breadth of
measurement across important outcome domains, and 6 study waves, permitting analyses of
long-term trajectories of mental health, physical health, autonomic nervous system activity, and
cognitive-academic functioning in the context of health disparities. Constructs are assessed with
multiple measures and informants. Sleep is examined objectively, via actigraphy, and
subjectively. Autonomic nervous system activity is measured with well-established indices and
procedures. The study will advance understanding of sleep in youth, by examining sleep
variables that explain, exacerbate, or attenuate the negative effects of socioeconomic and racial
health disparities (PA-13-292, Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and
Reducing Health Disparities; PA-14-033, Reducing Health Disparities among Minority and

5R01NR017181-02,"A Community-Developed, Culturally-Based PC Tele-Consult Program for African American and White Rural Southern Elders with a Life-limiting Illness","Rural patients with life-limiting illness are at very high risk of not receiving appropriate care due to a lack of
health professionals, long distances to treatment centers, and limited palliative care (PC) clinical expertise.
Although culture strongly influences people's response to diagnosis, illness and treatment preferences,
culturally-based care models are not currently available for most seriously-ill rural patients and their family
caregivers. Public health consequences of these problems are: 1) Access-Rural patients have sub-optimal or
no access to PC and 2) Acceptability-Even when palliative and hospice services are available, African
Americans (AA), compared to Whites (W) are more likely to receive poor quality care due to a culturally-
insensitive health care system and mistrust of health care providers. As a result, rural patients, especially from
minority groups, experience significant suffering from uncontrolled symptoms that PC expertise could alleviate.
 Our R21 Tele-consult pilot studyand our other telehealth RCTs have systematically incorporated diverse
community stakeholder input on how to best design and deliver culturally-based palliative care for rural communities. Our
Tele-consult Intervention was developed by and for rural, Deep South AA and W patients and providers, and uses state-of-
the-art telehealth methods, to provide PC consultation to hospitalized seriously-ill patients and family. Using National
Consensus Project guidelines that have been adapted through a culturally-based, community-developed CBPR process,
we developed a PC Tele-consult intervention whereby a remote PC expert conducts a comprehensive PC patient
assessment, in collaboration with local providers, and following interdisciplinary PC team review, makes recommendations.
Two additional structured follow up contacts of PC expert with patient and local provider ensure care coordination and
smooth transitions, allowing patients to receive guideline-concurrent PC care in their communities.
 We propose a three-site, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a community-developed, culturally-based
PC Tele-consult program for 352 hospitalized AA and W older adults with life-limiting illnesses. We have partnered with 3
rural, Deep South community hospitals, located in South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi that lack PC resources and
recognize the potential benefits that PC expertise via Tele-consult can provide. Prior to study launch, we will assemble a
local Community Advisory Group at each site to provide further input and assist in communicating study goals to patients.
 Study aims are to compare a robust, culturally-based PC Tele-consult program to usual hospital care to determine
whether a culturally-based PC Tele-consult program leads to: 1. Lower symptom burden in hospitalized AA and W older
adults with a life-limiting illness (primary aim) and 2. Higher patient and caregiver quality of life, care satisfaction, and lower
caregiver burden at Day 7 post-consultation, and lower resource use 30-days post-discharge (secondary aim.)
 Impact: Ours is one of the first culturally-based palliative care Tele-consult programs developed by and for the rural
southern AA and W populations it serves. This study will move the field forward by testing a promising culturally-based
Tele-consult intervention that is scalable, and serves as a model for future culturally-based PC programs.","Despite the significant growth of palliative care programs nationwide, access to and dissemination of
palliative care to the nearly 60 million US citizens who live in rural or non-metropolitan areas is grossly
inadequate. Although culture fundamentally shapes how individuals make meaning out of illness, suffering,
and dying, and strongly influences people's response to diagnosis and illness and their treatment
preferences, culturally- appropriate models of care for seriously-ill rural patients and their family caregivers
are not currently available in the US. We are studying whether, compared with usual care, a culturally-
based, telehealth palliative care consultation and follow up lowers symptom burden and improves patient and
caregiver quality of life, care satisfaction, and lowers caregiver burden and resource use in hospitalized African

3P01CA210946-03S1,RXR Rexinoids for Cancer Chemoprevention,"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), (squamous cell carcinoma [SCC] and basal cell
carcinoma [BCC]), are major sources of morbidity in long term survivors of renal transplantation.
Due to medications these patients must take to prevent transplant rejection, NMSCs occur more
frequently (65-250x the general population for SCC; 10x for BCC), behave more aggressively,
and are more likely to metastasize than in the general population. Oral retinoids effectively protect
against NMSCs in these patients, but at dosages with unacceptable toxicity. Our team has
designed rexinoids with high specificity for the retinoid X receptor (RXR) without signaling through
RXR:LXR (liver X receptor) in the liver (or other RXR heterodimers). This eliminates the marked
hypertriglyceridemia that is the rate limiting toxicity of bexarotene, the only FDA approved RXR
binding rexinoid. Our lead compound, UAB30, prevents UV-induced NMSCs in animal models.
UAB30 has entered clinical trials in normal individuals and has shown no significant toxicity. We
hypothesize that UAB30 and other rexinoids that are based on UAB30's structure can be used as
highly effective, low toxicity chemopreventive agents limiting NMSCs in renal transplant
recipients. This Program brings together 7 researchers to carefully investigate mechanisms of
rexinoid chemoprevention of NMSCs, and to develop a systemic approach to translating the

5P01CA210946-03,Project 1: Evaluation of UAB30 on skin cancer biomarkers in human renal transplant recipients,"Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) i.e. cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are the most common malignancies in organ transplant
recipients (OTRs). OTRs have a 65-250x greater risk of cutaneous SCCs and a 10x increased
risk of BCCs than the general population, and when they do occur, NMSCs behave more
aggressively. For example, the rate of SCC metastases in OTRs is 7%, which is much higher than
the general population. Current methods for prevention of NMSCs consist primarily of sun and
tanning bed avoidance and the regular use of sunscreens. These measures have proven to be
inadequate. Oral retinoids are effective chemopreventive agents in OTRs, but at the doses
required, are poorly tolerated. UAB30 is a novel RXR selective retinoid (i.e. rexinoid), which is a
potent chemopreventive agent for SCCs and other epithelial tumors in animal models, and has
been shown to be well-tolerated in phase I human clinical trials in normal individuals. We plan to
conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled biomarker study of oral UAB30 in OTRs
with actinic damage and a history of BCC and/or SCC. The purpose of this short-term clinical trial
is to determine whether UAB30 has a protective effect on molecules associated with the
development of NMSC in OTRs. We plan to determine whether a greater percentage of OTRs
randomized to receive oral UAB30 will have >30% reduction in skin biomarkers associated with
development of NMSC. Cyclin D1, a marker of cell proliferation, will be the primary endpoint.
Other biomarkers to be evaluated include additional molecules associated with proliferation and
apoptosis, off target molecules in the DNA damage repair and Src pathways, all-trans-retinoic
acid genes, and parameters associated with the host anti-tumor immune response. We also plan
to investigate whether premalignant actinic keratoses will undergo regression and if the onset of
new actinic keratoses will be inhibited in OTR and non-OTR participants randomized to UAB30.
Finally, we will evaluate the safety of oral UAB30 in OTRs. This is a rational first step to determine
the feasibility of testing UAB30 as a chemopreventive agent for NMSC in OTRs prior to a larger,
long-term, and more costly clinical trial. It may also identify procedures for screening future
rexinoids for their chemopreventive actions in vivo in humans.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

ABSTRACT
The UAB Cancer Center Chemoprevention Program was established to identify novel chemopreventive agents
capable of preventing cancer, to determine the ability of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals to prevent
or delay carcinogenesis, to determine their mechanisms of action and identify biomarkers, and to perform early
phase chemoprevention trials evaluating novel chemopreventive agents. The focus of the Program is directed
toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of
the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program.
Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co-
directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB
Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of
the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and
5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI.
In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the
capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs
Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other
institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human
chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has
produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and
34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with
lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators.
Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including
rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.",,2019,118946,82123,36823,Research Centers,P30,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition; Prevention,Craig A Elmets

Due to medications these patients must take to prevent transplant rejection, NMSCs occur more
frequently (65-250x the general population for SCC; 10x for BCC), behave more aggressively,
and are more likely to metastasize than in the general population. Oral retinoids effectively protect
against NMSCs in these patients, but at dosages with unacceptable toxicity. Our team has
designed rexinoids with high specificity for the retinoid X receptor (RXR) without signaling through
RXR:LXR (liver X receptor) in the liver (or other RXR heterodimers). This eliminates the marked
hypertriglyceridemia that is the rate limiting toxicity of bexarotene, the only FDA approved RXR
binding rexinoid. Our lead compound, UAB30, prevents UV-induced NMSCs in animal models.
UAB30 has entered clinical trials in normal individuals and has shown no significant toxicity. We
hypothesize that UAB30 and other rexinoids that are based on UAB30's structure can be used as
highly effective, low toxicity chemopreventive agents limiting NMSCs in renal transplant
recipients. This Program brings together 7 researchers to carefully investigate mechanisms of

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
   
Melanomas are responsible for more deaths than any other cutaneous malignancy. They are a particular problem for Veterans who have extensive exposure to its two most common etiologic factors - ultraviolet radiation and carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and who have been shown to be at increased risk for this type of malignancy. There has been substantial progress in the treatment of advanced and metastatic melanomas. Many melanomas begin as premalignant dysplastic nevi, which after months to years, progress to become progress to become invasive neoplasms. Despite the fact that there is a long lag period before premalignant dysplastic nevi become invasive melanomas, there has been little headway in the development of methods for their prevention. This is due at least in part to the fact that there are few animal
models that can evaluate preventive strategies. We have created a murine model of melanoma development in which pigmented lesions begin as preneoplastic dysplastic nevi and then evolve into invasive melanomas that metastasize to lymph nodes. RAS mutations and deletions in p16, both of which are common in human melanomas are present in the pigmented lesions. This contrasts with other murine models of melanoma, in which melanomas rapidly develop without the prior existence of dysplastic nevi. In addition, it is difficult to study host immune responsesin these other models, because mutant genes are present in all tissue specific cells as defined by the transgene promoter. We have observed that the cytokine IL-23 prevents the development of melanoma in this model. We have also found that immunization of mice against the mutant RAS protein will prevent non-melanoma skin cancers that express the mutation from developing. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the cytokine IL-23 protects against melanomas and their metastases. We will first evaluate whether molecular alterations that participate in the pathogenesis of melanoma occur more frequently in IL-23KO mice and whether administration of IL-23 can be used as an immunopreventive agent. We will then characterize the role of IL-17 in the genesis of melanocytic tumors. Last, we will determine whether the immunization procedure we have successfully employed for prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers can be used to prevent tumor growth and the metastatic potential of melanomas. The findings of this application may form the foundation for new immunopreventive strategies for this malignancy that is occurring with increasing frequency in Veterans.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs; cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas) are the most common malignancies in humans in the United States. They are the source of considerable morbidity and are a tremendous cost to the health care system. Current methods for their prevention have consisted primarily of sun and tanning bed avoidance and the regular use of sunscreens. Unfortunately, these measures have proven inadequate, and in contrast to most other malignancies, the incidence of NMSCs continues to increase. Two agents that show promise for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), which inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. In other organ systems, these agents have synergistic cancer chemopreventive activities. Because the skin is readily accessible, it may be possible to apply topical formulations of these agents for the chemoprevention of skin cancers without encountering the potential for systemic toxicity. We hypothesize that topical application of the COX inhibitor diclofenac and/or topical DFMO for 9 months is a safe and effective method of reversing biomarkers associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancers in subjects at risk for their development and will prevent the onset of new actinic keratoses. To test
our hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 subjects with a history of basal cell and/or squamous cell skin cancer and at least 8 actinic keratoses. Patients will be randomized to receive: topical DFMO + placebo; placebo + topical diclofenac; topical DFMO + topical diclofenac; placebo + placebo. We will assess whether topical DFMO + topical diclofenac alters skin biomarkers focusing on prostaglandin E2, polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase, proliferation and apoptosis markers (Ki67, PCNA, cyclin D1, caspase 3, tunel assay, Bcl-2, Bax), and molecules in the Akt/ERK1/2 axis. Studies are planned to determine if treatment with topical DFMO and/or topical diclofenac is well-tolerated without signs of significant toxicity. We will also assess whether subjects randomized to topical diclofenac and/or topical DFMO develop over a 9 month period of time fewer new actinic keratoses than those who are placed on placebo. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to determine whether topical diclofenac and/or DFMO should be evaluated in a clinical trial for the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

5K23MH112417-03,"Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South","PROJECT SUMMARY:
The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Latesha Elopre, MD, MSPH the essential mentorship and
career development necessary to become an independent investigator whose research will contribute to
decreasing health inequity among underserved and disproportionately impacted populations regarding HIV
infection rates. The initial focus of her work will be in developing a behavioral intervention to increase uptake of
HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Deep
South. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 50% of black MSM will become
infected with HIV in their lifetime. Furthermore, the Southern United States is seeing the highest rates of new
HIV infections in this population, with rates rapidly increasing for young, black MSM. Through consistent use of
PrEP, a biomedical prevention tool, decreased HIV infection rates can be seen among young, Black MSM.
Research focusing on increasing HIV prevention services and decreasing health disparities in HIV incidence
have been high priority for the NIH. However, there have been few studies evaluating PrEP uptake among
young, Black MSM in the Deep South. In concordance with prior research that has shown individual and
structural factors leading to increased stigma and marginalization for black MSM, this study will be grounded in
the Andersen Behavioral Model for Healthcare Utilization with subsequent individual level intervention driven
by the situated Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills theoretical framework. This conceptual model will
allow for investigation of core determinants of health behavior in the context of individual and societal barriers
influencing health service utilization. A mixed-methods research design will aid in targeted intervention
development with a more granular understanding of potential barriers for PrEP uptake.
Hypothesis: Characteristics that pertain to stigma related to PrEP, HIV, race, religion and poverty as well as
healthcare access will be major barriers to awareness and uptake of PrEP for young, Black MSM in the South.
The specific aims for this research proposal are as follows:
Aim 1: Determine critical beliefs and attitudes regarding PrEP awareness and uptake among young, Black
MSM in the South.
Aim 2: Determine environmental barriers for delivery of PrEP to young, black MSM in the South.
Aim 3: Develop a targeted intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the South.
With guidance from my mentorship team, a career development plan has been created to gain training in
behavioral theory, intervention development and mixed-methods research design enabled by additional
coursework, hands on training, seminars and national workshops. Upon completion of the proposed scientific
aims, I will be poised to pilot a theory-guided behavioral intervention to enhance PrEP uptake among young
black MSM in the U.S. Deep South supported by an R-series grant.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Disproportionately high numbers of HIV infection are seen among young, Black men who have sex with men
(MSM) who live in the Southern United States. New estimates from the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention predict 1 in 2 Black MSM will be infected with HIV in their lifetime. Biomedical HIV prevention
strategies, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have been shown to effectively decrease rates of
HIV infection by up to 92% with consistent use. The project described in this application will develop a theory-
driven behavioral intervention, utilizing a mixed-methods research design, to increase uptake of PrEP among
young, Black MSM in the South.",2019,190122,176076,14046,Other Research-Related,K23,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Pediatric; Pediatric AIDS; Prevention,Latesha Ellen Elopre

ABSTRACT
The objective of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the UAB CCC is to assure that the
interventional (therapeutic and non-therapeutic) protocols for cancer have scientific merit, that they meet the
priorities of the UAB CCC, and that they progress to scientifically meaningful results. The PRMS is made up of
the Disease Working Groups (DWG), the Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and the Clinical Trial Operations
Committee (CTOC). The PRMS's responsibilities include the scientific review and prioritization of all
interventional protocols (clinical trials). The PRMS utilizes a three-tier review process whereby all interventional
protocols are assessed by the appropriate DWG for merit and prioritization and, upon approval, are submitted
to the CTOC. The CTOC reviews letters of intent for compliance with CCC priority guidelines, feasibility, and
infrastructure capacity. Upon CTOC approval protocols are submitted to the PRC. The PRC then undertakes
a detailed scientific review and makes final decisions for approval, approval with minor modifications, deferral
for major modifications, or disapproval. The PRC is composed of Cancer Center Associate Director for Clinical
Research and selected members representing expertise of the various oncology disciplines, laboratory
research, basic science, cancer control/prevention, radiology, biostatistics, and research nursing. Written
evaluation and recommendations of the committee accompany IRB applications on protocols approved by the
PRC. The CTOC also reviews all active protocols monthly in regard to patient accrual and progress and has
the authority to terminate any protocol that is not progressing.
During the current funding period, the PRMS has provided initial review and/or prioritization of 318 protocols
with 277 (87.1%) receiving approval (with or without minor revision) and 41 (12.9%) failing to receive approval
including 36 (11.3%) receiving deferral and 5 (1.6%) receiving disapproval. Of the 36 protocols receiving
deferral, 35 were granted approval on resubmission. The PRMS also provided administrative prioritization of
66 national cooperative group trials with Disease Working Group support and recommendations. Over the

5P30CA013148-47,Protocol Review and Monitoring System,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
ABSTRACT
The objective of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the UAB CCC is to assure that the
interventional (therapeutic and non-therapeutic) protocols for cancer have scientific merit, that they meet the
priorities of the UAB CCC, and that they progress to scientifically meaningful results. The PRMS is made up of
the Disease Working Groups (DWG), the Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and the Clinical Trial Operations
Committee (CTOC). The PRMS's responsibilities include the scientific review and prioritization of all
interventional protocols (clinical trials). The PRMS utilizes a three-tier review process whereby all interventional
protocols are assessed by the appropriate DWG for merit and prioritization and, upon approval, are submitted
to the CTOC. The CTOC reviews letters of intent for compliance with CCC priority guidelines, feasibility, and
infrastructure capacity. Upon CTOC approval protocols are submitted to the PRC. The PRC then undertakes
a detailed scientific review and makes final decisions for approval, approval with minor modifications, deferral
for major modifications, or disapproval. The PRC is composed of Cancer Center Associate Director for Clinical
Research and selected members representing expertise of the various oncology disciplines, laboratory
research, basic science, cancer control/prevention, radiology, biostatistics, and research nursing. Written
evaluation and recommendations of the committee accompany IRB applications on protocols approved by the
PRC. The CTOC also reviews all active protocols monthly in regard to patient accrual and progress and has
the authority to terminate any protocol that is not progressing.
During the current funding period, the PRMS has provided initial review and/or prioritization of 318 protocols
with 277 (87.1%) receiving approval (with or without minor revision) and 41 (12.9%) failing to receive approval
including 36 (11.3%) receiving deferral and 5 (1.6%) receiving disapproval. Of the 36 protocols receiving
deferral, 35 were granted approval on resubmission. The PRMS also provided administrative prioritization of
66 national cooperative group trials with Disease Working Group support and recommendations. Over the
past funding period, the PRMS provided annual review for accrual and progress of 208 active protocols. In the
2014 review for accrual and progress, the CTOC considered 108 protocols and identified 39 underperforming
trials. Of those, 27 received a 12-month approval for their action plans and 12 protocols were placed on
probation. Subsequently eight of those twelve were closed to accrual. The PRMS will continue rigorous review

5K08AI129705-03,Viral adaptation to CD4 T cell responses and the impact on HIV immunity,"ABSTRACT
Robust CD4 T cell responses are likely to be critical for any protective HIV vaccine through their multifaceted
support of immune effectors, but as the primary targets of HIV infection their contribution to host immunity has
been relatively understudied. We have recently demonstrated CD4 T cell immune responses are capable of
driving viral adaptation, but the mechanism of this activity and its relevance to overall disease pathogenesis is
unknown. A CD4 T cell subset, the T follicular helper cell (Tfh), has become a focus of investigation for
its role
in B cell differentiation and maturation as well as its facilitation of pathogen-specific high-affinity neutralizing
antibody responses.
 CD4 T cells also have cytotoxic potential, a phenotype we have shown is compromised by
single amino acid changes in viral epitopes suggesting a role in viral escape. We hypothesize viral
adaptation compromises the immunologic functions of CD4 T cells resulting in a survival benefit for
HIV and impacting the clinical course of disease. We will test this hypothesis in three separate aims:
Specific Aim 1: Through TCR sequencing, determine the effects of viral adaptation on CD4 T cells
ability to bind antigen and appropriately activate in response to stimulation.
Specific Aim 2: Define the impact of viral adaptation on CD4 T cell effector functions as expressed by
cytotoxic capacity and expansion of the Tfh phenotype.
Specific Aim 3: Determine whether persons infected with highly adapted virus have accelerated HIV-1
clinical disease progression.
The proposed aims will reveal the mechanism underlying viral adaptation to CD4 T cell immune pressure and
the impact on disease. To support these efforts, I have developed a collaborative program that will provide
access to primary tissues from deceased-donors, offering a unique opportunity to corroborate findings
observed in peripheral blood samples with those from tissue-derived lymphocytes. The mentorship team
combines a strong record of trainee development and expertise in the areas most relevant to the planned
experiments. I also present a curriculum designed to enhance my immunologic knowledge, technical
repertoire, statistical knowledge and professional development. The proposal will facilitate development of the
skills necessary to identify clinically relevant research questions and advance the understanding of immunity to
HIV and other chronic viral infections.","NARRATIVE
In this proposal, we lay out experiments to assess the effects of HIV adaptation to CD4 T cell responses and
the mechanisms underlying how adaptation influences immunogenicity and HIV disease progression. These
studies will lead to a greater understanding of HIV immunity with direct implications for rational vaccine design.

questions and advance the understanding of immunity to HIV and other chronic viral infections.",2019,195264,180800,14464,Other Research-Related,K08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Vaccine Related,Nathaniel Bernard Erdmann
5K01DK114332-03,GLYCOLATE METABOLISM AND KIDNEY OXALATE,"SUMMARY
 Kidney stones, of which the most common are calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, affect 7 to 12% of the
United States population and are responsible for 3% of all end-stage renal disease cases. Urine oxalate is
derived from approximately 50% dietary sources and 50% from endogenous synthesis through various
pathways. Though it is well established that approximately 80% of the endogenous oxalate is produced in
the liver, the pathways for oxalate production are not well characterized. Our hypothesis is that glycolate is
a major source of oxalate and that the renal reabsorption of glycolate leads to renal synthesis of oxalate.
Establishing the role of glycolate in renal and liver synthesis of oxalate has implications for patients with the
hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria (PH), in which excessive endogenous oxalate production leads to
severe recurrent CaOx kidney stones. Establishing these pathways could lead to new treatments to inhibit
glycolate oxidation, resulting in reduced oxalate production.
 This proposal will 1) test if the metabolism of glycolate contributes to endogenous oxalate synthesis by
performing primed, steady state, continuous intravenous infusions of the stable isotope of glycolate, carbon-
13 glycolate, in healthy volunteers. 2) test the hypothesis that glycolate is metabolized to oxalate in proximal
tubule cells using a human proximal tubule cell line and freshly isolated human proximal tubule fragments
and 3) determine renal reabsorption and metabolism of glycolate using isolated rat kidney perfusions. The
roles of the enzyme hydroxyacid oxidase 2 (HAO2) and glyoxylate reductase (GR) will be defined in the
context of this conversion.
 The mentoring team and training plan associated with this proposal will ensure that the candidate
reaches the level of expertise in analytical chemistry, metabolic research, and human and animal studies
that are necessary to meet her goals. The candidate's long-term objective is to lead a strong independent
research program in the field of oxalate metabolism and the clinical disorders associated with it, including
the primary hyperoxalurias.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of glycolate to endogenous oxalate synthesis and to
define the role of the kidney in metabolizing glycolate to oxalate. The knowledge gained on oxalate
metabolism has the potential to be applied to patients with the inherited disease primary hyperoxaluria and
and to patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone disease.",2019,152604,141300,11304,Other Research-Related,K01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Kidney Disease; Urologic Diseases,Sonia  Fargue
5R01HL128714-05,Activation of Cardiac FGFR4 Causes Left Ventricular Hypertrophy,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. By promoting heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy is an important pathology in CKD and affects up to 90% of patients by the time they reach dialysis. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-secreted hormone that regulates phosphate homeostasis. Serum FGF23 levels are constitutively elevated in CKD and continuously rise as patient's progress to renal failure. While this massive increase in FGF23 helps to maintain normal serum phosphate levels, prospective human studies demonstrated a dose-dependent association between higher FGF23 levels and greater risks of cardiovascular events and mortality. As a potential mechanism, we demonstrated that elevated FGF23 is strongly associated with cardiac hypertrophy in a large CKD cohort, and that FGF23 can induce hypertrophy in cultured cardiac myocytes and in a series of animal models with elevated serum FGF23. Our previous work suggests that FGF23 excess represents a novel, risk-multiplying mechanism of pathological cardiac hypertrophy in CKD. The purpose of this proposal is to identify the FGF23 receptor that is required for cardiac remodeling in CKD and the underlying signal mechanism in cardiac myocytes. Our preliminary data in heterologous cell cultures indicate that of the four FGF receptor isoforms (FGFR1-4), FGF23 can specifically activate FGFR4 which results in the activation of phospholipase Cï§ (PLCï§). Blockade of PLCï§, calcineurin or FGFR4 inhibits FGF23-induced hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes in vitro. Different from wild type mice, elevating FGF23 in global FGFR4 knock-out mice by high phosphate diet does not because cardiac hypertrophy, and isolated cardiac myocytes from these mice are protected from FGF23-mediated hypertrophy. In Aim 1 we will determine if FGFR4 activation is sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Our preliminary data indicate that an established knock-in mouse model with an FGFR4 gain-of- function mutation (FGFR4-G385R) has hypertrophy at 6-months of age, and we will analyze if these mice develop further cardiac injury including myocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis leading to heart failure. Furthermore, we will analyze if cardiac remodeling in FGFR4-G385R mice is exacerbated in response to pressure overload or neuroendocrine stimulation. In Aim 2 we want to study the mechanism of FGF23-FGFR4 mediated hypertrophy. We postulate that FGFR4 activation induces calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiac myocytes. In Aim 3 we will analyze if FGFR4 is required for pathological cardiac remodeling in animals with prolonged FGF23 elevations. In a proof-of-concept experiment we want to determine if a highly specific FGFR4 blocking antibody attenuates hypertrophy in a rodent model of CKD. FGFR4 blockade might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat heart failure in CKD, and potentially more generally in patients with other forms of cardiovascular disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiac hypertrophy is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading killer of the large number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are markedly elevated, which contributes mechanistically to cardiac hypertrophy. In this proposal, we will identify the cardiac FGF23 receptor (FGFR), and test the effects of a highly specific FGFR blocking antibody on the heart as a novel therapeutic approach. Our long-term goal is to translate this proof-of-concept approach into first-in-human trials in individuals with CKD.",2019,375133,265147,109986,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Kidney Disease,Christian  Faul
5R01EY026574-03,African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation (ADAGES) IV: Alterations of the lamina cribrosa in progression,"Project Abstract
Overall Objective: This proposal is focused on morphological changes in the lamina cribrosa with glaucoma
onset and progression, and how those changes impact visual function, with a focus on racial disparities. This
project leverages on the longitudinal monitoring of a subset of glaucoma patients in the existing ADAGES
cohort of which 3.7 years(average) of enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDIOCT) and
visual field standard perimetry (VF) is available. The overall objective of the ADAGES studies is to identify
what ocular, systemic and genetic factors account for the differences in the glaucoma prevalence, severity,
and rates of disease progression in individuals of African Descent (AD) compared to those of European
Descent (ED). The specific aims are: 1) To determine if the progressive changes in lamina cribrosa
observed longitudinally in glaucomatous ADAGES patients will be associated with greater VF progression in
a 8(at least) year of EDOCT and VF follow-up imaging, and if this association differs across race. 2) To
determine what baseline morphologic characteristics of the optic nerve head (ONH) are associated with
progression-dependent remodeling of the lamina cribrosa and ONH. 3) To determine if mechanical
compliance of the ONH as measured in-vivo and longitudinally is associated with remodeling of the lamina
cribrosa and progressive neural tissue (structure) and VF damage (function). Design: Participants are 148
AD and 144 ED individuals with glaucoma who have 3.7 years(average) of ONH EDIOCT imaging and VF
longitudinal data from the ADAGES cohort. Demographic variables, ophthalmological examination including
stereo-photographs, visual function with standard perimetry, intraocular and systemic pressures, and other
risk factors will be documented longitudinally. The morphology and compliance of the lamina cribrosa and
ONH will be quantified on 60 newly enrolled ED and 60 AD glaucoma patients by EDIOCT and VF imaging
over a follow-up of 5 or more years. Impact: Glaucoma is 4 to 5 times more likely to occur and progress to
severe visual impairment in persons of AD compared to persons of ED. Our group has identified several
racial differences in the morphology and mechanical behavior of the lamina cribrosa and peripapillary sclera
that suggest these differences will meaningfully impact or possibly be causative of the load bearing
connective tissue remodeling seen in both natural aging and in the onset and progression of glaucoma. The
race-specific and extensive longitudinal data of this study will provide a detailed insight of the
pathophysiologic relationship between remodeling of the ONH load bearing tissues with the rate of structural
damage of the retinal neural tissue and the resulting progressive visual impairment. This study, through the
inclusion of an innovative biomechanical compliance testing protocol, will inform the development of
mechanistically relevant biomarkers for glaucoma necessary for the development of non-IOP lowering
glaucoma therapies targeted at altering mechanical strain-driven pathophysiology of the ONH.!","Project Narrative
African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study IV: Remodeling of the Laminar Cribrosa in Glaucoma will
investigate the clinically observed optic nerve connective tissue remodeling caused by glaucoma in
European and African descent patients. These load-bearing tissues provide the mechanical support to the
retinal axons that convey visual information to the brain. The knowledge gained about this remodeling
process and its relationship to racial variation in optic nerve structure and disease progression will provide
clinicians critical tools to better manage patient care, and it will provide researchers important information
toward the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing the resiliency of the optic nerve
to the IOP-induced biomechanical stress.",2019,635960,566540,69420,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Massimo Antonio Fazio; CHRISTOPHER Anthony GIRKIN; LINDA M ZANGWILL
1R21AR074569-01,Development of Targeted Drugs for Osteoporosis,"Project Summary
Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of the
skeleton, resulting in bone fragility and increased risks for fractures. Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance
between bone resorption and bone formation in favor of bone resorption. Thus, effective inhibition of bone
resorption has long been recognized as an important therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis. Osteoclasts, the
bone resorbing cell, differentiate from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation by M-CSF
and RANKL. RANKL exerts these diverse functions by binding and activating its receptor RANK. Mice lacking
the gene for either RANKL or RANK develop osteopetrosis due to complete failure to form osteoclast,
indicating that the RANKL/RANK system is essential for osteoclast formation. Thus, RANKL was recognized as
an attractive antiresorptive drug target for osteoporosis shortly after its discovery and Amgen subsequently
developed a humanized anti-RANKL antibody (denosumab) for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.
However, denosumab causes several side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), increased risk of
serious infections and atypical femur fractures. In particular, ONJ and increased infection risks are likely due to
the suppressing effect of denosumab on the immune system since RANKL regulates immune cell
development, function and survival. Also, as a biological agent, the cost of denosumab is high and the method
of delivery (injection) is not ideal. Thus, a better targeting strategy would be to use small molecules to target
RANK signaling pathways that are involved in osteoclast formation but not in the immune system function. We
previously identified two motifs in the RANK cytoplasmic domain that regulate osteoclast formation in vitro. To
assess the role of the two RANK motifs in osteoclast formation in vivo, we have generated knockin (KI) mice
bearing inactivating mutations in the two RANK motifs. Osteoclast formation is dramatically reduced in the KI
mice, confirming the role of these two motifs in osteoclast formation in vivo. Importantly, inactivation of these
two motifs does not affect the ability of RANK to activate the signaling pathways (NF-ÎºB and MAPK) known to
mediate immune cell development and function. Hence, we hypothesize that specifically targeting these two
RANK motifs has the potential to serve as effective and selective therapeutic targets for osteoporosis. Our
ultimate goal is to develop efficacious and safe small molecule drugs targeting the two RANK motifs for
osteoporosis. To this end, we have developed cell-based assays for identifying compounds targeting the two
RANK motifs. High throughput screens of 200,000 compounds with the cell-based assay systems followed by
counter screen assays have identified several compounds that potently inhibited osteoclast formation without
affecting the activation of NF-ÎºB and MAPK pathways in vitro. This proposal seeks to carry out important proof-
of-concept studies to assess the conceptual and technical feasibility of this novel therapeutic targeting strategy.","Project Narrative

5R21CA222763-02,Discovery of Novel Drug Targets for Breast Cancer,"Project Summary
The receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) was initially identified as an essential factor regulating
osteoclast formation and function. RANKL exerts its function by activating its cognate receptor RANK (the
receptor activator of NF-ÎºB). Given the crucial role of RANKL in osteoclast biology, Amgen has successfully
developed a humanized anti-RANKL antibody (denosumab) as a new drug for osteoporosis. In addition,
subsequent studies demonstrated that RANKL also plays a role in mammary gland development. Importantly,
RANKL has been further shown to play a role in progesterone-induced and Brca1 mutation-driven breast
cancer development. These findings suggest that the blockade of the RANKL function may be a novel
therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating breast cancer development. However, denosumab causes
various side effects including osteonecrosis of jaw and increased risk for serious infections since RANKL
regulates a variety of other biological processes including the immune function. We previously identified three
functional TRAF (TNF receptor associated factor)-binding motifs in the RANK cytoplasmic domain (Motif 1:
PFQEP369-373; Motif 2: PVQEET559-564; Motif 3: PVQEQG604-609) that regulate osteoclast formation. Intriguingly,
Motif 1 activates all of the known RANK signaling pathways (NF-ÎºB, JNK, p38, ERK and Akt pathways) but it
exerts minimal effects on osteoclast formation. In contrast, while Motifs 2 and 3 activate only one or two of the
known RANK signaling pathways, they are very potent in promoting osteoclast formation. In particular, dual
mutation of Motifs 2 and 3 dramatically impairs RANK signaling in osteoclast formation in vitro. To assess the
role of Motifs 2 and 3 in osteoclast formation in vivo, we have successfully generated knockin mice (KI) bearing
inactivating mutations in RANK Motifs 2 and 3. Osteoclast formation is dramatically reduced in the KI mice,
confirming the role of these two RANK motifs in osteoclast formation in vivo. Interestingly, we have also found
that mammary gland development is impaired in the KI mice. This finding suggests that these two RANK motifs
primarily mediate the RANK's function in mammary gland development. More importantly, this finding has also
raised a possibility that these two RANK motifs may also be involved in progesterone-induced and Brca1
mutation-driven breast cancer development. Moreover, we found that the dual mutation of RANK Motifs 2 and
3 does not affect the capacity of RANK to activate NF-ÎºB, MAPK and Akt pathways, which regulate immune
cell development and function. Based on these data, we hypothesize that RANK Motifs 2 and 3 have the
potential to serve as effective and selective drug targets for preventing and treating breast cancer. The
objective of this R21 proposal is to carry out crucial in vitro and mouse model studies to address this
hypothesis. Significantly, validation of these two RANK motifs as effective and selective drug targets for breast
cancer will facilitate future development of efficacious and safe drugs for preventing and treating breast cancer.","Project Narrative

This renewal application for a highly successful interdisciplinary pre-doctoral training program offers coordinated mentorship, didactic training, career development activities, and supervised research experiences to prepare PhD students for careers as independent investigators. The established pre- doctoral program will build on the momentum of a highly successful first funding cycle and complements and interfaces with our existing NIH-funded T32 program for post-doctoral training in obesity research. Students entering their 2nd year of PhD training enroll
in a formal integrated program tailored to individual interests. Trainees participate in the investigative programs of UAB's NIH-funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center, one of only 12 such centers nation-wide. Each trainee has an individual mentoring team consisting of a primary mentor and two co-mentors with one mentor from each of three major disciplinary domains (Biomedical; Behavioral/Social; Quantitative/Physical). The faculty's disciplinary diversity (physicists, physicians, psychologists, statisticians, physiologists, geneticists, epidemiologists,
etc.) and strong collaborative ties facilitates multidisciplinary training. Students from any UAB department may apply, but must have a mentoring team from this T32 program's approved faculty. All students, regardless of their departmental affiliation, participate in all activities nd coursework for this T32 program. Individuals are recruited from the large pool of eligible 1st year
PhD students on campus and selected via formal application and committee review, based on graduate school performance, faculty recommendations, and consideration of the degree to which their interests fit with those of the faculty and ongoing research programs. All trainees must have as a future plan an investigative career in obesity-related research. The program promotes an approach to investigation that is scientifically and ethically rigorous. Regular reviews of individual trainees with the program directors ensure that adequate progress toward an independent research career is made. Given: (1) the highly successful first 4 years of our program; (2) that our pool of high-quality eligible applicants radically exceeds the slots availabl; and (3) that we have been successful in recruiting a proportion of students from underrepresented backgrounds that exceeds the national average by more than a factor of 3, we respectfully request renewal of this program with a progressive increase from the existing 8 to a total of 12 slots.","Obesity is a highly prevalent condition that exacts a high price in suffering for afflicted individuals and

1F99NS113424-01,Adaptive Neuroplasticity Following Central Visual Field Loss in Macular Degeneration,"ABSTRACT
Macular degeneration (MD) is retinal disease that causes severe visual impairment in nearly 7 million people in
the U.S. This disease causes the progressive deterioration of photoreceptors in the center of the retina, known
as the macula, and renders patients unable to see in the center of the visual field. As a consequence, patients
with MD must rely on peripheral vision, making even the simplest everyday tasks, such as reading or
recognizing faces, much more difficult. Reliance on peripheral vision is extremely problematic, as it possesses
substantially lower resolution compared to central vision. In fact, many patients never fully adapt to using
peripheral vision effectively. Interestingly, however, some patients become particularly skilled at using their
spared peripheral vision. Prior work suggests that this adaptation to using peripheral vision happens at a
processing stage beyond the retina, specifically in visual cortex. There is debate in the literature about
whether or not brain regions that formerly responded to central (lost) vision remap their function to respond to
peripheral (spared) vision. We address a different form of plasticity here: remodeling of the brain regions
which originally responded to peripheral (spared) vision so that they are more capable of taking on the
functions of central vision. Our hypothesis is that peripherally-representing visual cortex builds new
connections after experience, and this changes the structure and function of that region. Using neuroimaging
(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in human participants, we have generated preliminary evidence that suggests
that some of these changes may exist in the form of alterations to brain structure (neurite density and cortical
thickness) and brain function (functional connectivity). For example, we have observed that the parts of visual
cortex that respond to peripheral vision have greater cortical thickness in MD patients compared to healthy
controls, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism that may be associated with enhanced use of
peripheral vision. Additionally, we have observed that peripheral regions of early visual cortex in MD patients
are more strongly functionally connected to later visual areas that selectively respond to specific types of visual
stimuli, such as facial features and words/letters. We will test the hypothesis that better use of peripheral
vision in MD is associated with enhanced functional connectivity and enhanced structure (neurite
density and cortical thickness). More specifically, we predict that enhanced visual function in MD will be
related to stronger functional connectivity between peripheral areas of primary visual cortex and later visual
areas that respond preferentially to categories of stimuli (i.e.- faces, and words). Additionally, we predict that
greater neurite density and cortical thickness in primary visual cortex will be related to behavioral performance
on visual processing tasks. These findings will help provide insight towards improving therapeutic interventions
for MD, as well as uncover knowledge about the adult brainâ€™s potential for adaptation to changes in experience.","Project Narrative
Macular Degeneration is a disease that forces individuals to rely on the low resolution of peripheral vision to
perform everyday visual tasks. Understanding how the brainâ€™s visual system adapts to using peripheral vision
could potentially aid in the development of behavioral interventions for this debilitating form of visual
impairment. Using modern techniques in human neuroimaging, the proposed study will investigate how
changes in the structure (neurite density and cortical thickness) and function (functional connectivity) of visual
cortex enable adaptation to central vision loss.",2019,39016,39016,,Other Research-Related,F99,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Leland  Fleming

fostered through coursework, short courses, didactic opportunities and hands-on experiences, allowing Dr.
Davis-Fobian to ultimately become a nationally recognized obesity and type 2 diabetes prevention researcher.
 The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the effects of a sleep and media use intervention on body
composition and risk for type 2 diabetes in obese adolescents aged 15-17. This will be accomplished through 2
specific aims: 1) Conduct a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial of the relative effects of an
intervention for adolescent sleep duration and media use on sleep duration and quality, insulin sensitivity,
appetite-regulating hormones, and body composition; and 2) Evaluate whether the sleep intervention affects
adolescents' nighttime media use at both the end of the intervention and the 3-month follow-up.","Project Narrative
 Although the adolescent obesity rate and risk for type 2 diabetes is significant, current lifestyle
interventions for obesity focused on physical activity and food intake have not shown significant long-term
benefits, indicating the need for new approaches to the treatment of obesity. Although the relationship between
sleep and obesity has been repeatedly demonstrated, there have been no reports of the effects of successful
sleep interventions on adolescent obesity and risk for type 2 diabetes. Findings from this study will be useful in
determining the benefit of treating inadequate sleep duration and quality for adolescent obesity and diabetes
risk.",2019,154593,143142,11451,Other Research-Related,K23,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Childhood Obesity; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Prevention; Sleep Research,Aaron D Fobian

ABSTRACT
The Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Program is the major translational/clinical research engine of the UAB
CCC. The main objective of the ET Program is to develop novel therapeutic strategies that will provide cancer
patients with an enhanced opportunity for cure and, if not cured, with an improved survival time, increased
freedom from disease progression, and an improvement and relief of cancer-associated symptoms (improved
quality of life). The pursuit of this overall objective involves three scientific aims: (1) to promote and implement
translational clinical trials and preclinical research involving basic scientists and clinical faculty, (2) to promote
discovery and validation of biomarkers that can aid in cancer diagnosis/prognosis, prediction of therapeutic
response and selection of populations most likely to benefit from treatment modalities, and (3) to promote
development of novel imaging technology that can be integrated into pre-clinical and translational clinical
studies. These scientific goals have been enhanced by active SPORE funding (Brain, Breast, Pancreas, and
Cervical cancers) and The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Promise Grant. In addition, there has been a
significant expansion in scientific collaborations with Southern Research (SR) for drug discovery and
development and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology for high-throughput genetic sequencing. The drug
discovery efforts of the ET Program have been enhanced by the formalization of the Phase I Clinical trials
Program, and the implementation of the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance (ADDA). Strong collaborations with
other national research groups have been established including the Translational Breast Cancer Research
Consortium (TBCRC) and the National Cooperative Groups through the NCI U10-NCTC Lead Academic
Partnership Site grant. The acquisition and implementation of the cyclotron has added major pre-clinical and
clinical PET research capabilities to the program. Recent key recruitments have significantly enhanced clinical
trial implementation and accrual over the last two years. The ET program has continued to grow in
membership, research budget, and accrual to therapeutic trials. Primary faculty in the ET Program represent
13 departments, 4 schools, SR and HudsonAlpha, with total membership increasing from 62 faculty in 2011 to
69 in 2015. The overall research budget has increased from $10,994,390 annual direct costs in 2011 to
$11,222,026 annual direct costs in 2015 ($2,450,158 from the National Cancer Institute [NCI], $3,473,522 of
other peer-reviewed, and $4,588,101 million in Industry annual direct research support). Patient accrual to
therapeutic trials over the past four year funding period was 1,717 patients, including 32% accrual to
investigator-initiated trials, 28% to pilot/phase I studies, and 33% to phase II trials. The program had 426

3U54MD000502-17S1,Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC) Regional Expansion,"Project Summary/Abstract
With this supplement, the Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC) will focus on African
Americans living in rural and low-income inner-city communities in the Southeast to impact health disparities
associated with obesity and related chronic diseases. The targeted region was selected based on disease
burden and health needs, our ability to reach the population and availability of partners to facilitate the
implementation of academic research and community projects. Our academic partners include the Louisiana
State University (LSU), the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) and Jackson State University
(JSU); all are located in an area of highly visible need, within close proximity to large poor, underserved
minority populations. We benefit from longstanding relationships with these regional partners and from
established strong ties to community organizations in each state.
To impact the significant health disparities of our region, the OHDRC will accomplish the following aims. We
will expand the OHDRC Common Data Elements and Measurement Shared Resource to incorporate regional
social determinants of health (SDH) measures for use by investigators and by clinicians through their
incorporation into the electronic health records of patients in our three partnering states to develop risk
prediction tools for chronic disease incidence, progression, treatment and outcomes. We will also expand the
OHDRC career enhancement and mentored health disparities research training opportunities to investigators
at LSU, UMMC and JSU through innovative and complementary regional pilot awards and secondary cohort
data analysis opportunities to build regional research capacity in obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases
research. Finally, we will leverage existing relationships established through the previously funded NIMHD U54
Mid-South Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for Health Disparities Research (Mid-South TCC) to
strengthen engagement of partners and coalitions and to implement evidence-based interventions by
conducting a regional demonstration project to evaluate community-led implementation of an evidence-based
intervention â€“ Reach Up & Out: Toward a Healthier Lifestyle â€“ to impact healthy eating and physical activity in
African-American women in rural and urban Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.
This supplement has prompted our institution to take its strong history of multidisciplinary collaboration to a
new level, by collectively expanding the efforts of many centers to encompass the Southeast region. Our
proposed regional expansion will place the OHDRC in a unique position to build research capacity to address
chronic diseases, provide tools to improve health outcomes, and engage communities to conduct evidence-
based research in partnership with our underserved populations to exert a sustainable and measurable impact
on the significant obesity and related chronic disease health disparities in this region.","Project Narrative

between African Americans and Whites in Alabama, thereby reducing other related health disparities in chronic
diseases through transdisciplinary, multi-level, multi-domain research. While we recognize the value of our
efforts statewide, this supplement provides us the opportunity to expand both our research impact and our
geographic reach by partnering with institutions in Louisiana (Louisiana State University) and Mississippi (the
University of Mississippi Medical Center and Jackson State University). Our proposed regional expansion will

universities across the country, there continues to be a lack of diversity in most disciplines, including the
biomedical sciences. We will leverage our experience in training underrepresented minority students and our
expertise and connections related to NIDDK mission areas to ensure that we are inspiring and developing the
next generation of NIDDK researchers. The specific aims of UAB STEP-UP: Promoting Diversity through
Mentored Research Experiences (UAB STEP-UP) include: 1) training promising and diverse undergraduate
students from across the country by developing a career roadmap for each, to include hands-on mentored
research experiences and career development opportunities; 2) utilizing existing research networks to develop
a cadre of mentors invested in training undergraduate students to conduct research in the areas of diabetes
and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney,
urologic and hematologic diseases; 3) adapting successful on-site training programs into effective distance
learning activities targeting NIDDK content areas and preparation for graduate school and/or future careers in
research; 4) utilizing a combination of human interaction (i.e., Program Manager, Institutional Coordinators,
mentors and other trainees) and virtual tools (e.g., web-based instruction, videoconferencing and social media)
to ensure that trainees receive individual and continuous attention for several years as a cohort of learners;
and 5) continuously evaluating the program and its implementation to allow for quality improvement and mid-
course corrections.
 The UAB STEP-UP Coordinating Center will select motivated, promising undergraduate students who
have completed their freshman year and provide them with the organizational, academic and research skills
needed to be competitive. Elements include an intensive mentored research experience for 10 weeks in the
summer (30 hours/week) enhanced by virtual group learning activities (10 hours/week), and followed by
distance learning as part of a virtual learning cohort during Years 1 and 2. This is followed by virtual
maintenance training during Year 3, to maintain interest and investment in the program. During this time,
trainees will develop working relationships with academic researchers and will be involved with the processes
and products of cutting-edge research. Although intensive training is provided only during the summer, we
have designed a program with a UAB-based Program Manager and on-site Institutional Coordinators, who will
help ensure that trainees remain connected to the program through virtual learning approaches and social
media platforms throughout the entire year. They will facilitate contact for training, continued mentoring,
evaluation and â€“ importantly â€“ to maintain connection with the program.","Project Narrative

Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC) is to build on the existing infrastructure to facilitate
academic-community engagement between investigators and stakeholders across the state of Alabama in order
to reduce obesity related health disparities between African American and Whites. The ACED Core will implement
initiatives and targeted communications to disseminate findings based on our proposed OHDRC approach and
framework taking into account stages in the life course, as well as the levels of influence (i.e., individual,
interpersonal, community and societal). Specifically, the ACED will: 1) Strengthen and expand existing
partnerships and coalitions to build statewide capacity for expansion of an integrated set of initiatives for obesity
reduction through healthy eating and physical activity; 2) Implement a â€œtrain-the-trainerâ€ model to replicate
healthy eating and active living initiatives designed to serve as engaged dissemination strategies aimed at
individual, community and system-level changes across the life course; 3) Conduct targeted dissemination of
research-based obesity-related health disparities information using mass and targeted diffusion via
communication channels and established stakeholder groups; 4) Assist OHDRC pilot and research project
investigators in identifying and partnering with community organizations to inform their research and disseminate
findings and 5) Continuously monitor and assess the outcomes of engagement and dissemination activities.

5U54MD000502-17,Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC),"Obesity is among the most prevalent, costly and preventable of health problems. African Americans are 15%
more likely to suffer from obesity than Whites and 70% of African Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 are
overweight or obese. Obesity also places a disproportionate chronic disease burden on African Americans. Our
overall goal is to establish the UAB Obesity Health Disparities Research Center of Excellence (OHDRC) with
an ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating disparities in obesity between African Americans and whites. Using
Alabama as a model, the OHDRC will support transdisciplinary, multi-level, multi-domain research on obesity-
related health disparities to understand the complex contributors to obesity and how they vary at critical periods
across the life course and develop interventions to address these contributors.
To achieve this goal, we will 1) Conduct innovative interdisciplinary research to understand the complex
interactions between biological, behavioral and social factors associated with obesity-related health disparities
throughout the life course (two full projects); 2) Partner with the community to inform research and disseminate
evidence-based practices designed to result in individual, community and system-level changes to impact
obesity-related health disparities. (Academic-Community Engagement and Dissemination Core- ACED); 3)
Expand the pipeline of innovative research through an Investigator Development Program of mentored pilot
research for early stage investigators. (Investigator Development Core â€“ IDC); and 4) Establish a coordinated
infrastructure to support the proposed research, IDC and ACED Cores by: a) implementing a Common Data
Elements and Measurement Shared Resource to be used by OHDRC researchers, b) designing career
enhancement activities that focus on transdisciplinary obesity health disparities research to prepare
independent investigators (especially those from underrepresented minority groups, in partnership with minority
serving institutions) for productive careers, and c) instituting a monitoring and evaluation process to ensure
achievement of proposed goals. (Administrative Core).
Alabama is particularly well-suited as a setting to pursue these aims. It includes some of the most impoverished
rural counties and inner-city communities in the nation and, as we will highlight, Alabamians suffer from some of
the highest rates of obesity and from some of the most starkly disproportionate outcomes for obesity-related
chronic diseases. If our OHDRC proves successful, we will serve as a model for other states facing similar health
disparities.","The Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham

The overall goal of the Outreach Core of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to implement and evaluate,
Cancer Care Connect, an innovative enhanced care coordination model for cancer survivors that links health
system patient navigators (HSPNs) and survivorship care plans (SCPs) with community-based patient
navigators (CBPNs) to improve satisfaction with care, satisfaction with navigation services, and quality of life
among cancer survivors. The accomplishment of the study's goal will be facilitated by the Partnership's
decade-long history of recruiting, training, and engaging lay community health workers/advisors to promote
age-appropriate cancer screening, healthy lifestyles, and enrollment in cancer clinical trials. The patient
navigation model used by the Partnership has been successful in the context of cancer prevention, and now it
will be expanded to cover the entire cancer continuum, from diagnosis through survivorship. To our knowledge,
this will be the first study to extend patient care coordination from the health system to the community using
community navigation and SCPs. Following a baseline assessment, patients with a HSPN and SCP will be
linked to a CBPN, and the impact of the combined health system-based and community-based navigation will
be evaluated at multiple time points. We anticipate that cancer survivors receiving the Cancer Care Connect
will increase satisfaction with care, increase satisfaction with navigation services, and improved quality of life.Â ","8. PROJECT NARRATIVE

3U54MD000502-17S2,Obesity Health Disparities Research Center (OHDRC),"Obesity is among the most prevalent, costly and preventable of health problems. African Americans are 15%
more likely to suffer from obesity than Whites and 70% of African Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 are
overweight or obese. Obesity also places a disproportionate chronic disease burden on African Americans. Our
overall goal is to establish the UAB Obesity Health Disparities Research Center of Excellence (OHDRC) with
an ultimate goal of reducing and eliminating disparities in obesity between African Americans and whites. Using
Alabama as a model, the OHDRC will support transdisciplinary, multi-level, multi-domain research on obesity-
related health disparities to understand the complex contributors to obesity and how they vary at critical periods
across the life course and develop interventions to address these contributors.
To achieve this goal, we will 1) Conduct innovative interdisciplinary research to understand the complex
interactions between biological, behavioral and social factors associated with obesity-related health disparities
throughout the life course (two full projects); 2) Partner with the community to inform research and disseminate
evidence-based practices designed to result in individual, community and system-level changes to impact
obesity-related health disparities. (Academic-Community Engagement and Dissemination Core- ACED); 3)
Expand the pipeline of innovative research through an Investigator Development Program of mentored pilot
research for early stage investigators. (Investigator Development Core â€“ IDC); and 4) Establish a coordinated
infrastructure to support the proposed research, IDC and ACED Cores by: a) implementing a Common Data
Elements and Measurement Shared Resource to be used by OHDRC researchers, b) designing career
enhancement activities that focus on transdisciplinary obesity health disparities research to prepare
independent investigators (especially those from underrepresented minority groups, in partnership with minority
serving institutions) for productive careers, and c) instituting a monitoring and evaluation process to ensure
achievement of proposed goals. (Administrative Core).
Alabama is particularly well-suited as a setting to pursue these aims. It includes some of the most impoverished
rural counties and inner-city communities in the nation and, as we will highlight, Alabamians suffer from some of

5K25HL136869-03,TRPC4-mediated calcium signals accelerate vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Abstract
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an incurable disease of elevated pulmonary artery pressure that
culminates in death due to right heart failure. The etiology of PAH is comprised of increased vasoconstriction in
resistance arteries and remodeling of the arterial microcirculation. All current therapies for PAH target
vasoconstriction, but patient survival has not improved because remodeling remains irreversible. Thus, there
has been considerable impetus to determine the mediators of remodeling in PAH. Members of the transient
receptor potential (TRP) family ion channels have been implicated as drivers of vascular proliferation and
remodeling in PAH. Our lab has shown that TRPC4, a subtype of the canonical TRP family, increases
mortality and vascular lesion number and severity in PAH. A separate mechanism of hemodynamic
perturbations resulting in turbulent or oscillatory endothelial shear stress has also been associated with
increased vascular resistance and remodeling in PAH. Given that both TRPC4 and shear-induced signals
are linked by the nexus of intracellular calcium, we hypothesize that TRPC4 and shear-mediated endothelial
calcium signals will exacerbate lesion formation in PAH. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to determine the
interaction between TRPC4-dependent endothelial calcium signals and oscillatory shear stress as a driver of
occlusive remodeling in PAH. Determining the underlying basis of vascular remodeling in PAH may lead to a
novel class of PAH therapeutics for extending patient survival and improving quality of life. As a candidate
trained in the quantitative areas of computational modeling and animal physiology at the Center for Lung
Biology, I am well suited to investigate the determinants of vascular remodeling in PAH. Furthermore, the goals
of this award are aligned with my specific career goals of gaining research expertise, education, and
professional skills on my path to career independence. The proposed research plan takes advantage of the
robust institutional environment and considerable expertise in the pathophysiology of PAH. The project mentor,
Dr. Troy Stevens, and additional personnel are well known experts in the fields of endothelial biology, vascular
physiology, and pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, our state-of-the-art laboratories have the requisite
equipment to complete this work.","Project Narrative
Although rare, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with high patient mortality, and current
therapies are inadequate to improve patient survival because they target only vasoconstriction and neglect
another key aspect of the disease: vascular remodeling. Store-operated calcium entry and endothelial shear
stress have been implicated as mediators of vascular remodeling in PAH. Thus, this proposal is designed to
test the hypothesis that store-operated calcium signals at sites of oscillatory endothelial shear stress within the
pulmonary microcirculation accelerate vascular remodeling in PAH.",2019,159548,147730,11818,Other Research-Related,K25,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,366880002,Lung; Rare Diseases,CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL FRANCIS
5I01BX003718-03,"Relationship between circadian disruption, cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling, and heart failure","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the U.S. Among CVDs, heart failure (HF) is a sig-
nificant public health burden contributing not only to human suffering, but also to increasing healthcare expend-
itures. CVDs arise in the setting of complex gene-environment interactions; the underlying genetics within an in-
dividual influences how environmental and hormonal stimuli and stresses affect cardiac function and cause path-
ology. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock is a genetically-programmed intrinsic cell-autonomous molecular
mechanism that allows the heart to anticipate environmental stimuli and stresses and subsequently facilitates
responses essential for maintaining cardiac function. Disruption of the circadian clock mechanism in mice and
humans (e.g., through genetic polymorphisms or environmental alterations such as shift work, sleep disturbance,
or eating behavior modulation) negatively impact cardiometabolic health. Furthermore, germline deletion of
BMAL1, a core transcription factor component of the clock mechanism, yields an age onset dilated cardiomyo-
pathy and reduced lifespan. We recently found that BMAL1 deletion specifically from cardiomyocytes
(CBK mouse) recapitulates this pathologic phenotype, exposing an essential role for the clock in the
heart. However, the mechanism by which cardiomyocyte circadian clock disruption leads to cardiomyopathy is
unknown. Multiple endocrine system components are circadian. Evidence is emerging that cell autonomous cir-
cadian clocks not only drive the temporal secretion of hormones, but also modulate time-of-day-dependent target
tissue sensitivity to these hormones. In doing so, circadian clocks add a new layer to homeostasis; not only do
the level of, and the sensitivity to, a stimulus play an important role, but also the timing. Circulating levels of the
pituitary hormone, growth hormone (GH), exhibit notable circadian rhythm in humans. In contrast, nothing is
known about rhythms in GH sensitivity. Chronic GH elevation yields cardiomegaly and HF. GH exerts many of
its biological actions by inducing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1); a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-specific
IGF-1 overexpression results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our recent preliminary data suggest time-of-day-
dependent oscillation of GH sensitivity in the heart, which depends on the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. More-
over, CBK hearts exhibit greater GH sensitivity, with elevated cardiac IGF-1 gene expression, cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy, and HF. Together, these observations lead us to hypothesize that the cardiomyocyte circa-
dian clock modulates GH sensitivity, and that disruption of this mechanism confers local IGF-1-mediated
cardiac hypertrophy and HF via augmented GH sensitivity. Accordingly, we will test the hypotheses that:
Aim 1. Cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulation of GH sensitivity is essential for maintenance of
cardiac function. We will determine whether: 1A. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock modulates sensitivity of
the heart to GH in a time-of-day-dependent manner (physiology); 1B. Genetic disruption of the cardiomyocyte
circadian clock imbalances the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis, thereby precipitating cardiomyopathy (pathology).
Aim 2. Disruption of circadian behaviors/environmental parameters (e.g., fasting/feeding and light/dark
cycles) augments cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling, thereby predisposing to contractile dysfunction. We will
determine whether: 2A. Manipulation of circadian behavior (e.g., fasting/feeding cycles) or environment (e.g.,
light/dark cycle) impact GH sensitivity and GH/IGF-1 signaling in the heart; 2B. Restoration of GH/IGF-1 signaling
in the heart following environmental/behavioral manipulations attenuates susceptibility to contractile dysfunction.
Our studies will identify mechanisms linking cardiomyocyte circadian clock dysfunction to augmented
cardiac GH/IGF-1 signaling. As age-associated CBK cardiomyopathy has similarity with that seen in GH
excess, our studies may foster the novel concept that both GH excess and enhanced GH sensitivity un-
derlie cardiac dysfunction induced by common circadian perturbations (e.g., diet, light exposure, sleep),
and provide sound rationale for future therapeutic strategies targeting the GH/IGF-1 signaling axis in HF.","Heart disease, including heart failure, is a major national health problem, accounting for substantial human
suffering and large health care expenditures. Veterans suffer disproportionately from heart disease. Reasons for
these findings are not yet clear. One potential factor underlying heart disease is the disruption of the normal
time-of-day (circadian) hormonal rhythms that increasingly characterizes our modern lifestyle (shift-work, sleep
disturbance, altered diet). The proposed novel research explores the relationship between circadian disturbance
in the heart, altered local heart hormone actions, and the development of heart failure. Although this work will be
performed in mice, it has large implications for human, especially Veteran, health, particularly because it is likely
that new heart failure prevention and treatment strategies will emerge that target the abnormal growth hormone
(GH) action in the heart that we observe and will decipher.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,Stuart J Frank

Since our DRTC/DRCâ€™s inception in 2008, the P&F program has been critical for growth in Center membership
and extramural funding. Our P&F Program was instituted to tap growing interest in diabetes-related research at
UAB and to foster development of junior faculty members, create partnerships, and take advantage of core
resources. Our RFAs have attracted applications across the spectrum of translational research, yielding a
diverse group of funded proposals â€“ including both clinical and basic research from both junior and senior
investigators. To date, we have funded 55 diabetes-related pilot awards (out of 305 proposals submitted), 44%
of which were clinical research projects and 65% of which were to junior investigators. Despite a reduced
overall P&F Program budget awarded for the current cycle (2012-present), our program has remained vibrant,
albeit with a 26% reduced number of awards funded per year and a 15% reduced average award size over this
period. For the upcoming period, our specific aims are:
 1) To identify and support new research projects of outstanding quality and innovation for pilot funding,
ultimately resulting in substantial extramural support for developing these new lines of investigation;
 2) To support promising junior faculty in career development through funding of outstanding pilots;
 3) To augment the breadth and quality of DRC research by funding innovative projects of established
researchers with valuable expertise who are new to diabetes, or of established diabetes investigators who want
to test new high-impact hypotheses; and
 4) To increase the number of independent investigators in the DRC funded by NIH for diabetes research.
 Our success is evidenced by the fact that nearly 70% of P&F awardees over the period of our DRTC/DRC
program (2008 to present) has achieved substantial external funding for this research; this fraction is even
greater (~83%) when we consider only the initial six years of the program. Greater than 90% of P&F awardees,
including some not originally engaged in diabetes-related research, remain involved in diabetes investigation.

5R01DK107441-04,A Novel Role for IGF-1 Receptor in Growth Hormone Action,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth hormone (GH) regulates growth and metabolism by binding GH receptor (GHR), a cytokine receptor superfamily member, in target tissues. This activates the GHR-associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2, and several signaling systems including STAT5. An important GH-induced outcome in some cell types is STAT5-mediated expression of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 gene and IGF-1 secretion. For six decades, our appreciation of GH physiology has been influenced by the somatomedin hypothesis, which held that GH-induced hepatically-derived circulating endocrine IGF-1 (aka somatomedin-C) mediates GH's somatogenic actions. Indeed, IGF-1 acts via the type 1 IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) to transmit tyrosine-kinase-mediated anabolic signals. However, our novel findings suggest IGF-1R also functions in relevant cell types (preadipocytes, islet ï¢-cells, osteoblasts, prostate cancer cells) as a proximal GHR-interacting element to augment GH sensitivity, even absent IGF-1 binding. Specifically, we find GH acutely promotes IGF-1R association with GHR and that IGF-1R deletion reduces acute GH signaling and consequent IGF-1 gene expression. IGF-1R reconstitution in IGF-1R-deleted cells rescues GH responsiveness in a fashion that depends on IGF-1R extracellular domain (ECD) elements. Further, a recombinantly-produced soluble IGF-1R ECD fragment containing these elements binds GHR in response to GH and blunts GH-induced signaling and gene expression in a dominant-negative fashion. Supporting our findings, recent reports indicate overlap in the metabolic phenotypes of mice with islet ï¢-cell-specific deletion of either GHR or IGF-1R, suggesting GHR-IGF-1R interaction is physiologically relevant in cell types that coexpress the receptors, unlike liver that is heavily endowed with GHR, but nearly devoid of IGF-1R. We hypothesize: 1) IGF-1R, by virtue of specific interaction with GHR, augments GH-induced somatogenic and metabolic signaling in a physiologically-relevant fashion. 2) Modulation of GHR-IGF-1R interaction could be a therapeutically-relevant target to promote or inhibit GH actions, particularly in non-hepatic tissues that express IGF-1R and when IGF-1R is aberrantly expressed in liver. Specific aims: 1) Define elements in IGF-1R that allow transmembrane-anchored IGF-1R to augment GH signaling; 2) Uncover specific modulators of GH action based on dominant-negative effects of soluble IGF-1R on GH signaling; 3) Examine functional effects of IGF-1R on GHR action in liver and pancreatic ï¢-cells in in vivo systems. Proposed studies address a fundamentally novel hypothesis about how GH-induced GHR action is influenced by physical and functional coupling of GHR with IGF-1R and IGF-1R-associated molecules. Our discoveries will enrich the ""linear"" GHï€´GHRï€´IGF-1ï€´IGF-1R pathway (somatomedin hypothesis), suggesting ""parallel"" GHR/IGF-1R-mediated effects, especially in extrahepatic GH action. Relationships of this work with aspects of metabolic regulation and other areas, including growth disorders and cancer biology, could be many and our results may suggest novel strategies to modulate GH action.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growth hormone is a key regulator of growth and metabolism that is known to exert some of its actions by promoting production and actions of insulin-like growth factor-1. These studies examine new mechanistic hypotheses about how growth hormone mediates some of its activities by causing the growth hormone receptor to physically and functionally interact with the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor.

have broad relevance in our understanding of normal physiology and of the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases.",2019,330750,225000,105750,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology,Stuart J Frank
5R21AG056265-02,Electrical Impedance-Based Wearable Device for Monitoring Inflammation in Knee Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older
adults, affecting more than 12% of the total US population and as many as 90% of persons over 65. As the
population ages, prevalence of OA is rising sharply; it is projected that by 2030, 1 in 40 Americans will have
arthritis, the majority of cases being OA. For those already living with OA, the capacity to monitor symptoms
and identify exacerbating factors would significantly improve quality of life. However, current techniques for
characterizing and monitoring OA-related inflammation fail to deliver a cost effective and simple solution that
can be widely used by patients for continuous self-monitoring. In this study we propose developing a wearable
to collect quantitative information on inflammation which have the potential to monitor disease progression
without costly and invasive technologies. Such devices have strong potential to provide OA patients and
providers with insight into the origins of pain and other symptoms and factors that may influence progression of
the disease. First we will engage consumer input from practitioners and OA patients to identify their human fac-
tors necessary for adoption of the wearable device. Second, we will devise and test a device that collects lo-
calized electrical impedance measures of the knee, previously shown able to differentiate between groups with
and without OA, in laboratory conditions to validate its operation. Finally, executing a small-scale field trial to
test user acceptance and collect preliminary data linking observed variability in inflammatory biomarkers to

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among

disability, and progression of the disease. However, there are currently no feasible methods for ambulatory
monitoring of joint inflammation. This project therefore will develop and test a wearable device using bio-
impedance (electrical resistance) to assess inflammation of the knee joint among persons with knee OA. By
clarifying how localized impedance changes are associated with short-term changes in pain and other OA

1R01FD006368-01A1,Ph1 Study of HSV G207 in Pediatric Malignant Cerebellar Tumors IND 16294 01/05/18.,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Childhood brain cancer is the most common solid tumor in children affecting approximately 2,500 children
a year with an estimated 22,000 children living in the United States with a malignant brain tumor, which
establishes this as an orphan disease. Current therapies for malignant childhood brain tumors including surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation are very damaging to the developing brain of a child and can result in significant
long-term disabilities such as cognitive difficulties, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and neurosensory deficits in
survivors. Approximately 30-40% of children with malignant brain cancer do not survive, and high-grade tumors
that recur after current therapies are uniformly fatal. Therefore, novel therapies which target tumor cells while
sparing normal cells and stimulate an anti-tumor immune response are desperately needed.
 Oncolytic engineered herpes simplex virus (oHSV) therapy offers an inventive, targeted, less-toxic
approach for children with incurable brain tumors and may afford an improved margin of safety as an adjuvant
therapy for curable tumors allowing for lower doses and less toxicity from traditional therapies. HSV has been
successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus (e.g. Î³134.5 neurovirulence gene) that prevent
infection in normal brain cells while maintaining the virusâ€™ ability to kill cancer cells and stimulate an anti-tumor
immune response. UAB conducted 3 Phase I trials of oHSV G207, which has both copies of Î³134.5 deleted and
an insertional deletion of the ribonucleotide reductase gene for added safety, given alone and with a single small
dose of radiation to enhance virus replication and an anti-tumor immune response, in adults with recurrent high-
grade glioma. These trials conclusively demonstrated safety of G207 inoculated intratumorally or in surrounding
brain tissue, and â‰ˆhalf of patients had radiographic evidence of tumor response, including two long-term survivors
(>5.5 years). An active pediatric trial of G207 in supratentorial brain tumors has demonstrated safety of G207
alone with evidence of responses to G207 in 7 of 8 patients including a patient >21months post-G207 with an
ongoing response without any additional therapies. These trial data coupled with our preclinical data
demonstrating that aggressive pediatric brain tumors are highly sensitive to G207 and the lack of available
therapies for patients strongly support an oHSV trial for children with progressive malignant cerebellar tumors.
 We propose to conduct a Phase I clinical trial of G207 alone and combined with a single low dose of
radiation in children with recurrent cerebellar brain tumors. We hypothesize that G207 will be safe and tolerable
with evidence of efficacy in children with refractory cerebellar malignancies. Our primary goal is to determine
safety. Our secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response
to G207 and on tumor genotypic and phenotypic features which may predict a response to oHSV. Importantly,
this trial will support the clinical development of G207 for use in this devastating orphan disease.","Project Narrative:

1R21AI146969-01,Mechanistic understanding of SH3 domain-containing protein function in alphavirus replication,"Alphaviruses are divided into distinct, geographically isolated groups, the New World (NW) and Old World
(OW) alphaviruses. Different alphavirus species display adaptations specific to particular hosts and mosquito
vectors and induce diverse diseases in humans and other mammals. These adaptations are driven by the
evolution of viral structural genes, which has resulted in the formation of six major alphavirus serocomplexes.
Evolution of the nonstructural proteins nsP1, nsP2 and nsP4 is restricted by their enzymatic activities in RNA
replication, which have been well characterized. However, functions of nsP3 in alphavirus biology, besides
knowing that this protein is an essential component of replication complexes, are less understood. The amino-
terminal fragment of nsP3 demonstrates a high level of conservation between alphavirus species. The
carboxy-terminal domain is highly phosphorylated, exhibits a very low level of sequence identity between
alphaviruses, and is thusly referred to as the hypervariable domain or HVD. Our recent NMR studies have
demonstrated that nsP3-specific HVD of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is disordered. It contains linear motifs that
interact with a distinct set of protein factors, and these interactions are indispensable for CHIKV replication.
Most of the interacting host factors are represented by protein families, where each member is capable of
supporting viral RNA replication. Another level of redundancy is achieved by the abilities of some of the
interacting protein families to independently mediate viral replication complex formation. Our central hypothesis
is that cellular nsP3 HVD-binding proteins mediate assembly of CHIKV replication complexes. In the proposed
research, we intend to investigate the mechanism of CHIKV HVD interactions with cellular SH3 domain-
containing proteins, with the main focus on the CD2AP protein. This interaction plays a pro-viral role in CHIKV
replication in vertebrate cells and is more critical for viral replication in mosquito cells. By using a variety of
biochemical and NMR-based approaches, we will precisely define binding sites for BIN1, CD2AP and
SH3KBP1 in CHIKV HVD, analyze localization of BIN1-, CD2AP- and SH3KBP1-HVD complexes in the
infected cells and define the role of SH3 domain containing proteins in different steps of CHIKV replication. Our
future studies will result in development of new means of therapeutic treatment and attenuated vaccine
candidates that cannot be transmitted by mosquitoes.","This research proposal is aimed at investigating the mechanisms of nsP3 HVD function in

5R01AI118867-05,Alphavirus nsP3 protein: roles of intrinsically disordered region in virus replication and pathogenesis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family contains over 30 members, many of which represent an unquestionable, but often underappreciated, public health threat. In spite of the ability of alphaviruses to cause broad epidemics and severe human diseases, no efficient vaccines or therapeutic means have been developed against any alphavirus infections. This is primarily a result of our insufficient knowledge of their biology, mechanism of replication and interaction with the host. Alphavirus-host cell interaction is particularly poorly understood. In our recent studies, we have made new steps towards understanding functions of one of four alphavirus nonstructural proteins, nsP3. This protein has unique structural characteristics and so far, no functions have yet been assigned to it. Our preliminary data demonstrate that alphavirus nsP3 exhibits both common and virus- and host-specific functions in adaptation of cellular environment for efficient virus replication. These functions are mediated by its carboxy terminal, hypervariable domain, which is intrinsically disordered and thus, can interact with a wide range of host factors. In the research covered by this proposal, we will use a combination of biochemical, molecular and virological methods to characterize cellular proteins interacting primarily with the nsP3 of encephalitogenic Venezuelan equine encephalitis and eastern equine encephalitis viruses. We will perform detailed mechanistic studies of the nsP3-host protein complexes and delineate their functions in virus-specific modifications of the intracellular environment and defining viral pathogenesis. Investigation of the mechanism of the nsP3 functions will have a strong impact on understanding alphavirus replication and will provide new targets for development of antiviral therapy and new approaches for rational design of alphavirus vaccines candidates.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research proposal is aimed at investigating alphavirus nonstructural protein nsP3 having the least understood functions in virus replication.

5R01AI133159-03,Mechanistic role of ns2 protein in evasion of innate immune response by alphaviruses,"Alphaviruses are an important group of human and animal pathogens that are widely
distributed on all continents. Until recently, the importance of the Old World alphaviruses
in global human health was strongly underestimated. However, recent outbreaks of
chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in India, Italy, East Africa's coastal islands and most recently
on the Caribbean islands, South and Central America, Oceania have highlighted the risk
posed by this virus. Our previous studies have unambiguously demonstrated that the
Old World alphaviruses employ their nonstructural protein nsP2 to re-direct the cellular
transcription coupled repair pathway for degradation of the catalytic subunit of the DNA-
dependent RNA polymerase II, RPB1, and thus, to completely inhibit cellular
transcription. Within a few hours post infection, virus-induced transcriptional shutoff
makes the cells incapable of initiating an antiviral response and leads to development of
cytopathic effect. Thus, the Old World alphavirus nsP2 is the major determinant of
pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. We have also demonstrated that the
transcription inhibitory functions of nsP2 are determined not by its proteolytic activity, but
by the ability of this protein to function as a helicase, and by its S-adenosyl-L-
methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase-like (SAM-like) domain. Two specific
aims of the proposed research plan are focused on i) mechanistic understanding of the
nsP2 helicase domain function in stalling cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II
and ii) on identification of cellular proteins that interact with the SAM-like domain of
nsP2. We will also define the mechanistic role of the interactions of the latter domain in
transcription inhibition. In our preliminary studies, we have developed a set of CHIKV
variants with mutated nsP2, which are incapable of interfering with development of the
innate immune response to CHIKV replication. These irreversible mutations had no
detectable effect on the rates of CHIKV replication in cells defective in type I IFN
signaling, but are cleared from IFN-competent cells without development of cytopathic
effect. Therefore, in the third specific aim, we intend to assess the potential of these
nsP2 mutants to improve the safety of the currently available experimental vaccine
CHIKV 181/25.","The research proposal is aimed at investigating the mechanisms of innate immune

5R01HL102371-07,A Novel Proteolytic System of Pulmonary Inflammation,"PROJECT SUMMARY: In what some have described as a paradigm change, we found that the
matrikine proline-glycine-proline (PGP), a collagen derived peptide, regulates neutrophil influx in
chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). The aims of the previous cycle of this grant
focused on the proteolytic pathway responsible for the generation of PGP and the impact of this
generation system in CF lung disease. The current project examines a novel mechanism of
PGP degradation in CF, a finding rooted in a manuscript in Science, which shows that this
action is carried out by the aminopeptidase activity of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). We
present recent data which demonstrates that the aminopeptidase activity is significantly
reduced, and consequently PGP is increased, in CF lung disease by two discrete mechanisms:
(1) chemical alteration of enzymatic activity by modifications by the reactive aldehyde acrolein
and (2) proteolytic degradation by the serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE). Based on these
findings we propose the following aims: the first will examine the method by which acrolein and
NE inactivate LTA4H aminopeptidase activity, by using mass spectrometry to assess residues
altered by acrolein and cleavage products generated by NE (Aim 1). Next we examine if
bacterial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a key pathogen in CF lung disease,
modulates LTA4H aminopeptidase activity and if alterations in LTA4H aminopeptidase function
(by either pharmacologic or genetic methods) impact bacterial colonization (Aim 2). Aim 3
utilizes the beta ENaC overexpressor mouse, a model of the chronic neutrophilic inflammation
observed in CF lung disease. Initial observations demonstrate a progressive accumulation of
PGP peptides as these mice age and in association with a progressive loss of LTA4H
aminopeptidase activity. These mice also demonstrate increased LTB4 levels due to increased
LTA4H epoxy hydrolase activity. For this aim, we will modulate each of these enzymatic
activities by utilizing an epoxy hydrolase specific inhibitor (RS74), a compound to enhance
LTA4H aminopeptidase activity (4-MDM), or both compounds in combination. Aim 4 will focus
on examining PGP levels, as well as LTA4H levels and aminopeptidase activity, in patients
colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We anticipate the data generated from these aims
will provide clear evidence of a novel host-pathogen interplay, leading to loss of LTA4H
aminopeptidase activity and increased neutrophilic inflammation. The successful completion of
these aims will provide a mechanistic understanding of this dysfunction and new therapeutic
approaches to targeting these pathways in CF lung disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Training Program in Lung Biology and Translational Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) provides multidisciplinary training in a stimulating and collaborative environment that nurtures the development of highly competent and innovative biomedical research scientists. This Program, initiated in 2010 to train M.D. or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows in lung-related research, is currentl in its 4th year with a current allocation of 5 trainees (2-3-4-5-5, for years 1-5). In the first 3. years of the Program, we have graduated three trainees, all in academic research positions, two of the three are in full-time academic research faculty positions and the third receiving advanced post-doctoral training at another institution; with five additional trainees currently in the Progrm. The multidisciplinary and translational approach to the proposed training has been highly successful, and is highlighted by a diverse and interactive group of thirty faculty mentors who hold primary appointments in eight UAB Departments (4 - basic science; 4 - clinical). This includes the successful transition of ""junior mentors"" to the regular faculty mentoring pool. The faculty mentors are grouped into three thematic areas based on scientific expertise: (1) immunology-microbiology; (2) cell biology-tissue repair; (3) translational sciences. Translational research in statistical genetics, computational biology, biomarker discovery, and drug discovery/development and clinical trials (group 3) will facilitate the clinical translation of basc science research (groups 1 and 2). Based on the existing expertise and ongoing research efforts at UAB, training will focus on the manifestations, diagnosis, risk/prognostic stratificatio, mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of lung diseases, primarily acute lung injury (ALI), cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Training programs will be highly individualized and tailored to maximize success of each trainee with the creation of individual development plans (IDPs). In addition to the research projects that will be conducted in the mentor's laboratory, training will encompass a highly structured didactic program that includes weekly teaching conferences in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, a ""survival skills"" curriculum (in collaboration with the UAB Office of Postdoctoral Education) and a Research Core Curriculum that includes emerging themes such as cellular plasticity, drug discovery/development, ""big data"", computational biology, and personalized medicine. Formal instruction will include the responsible and ethical conduct of research. A priority in the next phase of this Program is the recruitment/retention of underrepresented minorities, and maintaining the current high-rate of trainee retention in academic biomedical research careers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R21OH011208-02,The Low Back Cumulative Trauma Index:A Fatigue-Failure Based Risk Assessment Tool,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Occupational musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are widespread in the United States and are a major
cause of disability and lost workdays. These disorders incur tremendous monetary and societal costs, the
magnitude of which is only overshadowed by the pain and disability of those who suffer their effects.
Physical MSD risk factors are known to include high force demands, repetitive exertions, adoption of
non- neutral postures, and vibration exposure. These risk factors traditionally have been assumed to
influence MSDs in independent fashion. However, recent evidence has demonstrated a consistent pattern
of interaction between force and repetition that appears to be associated with risk for a wide variety of
MSDs. The observed pattern of interaction may be indicative of a causal fatigue failure process in
musculoskeletal tissues. If true, important implications follow that may transform our understanding of
MSD etiology and may greatly improve MSD risk assessment.
The aims of this project are to utilize several precepts of fatigue failure theory in an attempt to better
assess the risk of the most common and costly MSD --- low back pain (LBP). We hypothesize that the
effect of biomechanical loading on the tissues of the spine (and therefore LBP risk) will align with
predictions based on fatigue failure theory â€“ for example, that each repetition experienced at high levels of
loading will cause exponentially greater tissue damage than those at low load levels. Furthermore, we
hypothesize that fatigue failure techniques used to assess the impact of variable loading regimens (e.g.,
the Palmgren-Miner rule) can be used to develop an index of cumulative loading on spinal tissues that will
positively correlate with LBP risk.
These hypotheses will be addressed via the following Specific Aims: (1) To develop and validate a
wireless sensor system that can be used to estimate cumulative lumbar loads in occupational settings; and
(2) To evaluate the efficacy of the fatigue failure-based low back cumulative trauma Index (LBCTI) in a
cross-sectional epidemiology study and to use these data to inform levels of risk for a practitioner-friendly
software application designed to assess LBP risk using fatigue failure theory.
!!!!!
This proposal addresses the MSD Cross-Sector and virtually all industry sectors. The proposal is
expected to contribute to these sectors through improved risk assessment techniques for (and perhaps
improved understanding of the causality of) LBP, which may lead to better methods of controlling these
injuries. The main r2P contribution of this application is in the development of more highly effective
prevention practices through improved understanding of the effects of cumulative spinal loading on LBP.
Outputs of the proposal will include journal and conference publications, and development of a
practitioner-friendly software application to assess LBP risk using fatigue failure principles. Intermediate
outcomes include the potential for changes in the MSD exposure assessment methodology by ergonomics
researchers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This application is relevant to occupational safety and health as it introduces a new paradigm for evaluating
risk of work-related low back pain (LBP) based on evidence of an underlying (and possibly causal) fatigue
failure process. Evidence further suggests that this paradigm may be applicable to risk assessment for a wide
range of other musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), disorders responsible for a tremendous amount of worker
disability and huge societal costs. This application addresses two key NIOSH MSD Cross Sector Strategic

understanding of causal mechanisms.",2019,179944,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,368325888,,Gerard A Davis; Sean  Gallagher
5R21DA043960-02,Bile acid signaling as a pharmacological target for the treatment of cocaine abuse,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Substance abuse (e.g. cocaine) evolved to hijack a system already in place to respond to natural, adaptive
rewards such as calorie-dense foods. It should therefore come as little surprise that robust crosstalk between
food and abused substances may be observed in neuronal responses and adaptations, circuits, and even
hormonal regulators. Cocaine abuse and addiction is a crushing public health problem that medical approaches
have resoundingly failed to address â€“ new ideas and targets are sorely needed.
 Our group discovered that a novel gut-based weight-loss surgery (biliary diversion) alters neuronal responses
to cocaine, including behavioral measures of cocaine reward. Biliary diversion is capable of chronically elevating
circulating bile acids through ligation of the common bile duct and anastomosis of the gallbladder to the ileum
(GB-IL). In the control surgery, the gallbladder is anastomosed to the duodenum (GB-D), restoring normal bile
flow. Bile acids act as steroid hormones with targets in the brain, including the G protein-coupled bile acid
receptor 1 (TGR5) which is expressed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc).
 Biliary diversion was recently developed at Vanderbilt University to treat high fat diet-induced obesity in mice.
GB-IL mice exhibited weight loss and reduced high fat food consumption as compared to GB-D animals. Notably,
the weight loss and decreased caloric intake occurred only in animals fed a high fat diet and not in animals fed
a regular chow diet. Thus, we hypothesized that this reduction in the intake of rewarding, calorically-dense food
could stem, at least in part, from altered reward for palatable food (hedonic eating).
 Reward is a process regulated by mesolimbic dopamine (DA). Dysregulated mesolimbic DA circuitry has been
linked to high fat, high calorie food consumption and, importantly, to cocaine abuse. Thus, understanding how
to prevent or correct this dysregulation, is pivotal for developing treatments for cocaine abuse. This proposal
stems from the observation that GB-IL, which reduces high fat intake and increases circulating bile acids, also
reduces the reinforcing properties of cocaine and impairs the ability of cocaine to enhance released DA.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that GB-IL and central bile acid signaling regulate cocaine behaviors by
impairing cocaine-induced changes in accumbal DA neurotransmission. This hypothesis will be tested within the
two Specific Aims below:
Aim 1: To determine the neuroadaptations induced by GB-IL and GB-D (control surgery) to accumbal DA
homeostasis and to cocaine-induced increase in extracellular DA.
Aim 2: To determine the role of GB-IL and central bile acids signaling in modulating cocaine behaviors.","Project Narrative
The gut-to-brain axis regulates diverse behavioral phenotypes. We reveal that a new gut-based bariatric surgical
approach chronically elevates systemic bile acids and reduces cocaine reward. These findings redefine the
physiological significance of bile acid signaling and highlight the importance of determining whether bile acid
analogues represent a viable pharmacological treatment for cocaine abuse.",2019,186617,150549,36068,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute on Drug Abuse,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Digestive Diseases; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Liver Disease; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention; Substance Abuse,CHARLES R FLYNN; AURELIO  GALLI
2R01DA035263-07,The dopamine transporter's lipid interactions:  understanding transporter function,"Amphetamines (AMPHs) are psychostimulants commonly used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. attention deficit disorders). They are also abused, with devastating outcomes. The abuse potential of AMPHs has been associated with their ability to cause mobilization of cytoplasmic dopamine (DA), which leads to an increase in extracellular DA levels. This increase is mediated by the reversal of the DA transporter (DAT) function that causes non-vesicular DA release, herein defined as DA efflux. However, the molecular events underlying DA efflux and how these events translate to specific AMPH behaviors is not well understood and is the focus of this proposal. We have shown that the DAT N-terminus (NT) is a structural domain that upon phosphorylation supports AMPH-induced DA efflux, but does not regulate DA uptake. Also, our preliminary data indicate that this phosphorylation event regulates DA-associated behaviors. Previously, using a combination of biochemistry, electrophysiology, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, as well as behavioral assays, we have shown that the DAT NT contains structural elements (Lys) that interact with plasma membrane lipids, specifically, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). Impairing
the interaction of the DAT NT with PIP2, either pharmacologically or molecularly, inhibits both DA efflux and AMPH hyperlocomotion. This was the first demonstration that the interaction of a plasma membrane protein with PIP2 is essential for psychostimulant behaviors. It also raised the possibility, that this interaction is essential for AMPH to cause DAT NT phosphorylation. DA efflux also requires the NT to be present and highly dynamic, since either anchoring the DAT NT to the plasma membrane or deleting the NT impairs DA efflux, but not DA uptake. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that the interaction between the NT and PIP2 is pivotal for AMPH to cause NT phosphorylation. Upon phosphorylation, the DAT NT uncouples from PIP2 and disengages from the membrane, forming new interactions with a specific motif of intracellular loop 4 (IL4) as predicted by our preliminary data. These new interactions, facilitated by NT phosphorylation, are essential for AMPH actions. We propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) To determine the role of hDAT-plasma membrane interactions in regulating NT phosphorylation; 2) To determine how hDAT NT phosphorylation supports DA efflux and the involvement of IL4. Our molecular discoveries will be then translated in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model in which we express the human DAT (hDAT) in DA neurons of flies lacking the Drosophila DAT (â€œhumanized fliesâ€). In this animal model, we developed the ability to study hDAT function in isolated brains, both biochemically and biophysically, and to determine whether molecular manipulations of hDAT impairing DA efflux, but not uptake, impair complex behaviors associated with AMPH, including reward/preference. Therefore, in specific aim 3) we will determine the requirement of hDAT IL4-PIP2 interactions for AMPH-induced behaviors and the role played by NT phosphorylation.","The dopamine transporter is a plasma membrane protein that clears extracellular dopamine once it has been released upon action potential depolarization. The dopamine transporters and related family members are targets for medications, and secondary targets for psychostimulants such as amphetamine. In this proposal, we will combine biochemistry, biophysics, and cell-based assays of transport function with ex vivo analyses of isolated brain of Drosophila and behavioral studies of flies with the intent of understanding the mechanisms underlying the molecular and functional
modifications of the dopamine transporter that support the amphetamine actions.",2019,422652,287645,135007,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Drug Abuse,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Substance Abuse,AURELIO  GALLI; Heinrich J.G.

5R01NS082413-07,Circadian dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease,"Cognitive function varies greatly throughout the day and night due to an intrinsic molecular clock localized
hippocampal cells. In our last project period, we demonstrated that day-night differences in neuronal
excitability, long-term potentiation, and memory are regulated by the circadian clock-controlled mechanisms
such as kinase activation and ion channel regulation, and that excitability of central clock neurons in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus is dysregulated in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known
about the underlying regulation of neuronal excitability by the molecular clock in hippocampus during both
physiological and pathological states. Further investigation of the circadian regulation of passive and active
membrane properties in excitatory pyramidal cells as well as inhibitory, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is
required to discover novel chronotherapeutic strategies for early intervention of hyper-excitability, cognitive
dysfunction, and pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. In this competitive renewal request, we will test the
novel hypotheses that the cell-autonomous molecular clock drives day-night differences in active and passive
membrane properties of pyramidal neurons and PV+ interneurons at opposite times of the day. We predict that
these anti-phase relationships promote day-night differences in excitatory-inhibitory balance, synaptic
plasticity, and memory, and that disruption of circadian regulation of hippocampal membrane properties could
contribute to hyper-excitability of the network and hasten cognitive impairment and pathogenesis. Using
conditional transgenic mice, slice electrophysiology, bioluminescence imaging, chemogenetics, and behavioral
assays, we will test whether rhythmic transcription and excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons (Aim 1) and
parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (Aim 2) are driven by the molecular clock and necessary for day-night
differences in memory and plasticity. Aim 3 will use chemogenetics to determine whether restoration of day-
night differences in the depolarization state and intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons is protective
against Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory impairment. Altogether, these experiments have the
potential to reveal an entirely novel mechanism by which the hippocampal clock regulates day-night
differences in plasticity and cognition and could give critical insight into Alzheimer's disease hyperexcitability,
memory impairment, and pathogenesis.","The mechanisms underlying day-night differences in cognition and memory are unclear. This proposal
investigates the novel hypothesis that the cellular circadian clock is critical for regulation of neural activity at the appropriate time-of-day in different types of neurons in the brain region that controls memory. As a result,

5R01NS108713-02,The Nigral Molecular Clock and Vulnerability to Neurodegeneration,"Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra are particularly susceptible to dysfunction and loss with aging
and disease. A potential contributor to this vulnerability is the requirement for the maintenance of intrinsic
pacemaking activity. However, little is known about how this pacemaking activity is regulated in physiological
and pathological states. Understanding how nigral neurons maintain their firing rate and adapt to cellular
stressors has the potential to reveal novel pathways for prevention of cellular damage and death. In this
application, we are proposing to test the novel hypotheses that the molecular clock is a key regulator of
pacemaking activity and other processes required for normal function of dopaminergic neurons and that
disruption of this clock contributes to cell dysfunction and death in models of Parkinson Disease (PD). In
support of these hypotheses, we have found that dopaminergic neuron firing rate varies with time of day and
that this variation is abolished in mice with midbrain-specific deletion of the obligate transcriptional regulator of
circadian function, Bmal1. Furthermore, we have found day/night differences in the expression of genes
involved in pacemaking activity in the substantia nigra, suggesting that pathways important for nigral function
may be regulated at the transcriptional level by the molecular clock. Interestingly, we have discovered alpha
synuclein mouse models of PD display disrupted day/night differences in pacemaking activity, leading to the
hypothesis that the impairment of circadian-regulated processes could contribute to neuronal dysfunction and
death in disease. In Aim 1, experiments are designed to determine the mechanisms by which the molecular
clock regulates dopaminergic neuron function at the transcriptional, electrophysiological, and behavioral levels,
using recently developed tools to evaluate molecular clock rhythmicity and transcription in a cell-specific way.
In Aim 2, experiments will utilize approaches to reset the molecular clock in a time-of-day-dependent manner in
mice with Î±-synuclein- induced pathology to determine the role for circadian dysregulation in the progression of
Î±-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity and behavioral impairment. Altogether, these experiments have the
potential to reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of nigral function and vulnerability and could give critical
insight into disease progression and pathogenesis.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

FLEX Module Spectralis Tracking OCT System and the Anterior Segment CASIA SS-1000 swept
source OCT will allow us to quantitatively assess the characteristics and health of the retina, RPE,
choroid, and optic nerve head, as well as anterior chamber structures (lens, cornea, iris, trabecular
meshwork) in vivo. Together, these instruments will allow us to quantitatively assess the health,
experimental treatment, damage, recovery, and/or inflammation of ocular tissues and structures
preceding, during, and following a wide array of ocular procedures that are central to the success of the
NIH-funded user group. Thus, this equipment will undoubtedly strengthen the research programs of the
participating faculty and accelerate translation of experimental therapeutics into humans. The
instruments will be housed in a university-wide core facility for ocular phenotyping. The PI has a
demonstrated track record of over 20 years of administration, and of successfully managing core and
departmental services.","Project Narrative
Funds are requested for three shared instruments to greatly improve pre-, intra-, and
post- operative ocular imaging in experimental animals. These instruments will allow
detailed preoperative planning and assessment of baseline values as well as improved
outcomes of intraocular procedures. They will also assure a complete assessment of eye
health for postoperative care and greatly enhance the quantitative assessment of
research and treatment outcomes.",2019,548280,548280,0,Other Research-Related,S10,NIH Office of the Director,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences,Paul Douglas Gamlin
3R01EY025555-04S1,Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and their central projections,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We sense light for a diverse array of functions that include regulation of the circadian clock, pupil diameter,
hormone levels, and alertness. These non-image visual functions are distinguished from visual perception in
that they are insensitive to details in the scene, being driven instead by the absolute level of illumination. Our
goal is to understand the basis of these functions in a diurnal species whose visual system has strong
homologies with that of humans. We focus on the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs),
which respond directly to light using a receptor molecule called melanopsin, while also receiving inputs from
rod- and cone-driven pathways. IpRGCs project their axons from the eye to numerous targets in the brain, with
their two principal targets being the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the master circadian clock, and
the pretectal olivary nucleus (PON), which is a control center for the pupillary light reflex. The clock and pupil
exhibit marked, quantitative differences in their light responses. The clock integrates light over many minutes to
produce an accurate measurement of overall irradiance, which provides a proxy for time of day; by contrast,
the pupil senses light on a time scale of seconds to dynamically regulate the amount of light reaching the
retina. Our broad hypothesis is that signaling mechanisms within the ipRGC system are suited to the
integrative character of non-image vision in a diurnal mammal, and tuned to specific downstream functions. To
test this hypothesis, we will determine the phototransduction mechanisms and spatiotemporal dynamics of
ipRGCs that innervate the SCN or PON; furthermore, we will connect these features to the spatiotemporal
dynamics of SCN and PON neurons. Our experiments rely on a synergy of in vitro and in vivo
neurophysiological techniques. We have established a logistical and technological platform that allows the
ipRGC system to be defined in stepwise fashion across multiple levels of biological organization, from photon
absorption by melanopsin to the chromatic sensitivities of downstream neurons and behavioral outputs. Our
experiments will constitute the first extensive and systematic investigation of the ipRGC system in a diurnal
mammal, and will lay the foundation for a precise understanding of links that have been made between
dysregulation within this system and human diseases that include cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic
disorders, psychiatric disorders, and jet lag. The strong commonalities between our model organism and
humans make the translational relevance of our research especially direct.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

7. Project Summary/Abstract
The Instrumentation Core is a new configuration of two long-standing service modules: the Machine Shop
Module and the Electronics Module. Services previously provided by each module are all still available and
represent some of the main goals and strengths of this Core. In addition, by bringing these two previously
independent modules together under a single directorship, we have instituted greater coordination between
services to facilitate the complex fabrication that is increasingly among the goals of Instrumentation Core
users. For example, this reconfiguration allows for the coordinated design of devices with integrated electro-
mechanical components, which streamlines production by considering structural and electronic features
simultaneously in the initial design phase. Such added goals ensure that the Instrumentation Core is a focal
point where investigators can work with the Core staff as a team to design and improve electro-mechanical
devices that are central to data acquisition for new as well as ongoing experiments. Both the machine shop
and the electronics components of this Core are staffed by highly skilled technicians. Because the machinist is
experienced with on-going scientific projects by Core users, he routinely offers design and materials
recommendations that help to improve and expedite project outcomes. This design process is further facilitated
by the tool and ide makerâ€™s recently acquired Associate degree in computer-aided drafting and design. The
electrical engineer, newly hired during the past year, is completing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical
Engineering at UAB, and consequently will be providing fresh insight into the latest technologies for device
control and signal acquisition. Like his predecessor in this engineering position, his efforts will be additionally
motivated by occasional co-authorship in publications, as warranted. The improved coordination of the Core
staff under a one Director/one Associate Director team is expected to increase effective communication
between Core staff and scientists, leading to increased productivity. At present, the re-configured Core is used
extensively or moderately by 14 of the 23 Core grant participants, of which 8 are NEI R01-funded.",,2019,218591,148497,70094,Research Centers,P30,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Bioengineering; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision,Paul Douglas Gamlin

ABSTRACT
Delivery of therapeutic drugs via the dermal route is a promising alternative to oral or parenteral delivery routes
because dermal drug delivery systems (3DS) offer unique advantages such as controlled drug release over
sustained periods for steady absorption into the systemic circulation, significant reduction in first-pass effects
and gastrointestinal irritation, reduced
dosing frequency and
systemic toxicity, and better patient compliance.
While less than twenty transdermal drugs have been approved in the U.S. since 1979, the number of generic
drugs has steadily grown over the last three decades. Additionally, the market for intradermal delivery systems
is also expanding. Accordingly, the market potential of 3DS, valued at ~$13B in 2005, is expected to reach
~$80B by 2024, with an annual growth rate of 8%. In response to this trend, a physiologically inspired simulation
toolkit that can predict the clinical pharmacokinetic response and therapeutic effect of dermally administered
compounds by optimizing dosage, formulation and administration scenarios (e.g., regimenting) can
complement and accelerate drug development, clinical investigations and regulatory evaluation.
To this end, the overall goal of this project is to develop and deliver a multiscale simulation toolkit for
computational pharmacology of trans/intradermally administered compounds (CPDAC) in healthy and diseased
skin population. During Phase I, we developed a model of healthy skin and linked it with a systems
pharmacology model and predicted the dermal absorption and clinical pharmacokinetics of first generation (Gen-
1) transdermal systems (patches, creams, gels and ointments), and validated with clinical data.
Going into Phase II, we will augment the scope of CPDAC by including additional Gen-1 transdermal systems,
second and third generation (Gen-2 and 3) dermal drug delivery systems in healthy and diseased skin population.
Specifically, we will develop: quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR)-based generalized constructs to
automate the action of chemical penetration enhancers (CPEs) on drug permeation, computational models of
field-assisted iontophoresis (Gen-2) and microneedle-based intradermal drug delivery (Gen-3), which have not
been attempted before. The models will be designed in a modular/parametric form to accommodate subject-
specific physiology, user-defined fidelities of specific skin layers (0D-3D), embedded skin microvasculature. The
models will then be integrated into a â€˜holistic trans/intradermal modelâ€™, which will then be linked to an advanced
in vitro to in vivo correlation (IVIVC)-linked whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic model
(PharmaLab CTS) for predicting the local and systemic pharmacokinetics of drugs, generics and cosmetics
delivered from Gen-1/2/3 systems, in healthy and diseased skin population (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, acne and
keratosis). In collaboration with our preclinical and clinical partners, the models will be systematically calibrated
and validated at each stage of the development process toward delivering a robust, predictive and commercial
quality CPDAC toolkit for end-user evaluation (as GUI to pharma, FDA and therapeutic product developers).

suffering and the social burden caused by diabetes and cardiometabolic disease through innovative,
multidisciplinary, basic and translational research and research training, which advances understanding of
disease mechanisms, prevention, and treatmentâ€. Over 9 years, the DRC has galvanized the UAB research
community around the study of diabetes resulting in increased membership by 69% from 115 to 194 and an
increase in active extramural diabetes research funding to a total of $62,427,510 annual direct costs. Our
centerâ€™s goals are to facilitate excellence in diabetes research, further develop a cohesive intellectual
community promoting collaboration and innovation, and provide an outstanding environment for training and
career development. Our research emphasizes the study of diabetes as both a metabolic and vascular disease
and includes areas of research excellence including molecular signaling, islet biology & autoimmunity,
integrative metabolism vascular disease/inflammation, diabetes complications, genetics & epidemiology, and
interventions & community based research. Our specific aims are to:
 1. Facilitate and enhance diabetes research by sponsoring research core facilities expressly required by our
investigator base and that cover a broad translational spectrum: Bioanalytical REDOX Biology, Animal
Physiology, Human Physiology, and Interventions & Translation Cores.
 2. Augment diabetes research via a pilot & feasibility grant program that will emphasize innovation,
translation, and career development of highly promising junior investigators.
 3. Sponsor an integrated Enrichment Program that promotes a cohesive environment for an outstanding
multi-disciplinary investigator base, which will enhance learning, collaboration, collegiality, and innovation.
 4. Emphasize research, training, and outreach that are responsive to the needs of our trainees, achieve
better outcomes for our patients, and lessen the high burden of diabetes in our community and nation.
 5. Respond to the evolving needs of our investigators and through leadership that impels new ideas and
lines of investigation, and leverage the resolve of UAB leadership, substantial institutional commitments, and
generous philanthropy from our community to further impel the development of a pre-eminent center of
diabetes research excellence in the heart of the Deep South.
 The DRC has exerted a pronounced impact on diabetes research excellence at UAB in a community with
the highest rates of diabetes in the US, and has united investigators around common themes to study diabetes
in the context of cardiometabolic disease. We are confident that further evolution and growth will be achieved
over the next 5 years.","The UAB DRC is the only NIDDK diabetes center located in the Deep South, at the 'Diabetes Belt' epicenter
characterized by the highest rates of diabetes in the US. Through its core facilities, pilot grants, and

the Enrichment & Training Program. The DRC will be directed by W. Timothy Garvey MD, assisted by
associate directors Drs. Barbara Gower and Anath Shalev. The Director and Associate Directors will join other
key DRC faculty in comprising the DRC Action Committee, Drs. Stuart Frank, Scott Ballinger, Douglas
Moellering, Tim Nagy, Andrea Cherrington, and C. Beth Lewis. The ultimate goal of the Admin Core is to
assure the growing vitality of an intellectual community and a highly productive research program in diabetes,
by effective deployment of DRC resources, for the benefit of our members, patients, trainees, and community.
 Operationally, the Core will assure productivity and effectiveness of DRC activities including the biomedical
and translational research core facilities (REDOX Biology, Animal Physiology, Human Physiology,
Interventions & Translation), a pilot & feasibility grant program that promotes research progress of promising
investigators and innovative lines of investigation, and an enrichment program that advances the DRC as an

3P30DK079626-12S1,UAB Diabetes Research Center: Chronic Disease and the Reduction of Health Disparities Supplement,"Diabetes is responsible for a huge and growing burden of patient suffering and social costs, and the impact
of this disease is shared disproportionately by minorities and in rural resource-challenged communities. In
particular, the Alabama Black Belt and the Mississippi delta have the highest rates of diabetes and obesity in the
United States. The need for research targeted to rural populations characterized by a heavy preponderance of
minorities and low socioeconomic status is acutely needed to better understand the basis for health disparities
and to identify effective interventions for diabetes treatment and prevention.
 With this revision application, the UAB Diabetes Research Center (DRC) re-dedicates our center to improving
the health of our patients with diabetes in the Deep South. To extend our scientific reach, we will establish a
primary care clinical network in rural Black Belt counties of Alabama and in the Mississippi delta as a research
resource that will provide the DRC and its members with opportunities for partnership and the infrastructure to
conduct translational and clinical research in those patients with the greatest need. Our specific aims are:
 Aim 1: Establish a Diabetes Primary Care Coalition in the rural Black Belt region of Alabama. Building
upon ongoing projects, we will establish a network of primary care clinics in rural Alabama and eventually expand
to the Mississippi delta as well. The coalition will feature sustainable partnerships, engagement of community
health workers, and a telehealth system for communication with primary care clinic personnel, education,
messaging with patients, and data capture adapted to medical records systems.
 Aim 2: Integrate the Primary Care Coalition and clinical network as a research resource in the DRC.
The clinical network will be facilitated by the Interventions & Translation Core, and the resource will be accessible
to all investigators in our DRC as well as others in our partnering centers and academic institutions. Other DRC
cores will be adapted to facilitate effective hypothesis testing using this resource.
 Aim 3: Conduct a pilot study of an innovative lifestyle program (telehealth + community health
workers) with and without metformin for diabetes prevention. This pilot trial is intended to consolidate and
refine operations within the primary care coalition, and to develop data for a larger scale randomized trial
evaluating a novel and sustainable approach for diabetes prevention that involves an innovative lifestyle
intervention combined with metformin.
 The current revision application underscores the commitment of the DRC to partnerships and research that
is directed at improving health in patients with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease in our communities with a
particular emphasis on health disparities in rural communities. The primary care coalition is designed as a
powerful resource for the study of mechanisms responsible for chronic disease disparities and developing
interventions uniquely effective in these high-risk populations.","Diabetes is responsible for a huge and growing burden of patient suffering and social costs, and the impact

5R01EY028578-02,Effects of wavelength on achieving and maintaining emmetropia,"During postnatal development when the eye is still growing, an â€œemmetropization mechanismâ€ uses the
eyeâ€™s refractive error to regulate the growth of the scleral shell to match the axial length of the eye to the focal
plane. Despite this, in over 40% of Americans and up to 96% of groups in East Asia, the eye becomes too long
for its own optics and is thus myopic. Even low amounts of myopia raise the risk of developing blinding
conditions and refractive surgery does not change this. Thus, effective strategies to slow eye growth and
reduce the prevalence of myopia are needed.
 Maintenance of emmetropia is a neglected area of research. Most myopic children emmetropize relatively
normally, but then are unable to maintain emmetropia in the longer maintenance phase of emmetropia. Our
research in tree shrews (cone-dominated dichromatic mammals closely related to primates) has shown that
maintaining emmetropia is an active process throughout adolescence. Is the eye becoming too short
(hyperopia) and should increase its growth rate to maintain emmetropia (retinal GO signals are needed), or is it
becoming too long (myopia) and should slow the axial elongation rate to maintain emmetropia (retinal STOP
signals are needed). An important problem is that we do not have a solid understanding of the visual cues
used by the emmetropization mechanism to generate STOP signals that will prevent eyes from becoming too
long. In tree shrews, we have discovered that exposure to narrow-band long wavelength (red) light (which only
stimulates the long-wavelength sensitive, or LWS, cones) seems to generate STOP signals that slow growth
during the maintenance phase of emmetropization.
 In specific aim 1, we will determine the optimal parameters for the red light to generate the maximum
STOP signal with minimal exposure and learn if red-light STOP signals show non-linear summation, similar to
other stimuli that generate STOP signals (myopic defocus or interrupted minus-lens wear).
 In specific aim 2, we will determine if the red light â€œtreatmentâ€ can produce consistent STOP signaling over
a long period of time in the maintenance phase of emmetropization. We will also examine if the red light can
counteract the myopiagenic effects of a minus lens in a paradigm similar to that used in myopia-control studies.
 In specific aim 3, we will use both analysis of retinal dopamine, and of gene expression in the retina and
post-retinal signaling cascade, to determine if red-light STOP signals act via the same pathways as other
STOP stimuli (such as recovery from induced myopia), or if the pathways are parallel and novel.
 The knowledge gained from this project will not only generate critical data on the operation of the
emmetropization mechanism during the maintenance phase, but also may result in the development of red
light as a novel anti-myopia therapy.","Myopia (nearsightedness) affects over 40% of the US adult population and about one billion people worldwide,
which is a serious public health issue because the increased eye growth of myopia raises the risk of
developing blinding conditions. We have discovered that narrow-band red light slows eye growth in juvenile
and adolescent tree shrews. This project will examine if the red light acts like optical STOP signals during the
maintenance phase of emmetropization and if it slows lens-induced myopia so that it might become a new tool
to slow myopia development in children.",2019,372695,260787,111908,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Pediatric,TIMOTHY J GAWNE

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is to train outstanding young people in the intellectual discipline of being a scientific investigator and a thoroughly trained physicia. Although the ultimate career pathway for individual trainees may range from the conduct of basic biomedical research to clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents or procedures, the net effect of this cadre of investigators will be to increase the translation of basic biomedical understanding into clinical practice. Our Program aims to 1) offer superb classroom training in both basic science education and the fundamentals of clinical education; 2) train students in the tools necessary to become successful biomedical scientists, including grant and manuscript writing, as well as time and laboratory management; 3) help students obtain the competencies to become excellent physicians, including clinical skills, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, interpersonal communication, professionalism, and evidence-based medicine; and 4) graduate physician-scientists who go on to become leaders in academic medical centers throughout the country. The basic structure of the MSTP curriculum at UAB is similar to most programs with three distinct phases - two years of basic science course work and laboratory rotations in the summers (Pre-clinical Phase), an extended period of laboratory research leading to the PhD (Research Phase), followed by a clinical training leading to the MD degree (Clinical Phase). One key difference in our program is that students take both graduate school coursework and medical school coursework during their first two years and integrate a continuing clinical education experience into their graduate years. Our MSTP students can choose to do their PhD in either multiple theme-based programs; which include cancer biology, pathobiology, immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, genetics, biochemistry, and cell, developmental, and molecular biology or in departmental-based programs; which include biomedical engineering, nutrition, and public health. The average time to complete our program is 7.7 years. The program usually accepts 8 students each year and currently has a total student body of 61 active students.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid advances in biomedical sciences of the past 30 years has resulted in a critical need for well trained investigators who also have direct involvement with clinical Medicine to translate the multiple new discoveries in biomedical science into workable clinical applications. Joint MD/PhD training of the most outstanding individuals in both modern medicine and the special intellectual perspective and technical know-how of basic biomedical science is a key component of meeting this need.,2019,827365,814521,39870,"Training, Institutional",T32,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,WILLIAM M GEISLER; Talene Alene Yacoubian
5K24AI125685-04,Midcareer Mentoring Award for Patient-Oriented Research in Chlamydia trachomatis Infection,"William M. Geisler, M.D., M.P.H., is a mid-career stage physician scientist at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) with independent federal funding, expertise in Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections, and
significant experience in mentoring early career stage trainees in patient-oriented research (POR). This
midcareer investigator award would enable Dr. Geisler to: 1) further develop his mentoring skills, 2) continue
providing POR mentoring to early career stage trainees, and 3) expand his research program in new directions
by supporting two new research projects. CT infections are highly prevalent in young females (adolescents and
young adults) and can cause significant reproductive morbidity when untreated. Since the majority of CT
infections are asymptomatic, they are often unrecognized and may go untreated. CT detection relies in large
part on screening young females annually. Because provider compliance with CT screening is low and
screening at an annual interval misses many infections that resolve spontaneously or are incidentally treated,
the cumulative burden of CT infection in asymptomatic young females is unknown. Another missed opportunity
for treating CT infection is in females with CT-associated dysuria who are misdiagnosed with a urinary tract
infection (UTI), often prescribed UTI treatment ineffective against CT, and usually not tested for CT.
 With award support, Dr. Geisler plans to expand and refine his mentoring skills through didactics and
training, and to continue mentoring his current early stage trainees and recruit new trainees through multiple
UAB sources. All trainees will be provided with educational and research experiences tailored to their career
stage and interests. With award support, Dr. Geislerâ€™s research program will be augmented through two new
studies addressing missed opportunites for CT detection and treatment, which will provide new opportunities
for mentoring trainees, collaborations, and funding. The Aim of New Study 1 is: Evaluate the cumulative
burden of CT infection in female adolescents and young adults and predictors of higher burden. Females ages
16-29 years will be enrolled at 4 UAB clinics with different patient populations. Subjects will be interviewed and
undergo urine CT testing and serum CT antibody testing. Cumulative burden of CT infection represents
positivity by either test. The Aim of New Study 2 is: Determine the frequency of CT infection in female
adolescents and young adults presenting with dysuria and the patient and urine characteristics that distinguish
CT infection from UTI. Females ages 16-29 years presenting to the UAB Emergency Department with dysuria
will be enrolled, interviewed, undergo urogenital CT testing, and have a urine dipstick and bacterial culture
performed. The long-term goal of Dr. Geislerâ€™s research is to improve prevention and control of CT infection.
Knowledge from the new studies could lead to improve CT screening strategies in young asymptomatic
females and more testing and treatment in females presenting with CT-associated dysuria. The research
studies will provide mentoring opportunities in POR for multiple early stage trainees.","Dr. Geisler is a midcareer physician scientist in the field of infectious diseases who has established a federally
funded chlamydia research program and track record for mentoring early clinical investigators. This midcareer
mentoring award will enable Dr. Geisler to further develop his mentoring skills, continue providing patient-
oriented research mentoring to early career stage trainees, and expand his research program in new directions
by supporting new patient-oriented research projects that are evaluating the burden of chlamydia and a
frequently missed opportunity for chlamydia treatment, chlamydia-associated dysuria in female adolescents
and young adults. Mentoring provided should advance the research careers of many early stage clinical
investigators, and findings from the research could impact chlamydia screening and treatment strategies.",2019,131265,121542,9723,Other Research-Related,K24,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Urologic Diseases,WILLIAM M GEISLER
3T32GM008361-28S1,Medical Scientist Training Program,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is to train outstanding young people in the intellectual discipline of being a scientific investigator and a thoroughly trained physicia. Although the ultimate career pathway for individual trainees may range from the conduct of basic biomedical research to clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents or procedures, the net effect of this cadre of investigators will be to increase the translation of basic biomedical understanding into clinical practice. Our Program aims to 1) offer superb classroom training in both basic science education and the fundamentals of clinical education; 2) train students in the tools necessary to become successful biomedical scientists, including grant and manuscript writing, as well as time and laboratory management; 3) help students obtain the competencies to become excellent physicians, including clinical skills, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, interpersonal communication, professionalism, and evidence-based medicine; and 4) graduate physician-scientists who go on to become leaders in academic medical centers throughout the country. The basic structure of the MSTP curriculum at UAB is similar to most programs with three distinct phases - two years of basic science course work and laboratory rotations in the summers (Pre-clinical Phase), an extended period of laboratory research leading to the PhD (Research Phase), followed by a clinical training leading to the MD degree (Clinical Phase). One key difference in our program is that students take both graduate school coursework and medical school coursework during their first two years and integrate a continuing clinical education experience into their graduate years. Our MSTP students can choose to do their PhD in either multiple theme-based programs; which include cancer biology, pathobiology, immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, genetics, biochemistry, and cell, developmental, and molecular biology or in departmental-based programs; which include biomedical engineering, nutrition, and public health. The average time to complete our program is 7.7 years. The program usually accepts 8 students each year and currently has a total student body of 61 active students.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid advances in biomedical sciences of the past 30 years has resulted in a critical need for well trained investigators who also have direct involvement with clinical Medicine to translate the multiple new discoveries in biomedical science into workable clinical applications. Joint MD/PhD training of the most outstanding individuals in both modern medicine and the special intellectual perspective and technical know-how of basic biomedical science is a key component of meeting this need.,2019,50258,47913,2345,"Training, Institutional",T32,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,WILLIAM M GEISLER; Talene Alene Yacoubian
5T35HL007473-37,Short Term Training in Health Professional Schools,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this training program is to introduce medical students to the concept of scientific research, the
principles of scientific experimentation, the proper methods of data analysis, and the interpretation,
presentation, and application of research results. This goal will be accomplished by the student working in
the laboratory of a highly skilled investigator who has a proven track record in the mentoring of students in
the research process and who has an actively funded, peer-reviewed, biomedical research program focusing
on cardiovascular, pulmonary or sleep medicine. In addition, all students participate in a series of Career Skills
Workshops. As part of these workshops, students explore career possibilities by meeting with current
translational researchers, as well as UAB SOM leadership. Other sessions focus on how to do a traditional 10-
minute presentation of your research project, how to maintain a laboratory notebook, how to read a scientific
paper, rigor and reproducibility in research, and how to prepare and present a scientific poster. The trainees
also participate in an oral presentation or poster session (Medical Student Research Day) in which their work is
shared and evaluated by faculty and their peers. The top students are selected to attend a national meeting to
present their work. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide trainees with an understanding and
appreciation of the biomedical research process so as to enhance their practice of medicine and to encourage
some members of this select group of students to pursue careers in academic medicine. During the past five
years of grant funding, the program has provided meaningful research experiences for 142 medical students,
plus 83 additional students funded through other mechanisms. During these years, 7% and 30% of trainees
who were appointed to the T35 were underrepresented minorities and women, respectively. These numbers
reflect well the percent of matriculated students (8.5%, and 45%) in the School of Medicine in 2011 â€“ 2016.
Trainees during the current grant period (summers of 2013 â€“ 2016) have published 36 peer-reviewed scientific
papers as a result of their research experience (9 as first author). In the past 15 years of grant funding (years
21-34 of the program), trainees have published 150 peer-reviewed original research articles. Thus over 28%
of all trainees from years 21-34 have been involved in published manuscripts stemming directly from their
training experience. Based upon the successful tracking of the majority of trainees who participated in the
program in years 5-25, we have been able to determine that 23.2% of the medical student trainees are now in
faculty positions at academic medical centers. Those who submitted comments all viewed their research
fellowship as a positive experience and even those who chose a career in private practice view the research as
a valuable component of their training. In summary, the data indicate that this Short Term Research Training
Program has been successful at achieving its goals. Thus, in the present application, we are requesting
funding to continue this training program for another five years.","Project Narrative

1R01DK118932-01A1,Mononuclear phagocytes in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication of medical and surgical diseases that has
significant attributable morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Analysis of outcomes data reported that
patients who develop AKI during a hospitalization are at substantial risk for the development of chronic kidney
disease within 1 year. Mononuclear phagocytes (MP), which consist of macrophages and dendritic cells, have
long been known to exist within the kidney. They are actively involved in maintenance of renal homeostasis
and, more importantly, the restoration of homeostasis after injury. We propose to study the role of MP in AKI
with the guiding hypothesis that the course and outcome of AKI is a function of the involvement of specific
subpopulations of MP, delineated on the basis of their embryonic origin and expression of genes associated
with macrophage function with respect to time post-injury. Intrarenal resident MP are a unique F4/80HiCD11bInt
subpopulation that constitute 50% of renal MP in normal kidneys and are distinct from monocyte derived MP
that arrive from the peripheral circulation. They initially arise from the fetal yolk sac, colonizing the kidney
during embryonic days 8.5-11 in mice and receive little to no further input from the circulation in normal
kidneys. Other subpopulations of renal MP arise from hematopoietic stem cells in the fetal liver and bone
marrow. Very little is known about the role of these F4/80HiCD11bInt resident renal MP in kidney homeostasis
and disease. Our preliminary bulk and single cell RNAseq data, flow cytometry analyses and morphological
studies indicate that resident renal MP follow a developmental program which encompasses a developmental
switch in the resident MP, exemplified by turning on expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class II between 7-21 days after birth. Notably, there is a reversion of resident renal MP to the MHC negative
phenotype shortly after AKI and preliminary RNAseq data indicate that resident renal MP secrete Wnt
glycoproteins, which are known to be intimately involved with kidney embryonic development. These findings
suggest there is at least partial recapitulation of a developmental program after injury, which has been
previously proposed, but never proven. Our central hypothesis is that renal resident MP undergo a
developmental program that is recapitulated, at least in part, following AKI. This developmental program is a
component of the mechanism of recovery from injury and could be involved in a failure to re-establish
homeostasis (i.e. unsuccessful or deranged repair) leading to CKD. To test this hypothesis, we will execute the
following specific aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that renal resident MP are an independent, self-renewing
subpopulation that receives no input from the peripheral circulation after AKI; 2) To test the hypothesis that
renal MP recapitulate a developmental program after AKI; 3) To test the hypothesis that the transition of AKI to
CKD involves a failure of resident MP transcriptional programming to return to the homeostatic state, resulting
in inappropriate expression of nephrogenic and fibrogenic gene products.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major health problem for hospitalized patients, especially those in
intensive care units where mortality among such patients can be as high as 80%. The studies
described in this proposal will investigate the role of renal mononuclear phagocytes, which
have been known to exist within the kidney for nearly 40 years, but have only recently been
determined to play a role in AKI and normal kidney function. We will determine the origin and
function of these cells in the kidney and the roles that they play in the initial injury and the
repair processes after AKI.",2019,456571,307455,149116,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Genetics; Kidney Disease,ANUPAM  AGARWAL; James F George
5K23HD091849-02,Investigating the Impact of Cognition on Capacity in Multiple Sclerosis,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The purpose of this K23 application is to further Dr. Adam Gerstenecker's academic research career in
multiple sclerosis (MS) investigating cognitive impairment, financial and medical decisional capacity, and brain
imaging. The candidate is a neuropsychologist whose long-term career goal is to develop a rehabilitation
program for people who are at particular risk for financial and medical capacity compromise. The study of
financial and medical decision-making capacity appears to have particular relevance in MS. For example,
50%-
75% of people with MS are no longer working a decade after diagnosis; thus, economic hardship and financial
issues become imminent challenges in the lives of those with MS. As a result, budgets must be further
stretched and investment planning retooled and reprioritized. These individuals also confront new questions
regarding medical treatments while choosing among non-curative therapies that are associated with varying
side effects. However, up to 65% of people with MS have cognitive impairment which can negatively affect
their ability to make sound medical decisions. At present, there is only one published study examining capacity
in MS and it has a number of limitations. In regards to neuroimaging, although previous studies have shown
that diffusion imaging (DI) metrics are correlated with cognitive dysfunction in MS, studies examining the
association between DI metrics and financial or medical capacity in MS are not available.
 The objective of this K23 application is to investigate financial and medical capacity in MS and to examine
their clinical and neuroanatomic correlates. This project will provide preliminary data for future intervention
studies in financial and medical capacity that will be the topic of a future R01 grant proposal. The specific
research aims are to: (1) examine differences in financial and medical capacity between MS, TBI, and healthy
controls; (2) examine the neurocognitive, demographic, and disease correlates of capacity in relapsing-
remitting and progressive MS; and (3) establish correlations between DI metrics and capacity in MS. In
addition, a number of mediational and moderational analyses will be conducted. This K23 will provide the
essential training, protected time, and research data to ensure successful transition to independence including:
(1) developing increased knowledge about the course, treatment, and clinical presentation of MS; (2)
developing increased knowledge about legal and ethical issues in decision-making capacity and to gain
increased proficiency in capacity-related grantsmanship; (3) gaining increased knowledge in neuroimaging
procedures and the processing of neuroimaging data; (4) gaining increased knowledge in intervention research
and design, with a focus on the development of tailored cognitive rehabilitation; and (5) receiving increased
training in advanced statistical methods. The mentorship team is led by Dr. Khurram Bashir, an internationally
recognized expert, mentor, and scientist in MS with an outstanding mentoring track record.","Project Narrative
 At a time in which increased cognitive ability is needed to make complex financial and medical decisions,
people with MS are often experiencing cognitive decline; surprisingly though, research into the ability of people
with MS to make complex financial and medical decisions is rare. This study proposes to investigate financial
and medical decisional capacity and its clinical and neuroanatomical correlates in people with relapsing-
remitting MS and progressive MS. The ultimate value of this research will be to act as a necessary first-step in
the development of a targeted capacity rehabilitation program for people diagnosed with MS.",2019,126175,116829,9346,Other Research-Related,K23,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Adam Tyler Gerstenecker

 This Administrative Core section describes how the National Dental PBRN seeks to capitalize on the rare
opportunity provided by the NIDCR to add to the scientific basis of clinical decision-making and move new
evidence into routine clinical practice. It seeks to:
 (1) become the preferred venue where ideas are put to the test under real-world conditions;
 (2) be a resource where clinician ideas can be developed for their impact on patient care.
 (3) conduct studies that make a difference in how care is provided;
 (4) serve as a venue for testing methods for how best to move evidence into routine practice;
 (5) be a network that enhances professional and inter-professional collaborations;
 (6) be a key source for what treatments and methods work, when, and for whom;
 (7) serve as an opportunity for the profession to lead rather than to be led; and
 (8) be a network that patients see as contributing to their well-being and enhancing the public's view of
 dentistry as being committed to research and quality improvement.
 This section of the application describes the rationale for selecting the National Dental PBRN Nodes and
their geographic distribution, by which the National Dental PBRN optimizes many aspects of diversity. The
administrative chain of responsibility in the National Dental PBRN optimizes the decision-making process,
while also enabling consensus building and ongoing Continuous Quality Improvement assessment. This
process is aided by a comprehensive administrative database, which now has more than 13 years of
administrative information and data.
 Administrative activities are conducted both centrally and at the Node level. Node activities are generally
those that involve the most-direct interaction with practitioners, and therefore are likely the most-crucial to
overall network success. Key among those node-level activities are interactions between Node Coordinators
(â€œResearch Assistantsâ€) and practitioners, as the Node Coordinators encourage practitioner enrollment, study
recruitment, study training, study implementation, and practitioner engagement in study results dissemination.

and specialties, practice types, special populations, and patient advocacy groups).
 The National Dental PBRN will accomplish these aims by building upon the many lessons learned from its
highly-productive current national network. We aim to build on our experiences from these past 13 years using
the same funding mechanism and administrative structure mandated in the FOA. The effectiveness of this
structure is evident from our network's high level of productivity, as judged by number of publications and
completed studies, the size, scope, quality, and diversity of studies, and impact on health and daily clinical
practice. The network will comprise six regional nodes, one specialty node, a central administrative core based

5R01HL113614-07,MtDNA repair: An isolated pharmacologic target in acute lung injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction is common in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and its sequel, Multiple
Organ System Failure, but the potential for mt-associated pathways to serve as pharmacologic targets in
ARDS and MOSF has yet to be realized. Among the discoveries originating from this project, two lines of
evidence may have paradigm-shifting implications. First, modulation of mtDNA repair coordinately regulates
oxidative mtDNA damage and attendant cytotoxicity. And second, fragmentation of oxidatively damaged
mtDNA into Damage Associated Molecular Patterns may disseminate injury to distant organs by activating a
regenerative, feed-forward pathway in which mtDNA DAMPs, themselves, damage the mitochondrial genome
and promote more mtDNA DAMP formation. These considerations provide the underpinnings for our long-
term goal to develop pharmacologic strategies to treat ARDS and MOSF based on the concept that
mitochondrial (mt) DNA acts as a molecular sentinel governing disease progression in response to
critical illness or injury. Motivated by our finding that administration of transfusion products inadvertently
containing variable amounts of mtDNA DAMPs increases circulating mtDNA DAMP levels and elevates the risk
of ARDS-like Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury in severely injured patients, Aim 1 will determine if a
feed-forward pathway contributes to mtDNA DAMP accumulation in massively-transfused, critically
injured human subjects at risk for TRALI. Here, we will test the hypothesis that the amount of exogenous
mtDNA administered during massive transfusion dictates the amount of mtDNA DAMPs mobilized from
endogenous, patient-derived sources. The second Aim is predicated on the fact that although oxidative mtDNA
damage leads to DAMP release, only scant information is available concerning mechanisms of mtDNA
fragmentation and sequence characteristics of the DAMPs so formed. Indeed, such deficiencies present
serious obstacles to addressing fundamental questions pertaining to which mtDNA fragments are biologically
active and how they are trafficked in the intra- and extracellular environments. Accordingly, Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that sites of oxidative damage to the mitochondrial genome promote its fracture into
specific mtDNA DAMP sequences and predispose the mt-genome to somatic mutation. Collectively, the
proposed research is significant because it will provide insight into the mechanisms of mtDNA DAMP
formation, the importance of mtDNA DAMPs in the response to injury, and their utility as a pharmacologic
target. It is innovative because the postulated operation of feedforward pathway involving mtDNA damage-
induced DAMP formation is a fundamentally new concept to explain the progressive pathogenesis of ARDS
and MOSF.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Observational studies in severely injured or critically ill human subjects at risk for the acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ system failure (MOSF) show that circulating levels of pro-inflammatory
mitochondrial (mt) DNA fragments, termed mtDNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), are
closely associated with clinical outcomes. Research using animal models suggests that mtDNA DAMPs may,
themselves, trigger a self-propagating cycle leading to more mtDNA DAMP production, which could account for
the relentless progression of ARDS and MOSF despite adequate control of the initial insult. Here, we will test
the hypothesis that such a feed-forward pathway driving mtDNA DAMP production is operative in human
subject and provide the most thorough insight yet available on the mechanisms of formation and fundamental
characteristics of mtDNA DAMPs.",2019,418430,271708,146722,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,366880002,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Clinical Research; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases,MARK N GILLESPIE
1R01GM127823-01A1,mtDNA damage and DAMPs in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome,"Management of severely injured patients is challenging because Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome may
advance relentlessly even if the initial insult is controlled. However, a series of reports point to the prospect
that mitochondrial (mt)-associated pathways play a central role. Specifically, it has been discovered that
oxidative mtDNA damage is both cytotoxic and leads to its fragmentation into proinflammatory mtDNA Damage
Associated Molecular Patterns with the potential to disseminate injury to distant organs. Against this
background, the goal of this project is to provide insight into the origin, characteristics, and biological
effects of mtDNA DAMPs in the setting of trauma-related MODS as a prelude for translating mtDNA-
directed therapies into clinical application. We will use a clinically-relevant porcine model of MODS induced
by hemorrhage with truncal ischemia and reperfusion to address three Aims. Because conventional strategies
for analysis of circulating mtDNA DAMPs use PCR to quantify sequences of about 200 bp in length, it is likely
that the most prevalent or biologically relevant mtDNA DAMP species have not been identified. In addition,
there are tissue-specific differences in mtDNA sequences that may dictate sequence characteristics of
circulating mtDNA DAMPs. Accordingly, Aim 1 will define sequence characteristics of mtDNA DAMPs released
during the evolution of trauma-related MODS and test the hypothesis that unique variant signatures of
circulating mtDNA can be traced to specific organs and that fail. The second aim addresses the origin of
mtDNA fragments accumulating in the circulation after trauma. In this regard, it has been known for decades
that interuption of mesenteric lymphatic drainage forestalls MODS, thus supporting the concept that the liver-
gut-mesenteric axis could be a major source of circulating mtDNA DAMPs, perhaps stimulating mtDNA DAMP
production in other organs. Aim 2 will therefore test the hypotheses that in trauma, mtDNA DAMPs are
present in the mesenteric lymphatic drainage and that an intact mesenteric lymphatic drainage system is
required for systemic mtDNA DAMP accumulation and MODS. Finally, prevention or reversal of mtDNA
damage with novel fusion protein constructs targeting DNA repair enzymes to mitochondria and
pharmacological enhancement of mtDNA DAMP degradation with a repurposed agent, DNase1, forestalls IR
injury in rodents. Importantly, however, neither of these strategies have been explored in a clinically-relevant
animal model. As a consequence, critical mechanistic insight, particularly the purported operation of a feed-
forward pathway linking mtDNA damage to mtDNA DAMP production, is unavailable. Accordingly, to provide
information needed for translation of mtDNA-directed therapies into clinical application, Aim 3 will use test the
hypothesis that mt-targeted Ogg1 and DNase1, given alone or in combination, alter disposition of circulating
mtDNA DAMPs and suppress MODS.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Laboratory experiments in rodent models and observational studies in severely injured human subjects
show that mitochondrial (mt) DNA damage and attendant formation of pro-inflammatory (mtDNA
fragments, termed mtDNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), are closely associated with

their molecular characteristics, and about whether mtDNA damage and DAMP formation are pharmacologic

5R01EY028284-02,Determinants of the Biomechanical Behavior of the Human Lamina Cribrosa,"Project Abstract
Background: Optic nerve head (ONH) biomechanics is thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of
primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). ONH biomechanics is driven be the interactions between intraocular
pressure (IOP), cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) and connective tissue structural stiffness (the combination
of tissue architecture and material properties) in the ONH and sclera. Computational and experimental studies
in animal models have suggested that strain (tissue stretch) in the ONH microenvironment is strongly influenced
by the structural stiffness of the sclera and the morphology and density of the lamina cribrosa (LC). Experimental
studies have shown that these structures also vary with the development of glaucoma, with age and across racial
groups of African descent (AD) vs. European descent (ED) and may also be associated with variation in corneal
thickness and rigidity. This is important since age, glaucoma severity, AD and corneal thickness and rigidity are
the most consistent risk factors for OAG independent of IOP. The Objectives of this study are: 1) to discover
how the morphology of the LC and scleral rigidity determine the mechanical behavior of the ONH in response to
changes in IOP and CSFP and 2) to determine how differences in structural stiffness of the scleral, ONH and
cornea seen in aging, with glaucoma and across racial groups are related to ONH strain. Design: This study will
employ a novel resource, the Alabama Living Eye Project. This program affords access to brain-dead organ
donors prior to organ procurement. Follow discussion and consent with the next-of-kin, an ocular exam with
biometry will be performed, followed by the quantification of in-vivo ONH strain in response to changes in both
IOP and CSFP using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). Following organ procurement,
scleral structural stiffness will be measured with laser electronic speckle pattern interferometry and ONH
microstructure will be quantified in digital 3D histologic episcopic reconstructions of the ONH. Multivariable
models will be used to determine the impact of scleral rigidity and ONH morphology on ONH strain and if these
relationships differ in aged and glaucomatous eyes, in eyes from AD or ED donors and with variations in corneal
stiffness. Impact: This study provides the unique opportunity to link scleral and ONH biomechanics to clinical
ocular imaging and biometrics data, and will elucidate the causative mechanisms related to the variation in ONH
biomechanics seen with age, with glaucoma, across AD and ED groups and associated with measurement of
corneal thickness and rigidity. Not only will this information inform the development of mechanistically relevant
biomarkers for glaucoma susceptibility, understanding how scleral stiffness and ONH morphology modulate ONH
biomechanics will guide the development of new non-IOP lowering glaucoma therapies targeted at altering
strain-driven remodeling of the ONH.

5F30DE027280-02,The Role of Baf45a in Bone Formation,"Bone loss is a worldwide problem resulting in increased risk of fracture and tooth loss27. Osteoblasts are
responsible for bone synthesis; therefore, treatments promoting osteoblast differentiation and/or activity would
result in increased bone formation28. The regulation of DNA accessibility is a key mechanism controlling gene
expression and cellular differentiation. BAF (BRG1 Associated Factor) mediated Chromatin remodeling
increases DNA accessibility by sliding or ejecting nucleosomes1,2,14. This process can occur in a cell type or
stage specific manner based on the composition of the BAF complex4. In many tissue types, a unique
combination of BAF subunits has been identified to be responsible for the maintenance or differentiation of that
cell type4,5,6,7. To date, an osteoblast specific BAF chromatin remodeling complex has yet to be identified. It has
been recently found in our studies that BAF45A, a potential member of the BAF complex, plays an essential
role in osteoblast differentiation and function. The purpose of this study is to address our central hypothesis
that that BAF45A is critical to remodel and activate chromatin at osteoblast specific genes promoting
the synthesis and maintenance of bone. In order to address this hypothesis the study has been divided into
two specific aims. 1) Define the phenotype of BAF45A osteoblast-specific knockout mice: To accomplish
this aim, we have developed an osteoblast-specific knockout of Baf45a. This is done by crossing a Baf45a
floxed allele mouse with an osteoblast specific osteocalcin-Cre mouse. The physical phenotype of this mouse
will be analyzed by whole skeletal staining, microCT, histology/histomorphometry, double calcein labeling, and
a three-point bend test. The molecular properties will be assessed using real time PCR for osteoblastic gene
expression analysis, and chromatin-immunoprecipitation in order to understand the corresponding chromatin
state at osteoblast specific genes. 2) Identify osteoblast differentiation stage-specific BAF complex
composition: To uncover the composition of the osteoblast specific BAF complex, a biotin proximity ligation
technique will be employed. A promiscuous biotin ligase will be linked with BAF45A and proteins in close
proximity will be biotinylated, pulled-down, and identified by mass spectrometry. This will be confirmed by co-
immunoprecipitation. Understanding the physiological role and molecular mechanism of Baf45a as well as the
composition of BAF in osteoblasts will reveal novel insights into osteoblast development and function. This
may ultimately result in the development of treatments targeted to increase osteoblast differentiation and
activity to increase bone mass.","These studies will mechanistically characterize the critical role of BAF mediated chromatin remodeling in

5R01AI134648-03,Defining the biological relevance of HIV-1 adaptation to CD4 T cell responses,"Project Summary
Due to their multiple roles in adaptive immunity, induction of robust CD4 T cells (CD4) is a desirable goal for any
preventative vaccine. Since these cells are the primary targets of HIV infection, their antiviral role in HIV immunity
has been relatively understudied. We have shown immune pressure by effector CD4 drive viral escape, but the
role of these cells and the implications of CD4 immune escape in HIV pathogenesis is unclear. We linked amino
acid changes (termed mutations or adaptations) to specific HLA-II alleles and defined adapted epitopes (AE),
where single amino acid substitutions reflect CD4-mediated immune pressure. The complementary non-
adapted epitope (NAE) shows no evidence of mutation when assessed at a population level. These adaptations
can accrue in a viral population, and the extent of adaptation in a new host is dependent upon their respective
HLA-II alleles. We previously confirmed that AE represent immune escape from CD4 T cells and found the
magnitude and function of AE-specific CD4 T cell responses were diminished, but the impact of CD4-restricted
epitope adaptations on CD4 T cell immunity is unknown. Our overall hypothesis is that CD4 T cells targeting-
NAE have a distinct functional phenotype able to control HIV replication, which is compromised by viral
adaptation to these responses.
Since initiating ART immediately after infection preserves CD4 T cells, this application will address whether early
ART promotes better viral control by allowing CD4 T cells to target NAE, responses known to be beneficial as
compared to AE. We will test this hypothesis using a unique cohort of clade B acutely infected Peruvians where
patients receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) either immediately or 6 months post infection. In specific aim 1, we
will determine the biologic relevance of HIV adaptation to CD4 T cells. To do so, we will determine the ability of
CD4 T cells to inhibit virus that is fully adapted or non-adapted to these responses. We will also assess the
extent to which HLA-II adaptation in the transmitted virus influences clinical disease course in that individual. In
specific aim 2, we will decipher the functional differences (globally and at single cell level) that define an AE or
NAE specific CD4 T cell response and determine whether immediate ART optimizes CD4 T cells by targeting
NAE encoded in the infecting virus. In specific aim 3, we will determine the impact of CD4 T cell adaptation on
vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. We will evaluate the function of CD4 T cells in vaccinees as it relates to
NAE and AE responses. We will also determine whether adaptation of the vaccine insert influences rates of HIV
infection. In summary, CD4 T cell mediated escape implies an in-vivo survival advantage of HIV adaptation and
suggests CD4 T cells are indeed important to immune control of HIV. Elucidating the mechanisms of CD4 T cell
immunity in HIV infection and the relevance of HIV escape to these responses will benefit the design of future
HIV-1 preventative vaccine strategies.","Project Narrative

Developmental Core (Core B)
The mission of the Development Core is to operationalize the Scientific Agenda of the UAB CFAR through
strategic investment, targeted recruitment, and to ensure the development of early investigators in HIV research.
This is accomplished through provision of direct financial support, partnerships with Departmental leaders on
campus, and through directed mentorship and linkage to UAB CFAR services and collaborative investigators for
emerging scientists. The Developmental Core acts as a mentoring and research integration support system
serving UAB investigators engaged in HIV/AIDS research, with a particular emphasis on supporting early stage
and underrepresented minority investigators. Implementation of the UAB CFAR vision has been and remains
key to the dynamic and vibrant research environment that has made it one of the most prolific contributors to
HIV research for almost 30 years. The Developmental Core steers the UAB CFAR in promoting basic,
translational, clinical, and community-engaged research and will continue to do so through 4 aims. The first aim
will mentor early career UAB CFAR faculty members to compete and cope with the rigors of academic research.
The core will provide targeted mentoring to junior faculty via faculty development programs and linkage to
mentors specific to their research area and career ambitions. We will also provide linkage to collaborators with
the UAB HIV Network affiliations and assistance with grant writing and review. Mentorship training is enhanced
via our collaboration with the NIH funded UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science and UABâ€™s Graduate
School. The second aim will administer the highly successful CFAR Developmental Grant Program. As our
investment in young investigators impacts future HIV research efforts at UAB, the program will be aligned with
the NIHâ€™s HIV/AIDS Research initiatives and with an emphasis placed on the career development of young
investigators and underrepresented minority investigators. The third aim will foster a collaborative research
environment through the interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs) and our scientific working group (SWG).
Working on a common topic, via the IRG or SWG mechanism, is an efficient strategy to promote the generation
of new scientific ideas and the development of new areas of collaborative or independent research. We will work
with the IRGs as well as our newly formed Ending HIV in Alabama SWG to identify collaborative opportunities
for senior and junior investigators, and to facilitate mentoring and academic development of young investigators.
The final aim will coordinate UAB CFAR resources in support of recruited investigators who fit the CFAR Strategic
Plan. During this past funding period, we successfully recruited new faculty into the HIV research arena, and
increased the ethnic and gender diversity of our team of investigators. We have intensified our efforts to ensure
that all recruits become successful investigators, and that they are supported by the breadth of CFAR services
available for their research and career development. These aims have been formulated in large part from our
experiences, and we are confident that they will ensure the continuation of UABâ€™s strong HIV research base.",,2019,1223290,823764,399526,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Substance Abuse; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS),Paul A.

1K99DK119413-01,Sex Differences in Renal Sodium Handling,"SUMMARY
This K99/R00 application from Eman Y. Gohar, PhD, is designed to acquire the knowledge and training
necessary to transition into an independently-funded investigator leading a research program focused on sex
differences in cardiovascular and renal physiology. Hypertension and kidney-related diseases are more
common in men and postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women. Renal purinergic signaling
has emerged as an important system in the control of blood pressure and Na+ homeostasis. We have a recent
evidence that estradiol (E2) stimulates Na+ excretion and increases the expression of renal purinergic receptors
(P2Y2&4-R). Importantly, sex differences in the purinergic system has been demonstrated in non-renal tissues,
however sex-related differences in renal purinergic signaling are not clear. The novel estrogen receptor, G
protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), is expressed in the renal medulla. GPER activation elicits
cardiovascular and nephroprotective effects against salt-induced complications. However, its role in Na+
handling is not yet defined. Our preliminary data indicate that activation of GPER in the renal medulla promotes
Na+ excretion via an endothelin-1 (ET-1)-dependent mechanism in female rats. In the current proposal, the
overall hypothesis is that the enhanced renal Na+ handling in females is due, at least in part, to ATP/P2Y2&4-R/
phospholipase C/ epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) and E2/GPER/ET-1/ENaC signaling within the renal medulla.
This hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims. One aim will test whether female rats have enhanced
P2Y2&4-R signaling in the renal medulla compared to males in response to high salt intake. The second aim will
determine whether locally synthetized E2 activates GPER in the renal medulla to promote ET-1-dependent
natriuresis in female rats via inhibition of ENaC. Under the mentorship of Dr. David Pollock and co-mentor, Dr.
Edward Inscho, Dr. Gohar extends her current research on purinergic signaling and rapid estrogen signaling
and proposes additional training that involves three major goals: i) technical development; Dr. Gohar will
develop knowledge and technical expertise in the fields of calcium imaging, RNA sequencing and
bioinformatics, beside refining her surgical skills, ii) professional career development in lab management,
mentoring and grant writing, iii) training in translational research. This 5-year plan will prepare Dr. Gohar for an
R01 submission and set her on a path for a successful independent career.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1F31NS115299-01,Cell-type specific role of the circadian molecular clock in regulating hippocampal physiology and cognition,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the cell-specific expression and role of the molecular clock
within the hippocampus, a brain region critically important for learning and memory and affected by neurological
disorders that also present with circadian rhythm disruptions, e.g. epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases.
Circadian rhythms are biological processes that cycle every 24 hours and are exhibited in many physiological
functions throughout the body. At the cellular level, circadian rhythms are maintained by an oscillating
transcriptional and translational feedback loop of â€˜clockâ€™ genes known as the molecular clock. This molecular
clock is differentially expressed across tissue and cell-types and drives expression of many other genes, giving
rise to the diversity of circadian-influenced physiological processes. Thus, it is important to examine the
molecular clock and its impact on physiology in a tissue and cell-specific manner.
Hippocampal-dependent memory exhibits circadian regulation, with peak performance on memory tasks
occurring at night in nocturnal rodents. The hippocampus expresses core molecular clock components, however,
the cell-specific expression of the molecular clock and its impact on cellular physiology in the hippocampus is
unknown. This is complicated by the complexity of the hippocampal network, composed of heterogeneous
neuronal populations, each with distinct physiological properties and gene expression profiles. This study will
examine the physiological role of the molecular clock in two hippocampal neuron populations: excitatory
pyramidal and parvalbumin-containing (PV) interneurons. First, the endogenous circadian expression of core
clock genes will be measured over 24hrs in these two neuronal populations. Next, the role of the molecular clock
within these two neuronal populations in regulating hippocampal physiology and memory will be assessed. To
do this, the clock will be selectively ablated in either excitatory pyramidal cells or PV-interneurons using Cre/lox
recombination and then neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory will be assessed during the day and night. This proposal utilizes single-molecule in situ hybridization,
whole-cell and extracellular electrophysiology, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory assays to
determine the cell-specific role of the molecular clock in regulating hippocampal physiology and function.
This proposal will generate novel insight into the cell-specific expression and function of the molecular clock in
the hippocampus and has the potential to impact research and disease treatment strategies in the hippocampus.
Given that many neurological diseases have circadian disruptions, understanding molecular and physiological
rhythms across the brain is critically important for human health and disease treatment, as this knowledge can
be used to generate therapeutics targeting circadian disruptions and inform the timing of administration for
existing therapeutics.","Project Narrative

3R01MD010441-03S1,Racial and Socioeconomic Differences in Chronic Low Back Pain,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain affects more than 100 million people in the United States and produces annual costs up to $635
billion. While pain affects all segments of the population, the burden of chronic pain and associated disability
disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Blacks (â€œBlacksâ€) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (â€œWhitesâ€) as well
as individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) compared to those with high SES. Blacks often experience
more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to Whites. Further, SES factors, such as lower
levels of education, low income, and unemployment are associated with higher rates of chronic and disabling
pain. Despite growing documentation of racial differences in chronic pain outcomes, relatively little research
has focused on differences in the experience of chronic low back pain (cLBP) between Blacks and Whites in a
socioeconomic context. This is concerning because cLBP is one of the most prevalent and severely disabling
painful conditions, yet it remains unclear whether specific disadvantaged subgroups of society such as Blacks
with low SES may be at heightened risk for poor cLBP outcomes. The proposed hypotheses are based on the
theory of fundamental causes as a socioeconomic framework for explaining why cLBP severity and disability,
as well as the factors predicting these outcomes, may differ as a function of racial background. Guided by the
theory of fundamental causes, the overall aim of this study is to characterize racial and SES differences in
cLBP severity and disability. Further, we aim to examine important biopsychosocial predictors of racial and
SES differences in cLBP outcomes. To explore this overall aim, we will first characterize racial and SES
differences in cLBP clinical symptoms, perceived disability, and functional performance. Next, we will invoke
endogenous pain inhibitory and facilitatory processes using quantitative sensory tests of conditioned pain
modulation and temporal summation, respectively. Biologically-driven factors including sleep, vitamin D,
oxytocin, and C-reactive protein, in addition to psychosocial factors including depressive symptoms, racial
discrimination, perceived injustice, access to social support, and psychological resilience will then be
assessed. We will determine whether endogenous pain modulatory processes, as well as important
biopsychosocial factors differentially predict cLBP outcomes for Blacks and Whites, and whether the strength
of prediction varies according to SES. This study will be the first to directly and comprehensively apply a
socioeconomic framework to the study of racial differences in cLBP outcomes. The findings will also provide
novel and important information regarding biopsychosocial predictors of racial and SES differences in clinical
pain responses and related disability among those with cLBP. Whether these biopsychosocial predictors may
subsequently serve as viable treatment targets for cLBP tailored to meet the specific needs of disadvantaged
population subgroups can then be addressed in future research.","Project Narrative

1R01HL147603-01,"The Impact of Insomnia on Pain, Physical Function, and Inflammation in HIV","Project Summary/Abstract
Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both, despite adequate
opportunity for sleep attainment. As a result, people with insomnia may get too little sleep and/or have poor sleep
quality. Insomnia is a common and debilitating sleep disorder in persons living with HIV (PLWH), with prevalence
estimates ranging from 30-73%. Insomnia is increasingly viewed as a risk factor for the onset and/or worsening
of pain symptoms and physical functioning deficits. Insomnia has been found to promote enhanced pain
sensitivity (also known as hyperalgesia), which is critical to the etiology of pain in everyday life. This is particularly
relevant for PLWH because recent evidence attests to the fact that pain symptoms are quite prevalent in the
daily lives of PLWH. Whether insomnia is a risk factor for the experience of pain and poor physical functioning
in PLWH is a topic that has received minimal attention to date; therefore, additional research is needed.
Inflammatory processes represent an important biologic mechanism linking insomnia to pain and physical
function. Insomnia promotes systemic inflammation as well as inflammatory reactivity to physical stressors like
pain. Research conducted with non-HIV samples has shown that inflammation can substantially increase
sensitivity to painful stimuli in the laboratory setting, as well as exacerbate pain symptoms in everyday life and
physical disability. Taken together, insomnia may drive pain and physical function in PLWH through the
proliferation of inflammatory mediators. There is currently a need to elucidate mechanisms and mediators of
sleep disorders in PLWH, and the consequences and influences of these disturbances on other HIV-related
comorbidities. Accordingly, the overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of insomnia on pain,
physical function, and inflammation in PLWH. We will accomplish our overall objective by addressing the
following specific aims: 1) determine whether insomnia promotes increased experimental pain sensitivity and
exaggerated inflammatory reactivity to painful stimuli in PLWH, and 2) determine if fluctuations in insomnia
burden over time drive inflammation and pain in everyday life, and physical functioning among PLWH. These
aims will be addressed using study methods developed and rigorously refined by our research team, and which
have previously yielded promising preliminary results suggesting that insomnia may indeed promote pain and
inflammation in PLWH. This approach is innovative because the impact of insomnia on pain and pain-related
inflammatory processes has never before been directly examined in PLWH. Furthermore, the incorporation of
objective as well as subjective measures of sleep and physical function, experimental pain testing, and a wide
array of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers also contributes to the innovation of this proposal. The proposed
research will be significant because, if our hypotheses are confirmed, we will identify: 1) insomnia as a major
driver of pain and physical functioning in the laboratory and in everyday life among PLWH, and 2) inflammation
as an important insomnia-related mediator of pain in PLWH.","Project Narrative
Due to its prevalence and impact on quality of life and overall health, the Centers for Disease

1R21EY031103-01,Development and Validation of a Tree Shrew  Model of Diabetic Retinopathy,"People with diabetes are 25 times more likely to become blind than non-diabetics developing diabetic retinopathy
(DR). Two major cellular events, neurodegeneration and retinal vasculature dysfunction, are known
pathophysiological biomarkers of DR. Currently, research on retinal dysfunction, including reduced cone
sensitivity, delayed activation of the cone phototransduction cascade, selective loss of S cones, glial
abnormalities, and the thinning of both the nerve fiber layer and the retinal ganglion cell layer, in patients with
DR has been delayed due to the lack or inaccessibility of an appropriate animal model. Several animal models of
DR have been used to study the cellular and molecular basis of DR pathogenesis. While these models have
recently demonstrated that hyperglycemia is sufficient to injure neurons, it is not yet clearly understood how
cone photoreceptor cells deteriorate with compromised insulin tolerance. The latter is particularly important,
given that these animal models have rod-dominant retinas. In contrast, northern tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri )
are one of the closest living relatives to primates, and they have a cone-dominant retina with a â€œfovea-likeâ€
cone density in the central region. Therefore, we hypothesize that tree shrews are an ideal and unique
model of DR that accurately emulate critical aspects of human DR and will further translational research
aimed at restoring vision in diabetic patients. This model would also bridge research conducted with NHP and
rodents, allowing for critical data interpretation of potential DR biomarkers. First, we will verify
whether hyperglycemia is associated with cone photoreceptor dysfunction and cell loss. Second, we will
validate whether the retina of diabetic tree shrews experiences a metabolic equilibrium disturbance during
retinopathy progression like other human diabetic tissues. Finally, we will investigate whether compromised
permeability, pericyte loss, and formation of acellular capillaries lead to vascular histopathology in diabetic
tree shrews. By generating and delineating a new non-primate model of DR with the most striking and most
novel phenotypes, such as cone photoreceptor dysfunction, retinal metabolic failure, and vascular
abnormalities, we can lay the groundwork for a better molecular understanding of DR pathophysiology and
open an avenue for improving the treatment of human eye diseases.","We propose to develop and validate a tree shrew model of diabetic retinopathy that accurately mimics neuro-

5R01EY027763-02,Molecular mechanisms of translational control in mice with inherited retinal degeneration,"Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) diseases are a clinically and genetically diverse group of retinal
dystrophies including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP).
Despite significant progress in the basic science and clinical aspects of many retinopathies, the cellular
mechanisms responsible for inherited vision loss require further investigation, and effective therapies are still
under development. Therefore, we focused on the elucidation of the IRD mechanism and the development of
therapeutic strategies. In particular, we address the role of translational attenuation in retinal pathogenesis of
mice-mimicking human ADRP and LCA and propose therapeutic approaches based on the restoration of protein
synthesis in affected photoreceptors. The proposal is supported by strong scientific premises created by our
published and preliminary data, as well as the works of others. They suggest that mice with IRD experience
persistent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and translational attenuation in the retinas. In
addition, our preliminary data demonstrate that PERK (protein kinase R [PKR]-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase)
UPR arm is responsible for the sustained translational suppression in stressed photoreceptors. To support this,
we will investigate three PERK-induced targets that independently regulate the consensual work of translational
machinery. First, we plan to evaluate the impact of translational attenuation on retinal degeneration provided by
phosphorylated eIF2a, a major hallmark of translational block. Second, we plan to assess the role of TRB3 in
retinal degeneration by modifying its expression, thereby testing the hypothesis that TRB3 increase during IRD
progression is cytotoxic, while its down-regulation enhances protein synthesis and retards IRD progression.
Finally, we plan to test the hypothesis that stabilization of the 5'cap mRNA recognition complex by deactivation
of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (4E-BP), a negative translational regulator slows the onset of IRD through
augmentation of protein synthesis. Genetically modified mice expressing altered levels of UPR and mRNA
translation-associated markers; mice-modeling human IRD; pharmacological approaches altering levels of UPR
markers; and adeno-associated viral gene delivery will be used in the study to regulate protein synthesis and
explore therapeutic approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of translational
regulation in healthy and diseased photoreceptors. If successful, this study will not only enhance our
molecular understanding of how degenerating PRs die but also create a platform for therapeutic intervention
to halt IRD progression in humans. PERK pathway-targeted therapies could be used as a mutation-
independent treatment for retinas experiencing chronic ER stress or as a supplemental strategy to
enhance pre-existing gene replacement approaches. They would be particularly attractive for mutations in
large genes that cannot be treated using conventional AAV-mediated gene therapy.","This project will explore the contribution of three molecular targets in mice mimicking human inherited retinal
degeneration and experiencing chronic unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. The three UPR-induced
targets independently regulating different steps of translation machinery in the retina will be validated for
therapeutic potential to restore protein synthesis and halt retinal degeneration. The present study will use
genetically modified animal models, a pharmacological approach modulating expression of UPR markers, and

retinas.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,Marina  Gorbatyuk

5R01DK116726-02,Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes,"The decline in first-phase insulin secretion is a key event in the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the cause of beta-cell failure is not clear, â€œlipotoxicityâ€ has been proposed. Bariatric surgery and very-low calorie diets in patients with T2D induce disease remission, characterized by a return of first-phase insulin secretion and a depletion of pancreas lipid. However, these are extreme approaches to treating T2D, and non-invasive, sustainable, yet equally effective, treatments are needed. We have shown in individuals at risk for T2D that an intervention with a weight-maintaining low-glycemic (LG) diet selectively depletes visceral adipose tissue and ectopic lipid in muscle while preserving thigh subcutaneous adipose and lean body mass. This observation suggests that such diets are able to â€œremodelâ€ body composition by re-partitioning energy away from metabolically harmful lipid stores. Participants on the LG diet also demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity and a dramatic (9-fold) increase in first-phase insulin secretion. Thus, we hypothesize that a weight-maintaining LG diet will selectively deplete ectopic adipose tissue, including pancreatic lipid, and will permit recovery of beta-cell function in individuals with T2D. Rescue of beta-cell function may be particularly important in African-Americans (AA), who as a group demonstrate a high prevalence of T2D, for reasons that cannot be explained by lifestyle. AA are likely to be vulnerable to beta-cell failure due to inherently high beta-cell responsiveness (demonstrable in healthy young children). Further, it has been shown that pancreas lipid is a determinant of prediabetes specifically in AA. Thus, we hypothesize that an LG diet will be particularly beneficial to beta-cell function and glycemic control among AA. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the impact a weight-maintaining LG diet vs a Control diet (ADA/USDA) with all food provided on changes in pancreatic lipid by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and first-phase insulin secretion by hyperglycemic clamp and oral meal test in AA and European-American (EA) individuals with early T2D (<5 yr since diagnosis). The study will be powered to examine race-specific effects (race x diet interaction). This proposal responds to PA-17-021, â€œAddressing Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases.â€ The results from this study could change clinical care guidelines to incorporate an LG diet, which may reduce the disproportionate burden of T2D and its complications experienced by AA.","Type 2 diabetes develops because the pancreas is no longer able to secrete enough insulin to control blood sugar. Patients with type 2 diabetes have more fat in their pancreas than healthy individuals, and if pancreas fat is reduced, insulin secretion returns. In this study, we will determine if a low sugar diet can reduce pancreas fat and improve insulin secretion and glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.",2019,532756,358758,173998,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention,W Timothy GARVEY; BARBARA A GOWER
5R01DK115483-02,Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction,"Summary
 African-American (AA) women are disproportionately burdened by obesity. Our published data have
led to the provocative hypothesis that this disparity has physiologic underpinnings. Specifically, AA women are
characterized by a high acute insulin secretory response to a glucose challenge, as well as reduced hepatic
insulin extraction, which together lead to postprandial circulating insulin concentrations that can be several fold
higher than those observed in Caucasian (European-American, EA) women. The lipogenic actions of insulin
could favor partitioning of energy to adipose tissue at the expense of ATP (energy) production. In fact, AA
women have lower energy requirements than EA women, and are more energetically efficient. High insulin
secretion, however, is only one factor that determines insulin action; another major factor is insulin sensitivity.
Our data have shown that over time, weight (fat) gain in obesity-prone AA women is higher in those who are
more insulin sensitive, whereas â€œobesity-resistantâ€ (constitutionally lean) AA women have relatively lower
insulin sensitivity. Our data also suggest that the lipogenic actions of insulin in AA women are exacerbated by
a high-glycemic diet, which promotes insulin secretion. Finally, our data have shown that over time weight (fat)
gain in AA women is predicted by the combination of insulin sensitivity and dietary glycemic load. Taken
together, these observations suggest that many AA women are predisposed to obesity by their
endocrine make-up, and that this predisposition is exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet. A natural
corollary of this hypothesis is that for implementation of intentional weight loss, a low- (vs high-) glycemic diet
will promote greater loss of body fat, and will enable successful weight loss maintenance by increasing energy
expenditure. This corollary is supported by our preliminary data that indicate a 50% greater loss of fat with
low- vs high-glycemic diet under controlled conditions in AA women. The project proposed herein will test
these hypotheses through a randomized clinical weight loss trial of high- vs low-glycemic diets in obese AA
women. The study has both an efficacy phase (controlled feeding during weight loss) to probe physiologic
mechanisms (energy expenditure, metabolic efficiency), and an effectiveness phase (6-month free-living
follow-up) to test the hypothesis that the low-glycemic diet will be more effective at promoting weight loss
maintenance due in part to improved adherence and quality of life, and ease of implementing the diet. This
study is innovative in that it proposes to test a specific physiologic mechanism that may underlie propensity to
obesity; it includes both efficacy and effectiveness outcomes; it involves both quantitative and qualitative
methodology; and it tackles optimization of both weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This study is
intended to provide the evidence base necessary to improve the clinical care approach to weight loss.","Using a randomized clinical trial intervention study design, we will test the hypothesis that the metabolic
phenotype of obese African-American women predisposes them to obesity when they eat a specific type of
diet. We predict that women who consume a low glycemic diet will lose more weight and be more successful
with maintaining weight loss than women who consome a high glycemic diet, due in part to higher resting and
total metabolic rate and lower metabolic efficiency. Results from this study will verify that the high obesity
prevalence in African-American women is due to their unique physiology, and will offer a dietary means for
preventing and/or reversing obesity not only in this group, but in any individual with similar endocrine
characteristics.",2019,655991,441745,214246,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention,BARBARA A GOWER
7IK2RX002781-02,Mechanisms and treatments of mitochondrial dysfunction in paralyzed skeletal muscle after spinal cord injury,"Unloading and paralysis of skeletal muscle after spinal cord injury (SCI) results in severe loss of muscle
contractile function and deleterious alterations in mitochondrial morphology and performance. One potential
mechanism is the de novo appearance of connexin hemichannels (Cx) in paralyzed muscle. We hypothesize
Cx destabilize mitochondrial function in paralyzed muscle. Cx43 and 45 appear in the sarcolemma de novo
after paralysis and are believed to contribute to muscle atrophy by permitting entry of extracellular calcium
(Ca2+) into the muscle fiber. We posit that the systematic study of the role of Cx43 and 45 after SCI using
transgenic mouse models will evaluate the potential of blockers of Cx for future drug development.
 We also propose that protecting mitochondrial function and morphology by a pharmaceutical
intervention may be beneficial for muscle health after SCI. SS-31 is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant that
has reduced muscle loss and protected mitochondrial function in mouse models of muscle wasting. No study
has tested whether SS-31 improves muscle health after paralysis.
 Our overall objective is to find interventions and treatments to increase the well-being of individuals with
SCI. We hypothesize that muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 will protect muscle health after SCI.
Additional studies will describe the role of drug or diet interventions in protecting muscle function after
paralysis. We believe data from this line of studies will provide insight into multiple novel treatments that
protect muscle health after SCI and provide a path to translatable medicine and future clinical investigations.
1. Specific Aim 1 (Year 1-[3]): Determine whether a muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 protects
mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function in mice paralyzed by SCI
Hypothesis: Muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 will slow the loss of muscle mass and function and
protect against the degradation of mitochondrial morphology after contusion SCI.
Approach: 4-month old transgenic mice carrying a muscle-specific MyoD-driven Cre-recombinase and floxed
Cx43 and 45 will be given a sham or contusion SCI and be compared to a MyoD-Cre-recombinase-only
genotype control. Behavioral tests, muscles function tests and biochemical outcomes will be analyzed.
2. Specific Aim 2 (Year [4-5]): Investigate the efficacy of an SS-31 drug intervention for preserving
muscle function and mitochondrial morphology and limiting ROS production after SCI.
Hypothesis: Daily injections of SS-31 will protect muscle and mitochondrial morphology after contusion SCI.
Approach: 4-month old wild type C57BL/6 female mice will be given a sham or SCI as well as daily injections of
SS-31 or vehicle across time. Muscle function will be measured ex vivo; ROS production rate will be measured
from isolated muscle mitochondria and whole muscle lysates.","Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects approximately 40,000 Veterans and leads to healthcare costs of $525,000 for
the first year after SCI and $80,000 each year thereafter. This provides a strong justification to find treatments
which help reduce the financial burden facing Veterans with SCI while also increasing their well-being. Skeletal
muscle function and health are severely reduced after SCI and this is associated with negative health factors
such as insulin resistance, inflammation and obesity. Protecting mitochondrial health after paralysis may be a
way to preserve muscle health after SCI. There are no FDA-approved treatments to preserve mitochondrial
health. Investigating whether the appearance of connexin hemichannels in muscle after SCI is linked to
mitochondrial health may provide an avenue for future drug design. Testing current drugs for improving
mitochondrial health, such as SS-31, can provide essential information regarding how best to improve the
health of Veterans with SCI.",2019,,,,Other,IK2,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,Zachary Aaron Graham
5R01EY028858-02,ACE2 Modulates the Bone Marrow- Gut Axis in Diabetic Retinopathy,"This proposal examines the hypothesis that diabetes results in a pathological change in the
communication between the bone marrow (BM) and gut leading to dysfunction in both
compartments. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II (ANG II) to
angiotensin 1-7(Ang 1-7) which, by virtue of its actions on the Mas receptor, opposes the
molecular and cellular effects of ANG II. In human subjects with diabetes, sustained activation
of the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis in a key BM population (CD34+ cells) was associated with
protection from development of diabetic retinopathy. Ace2/Ace1 mRNA ratio was reduced in
small intestine epithelial cells (IEC) and in BM cells of diabetic mice and these changes are
associated with both gut and BM pathology. Microbiota studies comparing Akita mice and Ace2-
/- Akita mice demonstrate that the loss of ACE2 results in significant phylogenetic differences
and these changes are associated with increased infiltration of proinflammatory BM cells into
the gut.
 These novel findings have led us to propose the following hypothesis: Dysregulated RAS
resulting in reduced ACE2 in BM and gut drives the disturbed BM-gut axis in diabetes.
Increasing ACE2 expression in BM or IEC, either by genetic or pharmacological
manipulations, will restore reciprocal communication between BM and gut preventing
development of diabetic retinopathy.
 Aim 1: In Akita mice, to determine whether increasing ACE2 expression in hematopoietic
cells will facilitate maintenance of endothelial and epithelial barrier functions in retina and gut.
Hematopoietic-specific Ace2 transgenic mice (Vav1-CreAce2KI) will be crossed with Akita mice
to generate Vav1-CreAce2KI.Akita mice (Model 1). Vav1-CreAce2KI will provide donor BM for
BM transplantation into Akita mice (Model 2).
 Aim 2: To determine whether sustained ACE2 expression in hematopoietic cells will prevent
diabetes-induced dysbiosis and development of DR.
 Aim 3. To determine whether correction of dysbiosis by exogenous administration of
genetically modified probiotics expressing ACE2 or overexpression of ACE2 in intestinal
epithelial cells of the gut will protect from development of DR.","Diabetic retinopathy is the most common of all diabetic microvascular complications. In this
application, we will examine how the communication between the bone marrow (BM) and the
gut influences the development of diabetic retinopathy. We will overexpress a key enzyme,
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in BM cells or in intestinal epithelial cells or by
probiotics and determine if we can improve the interactions between the BM and gut and
prevent development of diabetic retinopathy.",2019,403279,321136,82143,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Microbiome,Michael Edwin Boulton; Maria Bartolomeo Grant; Qiuhong  Li
5R01EY028037-03,Somatostatin blockade of CNS autonomic hyperactivity for treatment of diabetic retinopathy,"We have shown that loss of somatostatin (SST) expression in the hypothalamus is
associated with chronic excitatory activation of brainstem sympathetic autonomic effector
neurons in diabetes. We have evidence that periventricular hypothalamic SST neurons (i.e.
those that innervate brainstem sympathetics) directly innervate bone marrow (BM) and that
preservation of this small, but important population appears to be particularly relevant to prevent
sympathetic hyperactivity. Sympathetic hyperactivity leads to BM dysfunction with an increase in
the generation and release of proinflammatory monocytes that contribute to the development of
diabetic retinopathy (DR). Systemic monocytosis resulting from BM dysfunction also serves to
promote neuroinflammation of the hypothalamus and of brainstem sympathetic autonomic
effector neurons resulting in an auto-perpetuating cycle of excitation of autonomic neurons.
 The central hypothesis emerging from these studies is that restoring SST levels and
neuronal activity in the diabetic hypothalamus to nondiabetic levels will reduce chronic
excitatory activation of brainstem sympathetic autonomic effector neurons, avoid
development of BM pathology and the subsequent systemic and retinal inflammation
leading to DR.
 In Aim 1, we will determine whether loss of SST neuronal activity results in persistent
hypothalamic hyper excitation of brainstem autonomic effector nuclei and chronic over activation
of the BM leading to BM pathology. In Aim 2, we will determine whether restoration of SST
levels using vector expressing SST in hypothalamic neurons of diabetic rodents will reduce
chronic over activation of sympathetic neuronal activity to the BM, prevent/reverse BM
dysfunction and prevent/treat DR. In Aim 3, we will test whether long-term pharmacological
supplementation using intranasal delivery of the somatostatin analogue, octreotide, would
prevent diabetes-induced BM dysfunction and DR, and block hypothalamic inflammation to stop
the auto-perpetuating cycle of excitation of autonomic neurons. SST analogues have been
tested extensively in humans and this strategy could be immediately translated to clinical use by
adopting intranasal administration of SST analogues to reduce diabetes-induced sympathetic
hyperactivity responsible for BM pathology, systemic inflammation and DR.","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes. Our proposal will
examine an entirely novel mechanism for the development of DR: Autonomic nervous system (ANS)
hyperactivity that impairs bone marrow function leading to generation of increased numbers of tissue infiltrating
monocytes. We propose to target ANS brain regions, specifically the hypothalamus with a virus expressing
somatostatin or with a somatostatin analogue that blocks ANS hyperactivity and downstream events to
prevent/treat DR.",2019,471105,368117,102988,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Prevention,Michael Edwin Boulton; CHARLES J FRAZIER; Maria Bartolomeo Grant
5R01EY012601-20,Human IPSC for Repair of Vasodegenerative Vessels in Diabetic Retinopathy,"Vascular complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM) are the result of sustained vascular
injury with insufficient vascular repair. In chronic diabetes, vascular reparative mechanism can
be lost resulting in development of microvascular complications (MVC), such as diabetic
retinopathy (DR). We assessed the reparative function of progenitor cells that circulate in the
peripheral blood of diabetic individuals and found that the vascular wall-derived progenitor cells,
endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), were depleted in diabetics with MVC. Bone marrow-
derived progenitor cells, CD45+CD34+ were dysfunctional in diabetics with MVC. We found that
human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived ECFCs displayed the ability to form
functional and durable blood vessels in vivo and conferred therapeutic revascularization by
connecting with and remaining integrated with host rodent vessels long term. We characterized
a mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+ cells) generated from hiPSCs that gives rise to ECFCs.
Finally, we used hiPSCs to generate CD34+CD45+ cells and tested the impact of co-
administration of these cells with ECFCs within the vitreous. The addition of CD34+CD45+ cells
with ECFCs resulted in the enhanced survival, function and reparative ability of the ECFCs. This
beneficial effect was mediated by reducing retinal oxidative stress and inflammation.
 These novel and paradigm shifting findings led us to hypothesize: the hiPSC-derived-
mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+) can be utilized for long term revascularization of
vasodegenerative capillaries and their reparative action can be further enhanced by coinjection
of CD34+CD45+ cells that provide anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
 Three aims will test this hypothesis: Aim1: To determine whether hiPSC-derived SSEA5-
KNA+ cells generated from either healthy donors or diabetic donors can give rise to ECFCs and
pericytes to repair retinal vessels in mouse models of DR. Aim 2: To generate CD34+CD45+
cells from diabetic or control iPSCs and examine whether they enhance the function of SSEA5-
KNA+ cells when co-injected into mouse models of DR. Aim 3: Our hypothesis predicts that
hiPSC-derived SSEA5-KNA+ cells and CD34+CD45+ cells in combination can optimally support
vascular repair in a Western diet-induced type 2 diabetic primate model of DR. The outcome of
this work will provide a paradigm-changing approach for autologous cell therapy by optimizing
the use of hiPSC-derived cells to enable highly efficient production of vascular cells for
tissue/organ-based vascular repair.","This application proposes to carefully examine the hypothesis that human inducible
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be effectively employed as a future therapeutic option for
individuals with diabetic retinopathy and macular ischemia. iPSCs will be used to generate
mesoderm cells for injection into the vitreous cavity of diabetic rodent and primate eyes in order
to examine the ability of these cells to generate endothelial cells and pericytes in areas of
degenerated capillaries. iPSCs can also be manipulated to generate hematopoietic
CD34+CD45+ cells, which will allow the examination of these cells for their ability to enhance the
vessel forming function of the mesoderm cells.",2019,552358,429440,122918,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human,Michael Edwin Boulton; Maria Bartolomeo Grant; Mervin C.

5R35GM124590-03,Bacterial responses to reactive chlorine stress and their role in host-microbe interactions,"Project Summary/Abstract
The interface between bacteria and the immune system is absolutely fundamental to human health, and the
long-term goal of my work is to understand how that interface is regulated. Colonization of the gut by both
pathogenic and commensal bacteria has major effects on human health. Gut microbial communities are
strongly affected by the redox environment of the intestine and by oxidants produced by the innate immune
system during inflammation. These include both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive chlorine species
(RCS). RCS, including hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and reactive chloramines, are powerful antimicrobial
oxidants capable of damaging many cellular components, including proteins, lipids, cofactors, and DNA. HOCl
is a very common disinfectant in medical, industrial, and home settings, but RCS are also a natural part of the
antimicrobial arsenal of neutrophils, accumulate during inflammation, and appear to be important for controlling
bacterial colonization of mucosal epithelia, such as those in the gut. Little is known about how the bacteria
which make up the human microbiome sense or respond to RCS, and this response is expected to be critical
for the ability of bacteria to survive interactions with the human immune system. The research proposed in this
application will use transcriptomic, genetic, biochemical, and systems biology techniques to identify and
characterize the genes, proteins, and pathways which bacteria use to sense and respond to RCS, and will use
mammalian cell culture and animal studies to test the roles of these mechanisms in host-microbe interactions.
Our short- to medium-term goals focus on the gut microbes Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus reuteri. E. coli is
physiologically very well characterized, easy to manipulate, and pro-inflammatory, while L. reuteri is anti-
inflammatory and associated with a healthy microbiome. We will identify and characterize RCS-sensing
regulators in these organisms and characterize the molecular mechanisms by which those regulators and the
genes they control protect the bacteria against RCS-mediated damage and influence interactions between
bacteria and their mammalian hosts. In the longer-term, these studies will be expanded to other model
bacteria in order to characterize RCS responses across the diversity of the microbiome. The ultimate goal of
this research is to understand RCS stress responses in medically important bacteria, particularly focusing on
the roles they play in colonization and pathogenesis. The results of this research program will advance the
field of oxidative stress response, elucidate the basis for the in vivo specificity of RCS-sensing transcription
factors, help understand the underlying causes of RCS toxicity, and may lead to identification of novel
mechanisms of interaction between bacteria and the innate immune system. This could potentially lead to new
microbe-targeted treatments for the growing list of inflammatory diseases known to be influenced by the
microbiome, and may have broad implications for our understanding of host-microbe interactions,
pathogenesis, colonization, and RCS tolerance in a wide variety of organisms.","Project Narrative

5R01NS089750-05,Exploring the contribution of astrocytes to Huntington disease,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an adult-onset autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by cognitive, psychiatric and motor deficits which progress to severe disability and death. To date there are no affective treatments for HD. The mutated huntingtin (mHTT) protein is widely expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, yet neurodegeneration critically affects a few subsets of neuronal cell types in the brain. Understanding the toxicity produced by mhtt in non-neuronal cell types and the basis for this selective neurodegeneration are likely to be critical in the desin of effective therapies for the disease.  The goal of this proposal is to expand our knowledge of the contribution of full length-mHTT (fl-mHTT) expressing astrocytes to neurodegeneration in HD. Astrocytes are critical to the proper function and development of the nervous system. They are involved in modulating synaptic activity and neurotransmission. Studies from our laboratory have uncovered increased SNARE-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes in culture taken from the conditional fl-mHTT expressing BACHD mouse model. This is a new found disruption caused by fl-mHTT expression in the astrocytes, which further implicates these cells in HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reducing fl-mHTT expression in astrocytes in vivo, contributes to the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes observed in the conditional BACHD mouse model. The studies proposed here will further our understanding of astrocyte contribution to HD and determine if targeting this cell type for therapeutic intervention is worthwhile. We will use conditional genetic mouse models in these studies and propose three aims: 1) To determine if fl-mHTT expressing astrocytes contribute to HD pathogenesis by increasing glutamate levels in BACHD mice through exocytosis of glutamate; 2) To determine if expression of mutant huntingtin in astrocytes contributes to the abnormal medium spiny neuron physiology observed in BACHD mice; and 3) To determine if decreasing fl-mHTT expression in astrocytes after disease onset in BACHD mice is sufficient to alleviate HD symptoms and whether astrocyte specific expression in a new mouse model is sufficient to cause HD-like phenotypes in mice. Together these studies will help to define the role of fl-mHTT within astrocytes in HD pathogenesis, and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of HD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating progressive adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there is no treatment or a cure for HD. HD is one of the most common familial neurodegenerative disorders, with 30,000 clinically diagnosed HD patients and another 150,000-200,000 at risk for HD in the US.",2019,387497,267060,120437,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Disorders; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,Michelle  Gray
5IK2RX001866-04,"A Minimally Invasive Platform to Target, Image, and Treat Head and Neck Cancer","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
This proposal combines fluorescent imaging, active targeting, and subsequent photothermal treatment of malignant cells as an approach for treating head and neck cancers. The use of a near-infrared (NIR) laser enables us to take advantage of both the plasmon resonance absorption peak of gold nanorods (AuNRs), ~785 nm, as well as the absorption peak of the fluorescent dye, ~774 nm. We propose to label anti-EGFR antibodies, which target the over-expressed EGFR on malignant cells, with a fluorescent dye and conjugate them to AuNRs. This active targeting is expected to prove more efficient than previously reported approaches that relied solely on enhanced permeability and retention effects. Our preliminary results suggest that NIR photothermal treatment heated the AuNRs, excited fluorescence, killed approximately 90% of tumor cells in vitro, and provided a 40% reduction in tumor volume in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a minimally invasive modality to combine tumor targeting and fluorescent imaging with a method to induce tumor regression in live mice. We aim to demonstrate that this multifunctional platform to target, image, and treat tumors is an improvement over current treatment regimens for Veterans suffering with head and neck cancer.   
   
","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   
A cheaper, faster, and more specific cancer treatment would save the Veterans Administration (VA) money, time, and lives. Improvement is needed, especially for patients with regionally advanced, recurrent, chemo-resistant, or stage IV cancer and during palliative care. Targeted specificity of antibody-based therapies, combined with fluorescent imaging and the tumor regression induced by photo-thermal therapy, could improve side effects and tumor cell kill rates. This proposal investigates how fluorescently-labeled antibodies improve imaging and the targeted delivery of laser-activated nanoparticles and how these nanoparticles enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the antibody therapy. This represents a new class of adjuvant therapies. The broader impact may include shorter treatment times, cheaper costs, and decreased side effects, leading to improved patient prognosis, quality of life, and life span for Veterans.

5R01AI116738-05,Transcription and replication in nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs) include measles, influenza A, Ebola and many other causative agents of serious human disease. In order to gain a better understanding of the replication cycle of this class of viruses, we are studying the molecular structure of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a prototypic non-segmented NSV (NNSV) in the rhabdovirus family. VSV and the other NNSV encode a functionally conserved set of proteins (N, P, and L) that serve to duplicate their genomes and produce functional viral mRNAs. The processes of transcription and replication require two viral components, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, a complex between L and P) and the genomic template. For NSVs, the active template for both of these processes is the nucleocapsid (N+RNA), not the naked RNA alone. Our previous structural studies showed how the RNA is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid and how the RNA adopts a unique structure once within the capsid. The RdRp must gain access to the bases of the sequestered RNA in order to initiate polynucleotide synthesis. Since the nucleocapsid is the template for viral RNA synthesis and given the intimate association between N and the RNA, questions arise as to what role the N protein may play in transcription and replication. The new studies proposed here are focused on: Aim 1, the structural requirement of the functional template in initiation of viral transcriptin and replication. We have developed methods to solve the structure of specific RNA sequences encapsidated within nucleocapsid-like particles (NLPs). In this aim, we plan to solve a novel series of structures that address the question about how the N protein helps the RdRp to recognize viral specific RNA sequences (such as the 3' genomic termini and transcriptional initiation sequences) within the nucleocapsid. These studies will be complemented with a look at structural changes in the N protein that affect transcription and replication. This will be accomplished by studying a series of mutant N proteins with phenotypes that affect these enzymatic processes. These mutants suggest that the N protein itself plays a role in regulation of transcription and replication. In Aim 2, we will examine polynucleotide synthesis from the role of the L and P proteins. We have engineered a series of L protein fragments that are soluble. The N- and C-terminal regions have already been crystallized with the N-terminal domain diffracting to >2.8Ã… resolution. We will determine structures for several domains of L. These will
be integrated with EM studies of the L, P and N proteins aimed at reconstructing the larger tripartite replicase complex and nucleocapsids. Collectively, the studies proposed here will address both replication and transcription of NSV from two perspectives, the template as well as the machinery involved in these essential enzymatic processes. The outcome of our studies may yield information that will promote future drug design strategies against this group of pathogens.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses encode a functionally conserved set of proteins that serve to duplicate their genomes and produce functional viral mRNAs.

1OT2OD027070-01,Population-Scale Clinical Genomics,"The production of genomic data for the All of Us Research Program (AoU) is an unprecedented
opportunity to support a comprehensive precision medicine effort that benefits the entire U.S. population. With
the participation from patients, family members, researchers and clinicians, this opportunity will impact clinical
management by directing patient care, enabling pre-symptomatic genetic testing of relatives, guiding familyplanning
measures, and triggering healthcare interventions.
We propose to create the HudsonAlpha Consortium for Population Genomics (HACPG) for AoU as
a platform for high quality microarray, sequence, and clinical interpretation of high-value variants. The HACPG
will leverage the experience and breadth of our clinical team and consortium members to allow accurate and
cost-effective production of annotated variant data from the largest number of cases and samples possible.
The data we generate will be formatted and transferred to the program Data Resource Center (DRC) to
facilitate return of clinical results to the Genetic Counseling Resource as directed by the program. Our overarching
strategy in developing this proposal is to combine best-in-field teams to form a consortium dedicated to
enabling scalable genomics in an evolvable platform. This platform will easily support advancements in the
genomics field, efficiently combining existing technical and analytic resources. Our efforts will facilitate a path
to move unbiased genetic testing such as whole-genome sequencing to routine use in healthcare and lifestyle
management.
The roles and relationships of HACPG consortium members are summarized below (Fig 1.1). HACPG
is a collaboration between HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (lead institution, sequencing, and
clinical validation laboratory), Rutgers University (sample intake, quality control and genotyping), University
of Utah (data analysis), Fabric Genomics (clinical reporting) and Helix (return of results and value add). With
the significant expansion of sequencing volume in years 2-5 of AoU, the HACPG will expand to include Baylor
College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center Clinical Lab (HGSC-CL) to provide a known and
trusted partner to expand the capacity of the consortium to support the requested volumes (see Letters of
Support 7.4 to 7.6 in Section 7).
As lead institution, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology benefits from a unique background.
HudsonAlpha was founded ten years ago with a mission to improve genomic literacy and support the
application of genomic technologies in education, research, healthcare and economic development. Since its
founding, HudsonAlpha has grown significantly in each of its mission areas and has made significant
contributions to the genomics field. Some key highlights and unique accomplishments with references to the
relevant sections of our proposal are:
â€¢ HudsonAlpha established the first CAP-accredited, CLIA licensed lab offering whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) and currently has capacity for sequencing over 70,000 clinical genomes per year
(please see Section 2.C.1).
â€¢ HudsonAlpha has generated ~30X+ genomes from thousands of individuals and returned definitive
diagnoses for hundreds of patients through our UDN and CSER programs (please see Section 3).
â€¢ HudsonAlpha is co-leading the Alabama Genomics Health Initiative; a program that mirrors many of
the features of AoU and has provided vital early perspectives on population scale programs that
utilize multiple technologies (please see Section 3).
â€¢ Although HudsonAlpha has resources to support the full AoU scope of work, we have made strategic
partnerships to provide the best available options and flexibility to AoU, especially in the later years
of the program (please see this section and Figure 1.1).
â€¢ HudsonAlpha has production-scale experience with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 demonstrated by
more than 25,000 whole-genomes or equivalents in the first half of 2018 (please see Section 2.C).
â€¢ We have developed a highly optimized library and sequencing platform that has proven scalability,
performance and integrity (please see Section 2.C.1).
â€¢ To match our sequencing production capabilities we have developed a scalable data analysis and
storage platform that is in production and fully validated (please see Section 2.C.2).
â€¢ We have develop an innovative interpretation and return of results strategy that has opportunities for
strong scalability and development should the AoU program expand and pursue direct-to-consumer
return for non-clinical variants (please see Section 3.D).
â€¢ We have presented an innovative validation strategy to leverage long-read sequencing technologies
to offer a cost and accuracy not possible with Sanger (please see Section 2.D.).",,2019,6999491,5627051,1372440,Other,OT2,NIH Office of the Director,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,AL,HUNTSVILLE,Research Institutes,358062908,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Health Services; Human Genome; Precision Medicine,Jane  Grimwood

in the Southeastern US, including Childrenâ€™s of Alabama, the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, the University
of Mississippi Medical Center, and the University of South Alabama. Each institution has its own network of referral
hospitals, clinical trial infrastructure and experience enrolling in stroke clinical trials. The result is that a large part
of the Stroke Belt will have access to StrokeNet Clinical Trials. The SBSN will succeed by leveraging key attributes of
our region and network. First, the SBSN RCC will offer combined access to nearly 3,500 acute stroke patients
annually, many of them minorities, in an underserved part of the US. As in our NeuroNext program, we will
aggressively pursue the inclusion of underrepresented and minority populations in our clinical trials through
collaboration with the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center (MHRC) and Strengthening
Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE). Second, UAB and its partners have a track record of patientâ€
oriented stroke research and successful stroke clinical trial recruitment. Over the last 3 years, UAB alone has
participated in 20 NIHâ€ or industryâ€sponsored multicenter phase 1, 2 and 3 trials in stroke treatment, prevention,
and recovery, enrolling 401 patients. We were nationallyâ€leading recruiters in the TUCSON, CUFFS, CLOTBUSTâ€HF,
SAMMPRIS and CLEAR III trials. We actively enrolled in the first StrokeNet trial, DEFUSE3, are currently enrolling in
CRESTâ€2, and preparing for participation in ARCADIA and CRESTâ€H. We are the leading recruiting center in MyRIAD
and the second leading center for MISTIE III. Over the last 3 years, SBSN institutions/investigators have participated
in a total of 37 trials in stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery, and enrolled a total of 2050 subjects. Third, we
have extensive experience in stroke recovery with specific expertise in strokeâ€related aphasia
recovery/rehabilitation, TMS and imaging, motor recovery, teleâ€rehabilitation and robotics. Fourth, our proposed
network will be strengthened by the alreadyâ€strong connections between the UAB Center for Clinical and

our partners, and already have experience with master IRB reliance agreements. Fifth, our research program will
build upon our alreadyâ€successful recruitment by applying a performance improvement approach to enhance
clinical trial screening, enrollment and retention. Strategies include specific screening, enrollment and retention
methods; rigorous and continuous monitoring and performance improvement of trial implementation and subject
screening, enrollment and retention; training and sharing of best practices; and programs to enhance engagement
and enthusiasm of investigators and coordinators across the network. Sixth, the training of stroke clinical scientists

75N91019D00019-0-759101900132-1,Task Order: Colorectal Cancer Prevention by a Novel EPA Analogue TP-252 and Naproxen in FAP and lynch syndrome models,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (LS) are hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes that are definable high-risk populations for clinical prevention studies. FAP is a colon polyposis and CRC predisposition syndrome caused by germ-line APC mutations. Frequent colonoscopy and prophylactic colectomy are standard of care. While several clinical and animal studies have demonstrated chemopreventive efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for FAP, there are no FDA-approved drugs for this indication. LS is the most common hereditary CRC syndrome, affecting >1 million Americans. LS is caused by mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 or in EPCAM, resulting in deficient DNA MMR and confers 70-80% lifetime risk of developing CRC. Thus, FAP and LS are well defined patient populations with up to 90% lifetime CRC risk that are highly likely to benefit from effective CRC chemoprevention.
Omega (Ï‰)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), suppress intestinal polyp formation. A diet containing the free fatty acid form of EPA (EPA-FFA) reduced polyp burden in ApcMin/+ mice. Importantly, treatment of FAP patients for 6 months with EPA-FFA showed 22% and 30% net reduction in colon polyp number and size, in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The underlying mechanism of the tumor-suppressive activity of EPA is its ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid (AA) oxygenation. EPA-FFA significantly increases intestinal mucosal EPA content effectively displacing AA from membrane phospholipids. Both AA and EPA serve as substrates for the cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) that collaborate in the formation of a complex array of bioactive lipid metabolites. Several metabolic products formed from AA, including PGE2, are strongly associated with CRC promotion. However, minor structural differences between AA and EPA alter synthesis of many lipid metabolites, which contributes to the tumor-suppressive properties of the Ï‰-3 PUFAs. However, high-purity EPA-FFA rapidly oxidizes. A novel ionic derivative of EPA, magnesium l-lysinate biseicosapentaenoate (TP-252), which is chemically more stable and more effective at inhibiting PGE2 and other tumor-promoting metabolites, is specifically designed to deliver therapeutic levels of EPA-FFA to the intestinal mucosa. Recently TP-252 was evaluated for its efficacy in ApcÎ”14/+ mice. NSAID naproxen inhibits COXs and has shown benefit against CRC in preclinical models. In clinical studies for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and juvenile arthritis, Naproxen has similar efficacy but fewer side effects than aspirin or indomethacin. Naproxen is the most effective NSAID to increase survival of LS/HNPCC mice. Using an intestine and colorectum targeted Msh2 deletion LS mouse model, Fishel et al. tested different NSAIDs on LS model survival. Treatment with dietary naproxen (331 ppm) almost doubled LS mice survival compared to 400 ppm aspirin treatment. These preclinical data led to the initiation of NCI-DCP Clinical Consortium study Phase Ib Biomarker Trial of Naproxen in Lynch Syndrome Mutation Carrier (NCT02052908). The overall goal of the project is to evaluate whether TP-252 alone or in combination with naproxen will reduce CRC tumor burden in two rodent genetic models; a highly penetrant APC-mutant rat, Pirc, that models FAP, and an innovative novel VcMsh2Thu mouse that models LS.",,2019,952235,,,R and D Contracts,N01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Arthritis; Autoimmune Disease; Cancer; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Digestive Diseases; Nutrition; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Rheumatoid Arthritis,Clinton  Grubbs
75N91019D00019-0-759101900130-1,TASK ORDER:  EVALUATION OF TWO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF COMPOUNDS (STAT3 INHIBITORS AND SERMS) FOR THE PREVENTION OF URINARY BLADDER CANCER,"Urinary bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies of the urinary system, with over 80,000 new cases predicted in the United States in 2019. Although 70% of patients initially present with non-muscle-invasive disease, urinary bladder tumors have a high rate of recurrence (50 â€“70%), and 10-15% will progress to muscle-invasive disease within a 5-year period, making the prevention of bladder cancer an important priority. Throughout the years, a relatively large number of compounds have been tested for efficacy in the prevention of early stage bladder cancers. However, many of these agents have proven to be largely ineffective or toxic to various organs. Thus, there is a need for the identification of new chemopreventive agents with novel mechanisms of action.

Estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±) is expressed in 18% of patients with bladder cancer and is associated with highly proliferative tumors and lower overall survival; ERÎ² is expressed in 63% of bladder cancer tumors, and the degree of ERÎ² expression increases with increasing stage and grade of differentiation. These correlations, combined with the findings that N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)-treated mice lacking ERÎ² have a reduced incidence of bladder cancer, suggest that the ER could serve as a target for preventive intervention. In support of this, several groups have reported that estrogen receptor modulators reduce bladder cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and reduce cancer incidence in BBN-treated mice. This Task Order will evaluate the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene for bladder cancer prevention. Bazedoxifene has affinity for both the ERÎ± and ERÎ² receptors, and it is a competitive inhibitor of 17-Î²-estradiol at either estrogen receptor. It is also highly effective as a chemopreventive agent in the N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU)-rat model, in which breast cancer development is driven by expression of the ER.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of the seven members of a family of transcription factors that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the immune response. Although the activation of STAT3 is transient and highly regulated in normal cells, it is constitutively active in several types of cancer, including bladder cancer. The findings that the expression of dominant-negative STAT3 inhibits bladder tumor formation and that the STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 reduces cell survival and proliferation of bladder cancer cells support a role for STAT3 in bladder cancer carcinogenesis and suggest that STAT3 could serve as a target for preventive intervention. This Task Order will also investigate the chemopreventive potential of the STAT3 inhibitor GLG-302 and its structural analogs in a model of human bladder cancer. GLG-302 reduces tumor multiplicity in the MMTV-Neu mouse model of mammary cancer, and its structural analogs, including SH5-07, BP-1-102, and SH4-54, are reported to have improved bioavailability and in vitro potency.

75N91019D00019-0-759101900131-1,"FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF COLOVAC, A MULTI-ANTIGEN MULTI-PEPTIDE VACCINE, FOR COLON CANCER PREVENTION","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women, and the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 years and continuing until 75 years of age for asymptomatic adults with average risk of CRC and without a family history of known genetic disorders associated with an increased risk of CRC such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). While the evidence supports that CRC-screening confers a substantial benefit overall, there will be an estimated 145,600 new CRC cases and 51,020 deaths from CRC expected in 2019. In addition to screening and early detection, prevention strategies that can further reduce the CRC risk will be of great benefit, in particular in high risk populations. A number of previous studies have shown that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of cancers, including CRC. However, their extended use can be associated with serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Safer and more efficacious approaches are needed for durable long-term CRC prevention.

Cancer vaccines targeting tumor-associated antigens (TAA) overexpressed in pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions may elicit antitumor immunity that intercepts tumorigenic process and eliminates precancerous cells before they progress to form a full-blown cancer. Recent advances in immunotherapies for various cancers have clearly shown that the immune system can mount effective antitumor immune responses if tumor-associated immunosuppression is abrogated, for example, by immune checkpoint blockade. It is conceivable that effective antitumor immunity may be more efficiently elicited by active immunization against TAA in the cancer prevention setting, as tumor-derived immunosuppressive mechanisms may play a lesser role in premalignant lesions. If long-term immunological memory can be established, such cancer vaccines can serve as a safer and more effective approach to cancer prevention.  

One of the most important steps toward developing effective cancer preventive vaccines is the selection of the antigens. Disis and colleagues have previously shown that high binding affinity across multiple HLA class II alleles predicts immunogenic human epitopes. They developed a scoring system designed to identify epitopes with optimal binding affinity and promiscuity across multiple class II alleles. Using the scoring algorithms, they demonstrated that peptides selected from the identified immunogenic hotspots of the target protein could induce robust antigen-specific type 1 T cell response in cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Immunization with these peptides mediated an antitumor effect in preclinical models of tumorigenesis. They further optimized the epitope selection process by eliminating Th2-epitopes from candidate peptides and demonstrated that highly robust protective immunity could be elicited by a multi-peptide vaccine with potent antitumor activity.

Current approaches to the development of preventive vaccines for non-viral cancers are centered on strategies to target known oncogenic proteins. However, novel and more broadly applicable promising target antigens for preventive cancer vaccines may be identified from careful analyses of genes that are overexpressed in premalignant and malignant tissues but not in normal tissues. Disis et al. have recently reported highly immunogenic Th1-promoting epitopes from three TAAs, CDC25B, COX2 and EGFR, all of which are overexpressed in CRC and associated with poor disease outcomes. They showed these selected TAA-peptide based vaccine, referred to as Colovac, induced type 1 immunity and decreased tumor burden in preclinical models of intestinal tumorigenesis. Separately, her group has also demonstrated that NSAIDs significantly reduced polyp formation while increasing the number of CD8+ T-cell infiltrates in polyps in ApcMin/+ mice.

This study is based on the work performed under the Task Order HHSN261201500036I/ HHSN26100004 (https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9360921), which focused on determining immunologic synergy and antitumor activity of the combination regimen of Colovac and naproxen in preclinical models of intestinal tumorigenesis.

261201500036I-P00001-26100011-1,Further Development of Multi-Antigen Vaccines for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Bladder Cancer ,"Bladder cancer ranks as the ninth most frequently-diagnosed cancer worldwide, with the highest incidence rates observed in men in Southern and Western Europe, North America, as well as in certain countries in Northern Africa or Western Asia. Incidence rates are consistently lower in women than men, although sex differences varied greatly between countries [1].  Even though 70 to 80% of patients are diagnosed with superficial disease, bladder cancer has a high overall rate of recurrence at approximately 65% [2].  Since the pioneering work of Morales et al. in 1976 [3], intravesical BCG has been the standard-of-care immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer since 1990.  BCG immunotherapy results in 70â€“75% and 50â€“60% complete response rates for carcinoma-in-situ and small residual tumors, respectively [2]. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of patients will fail initial BCG therapy and approximately 30â€“50% of BCG responders will develop recurrent tumors within 5 years [4, 5]. Therefore, despite the effectiveness of BCG, additional therapies are needed to limit recurrence and improve survival for both BCG responders and non-responders.
	
Evaluation of the genomic data of bladder cancer has shown that about half of
patients as having highly mutated tumors [6].  While other tumors have a lower mutational burden, these can be characterized by dozens of gene amplifications.  Both mutated proteins and overexpressed proteins can be exploited as tumor antigens and potential vaccine candidates.  Currently, the most common tumor antigens exploited in cancer immunotherapy are up-regulated self-proteins, such as HER2.  While mutated epitopes are recognized as foreign â€œneo-antigensâ€ by the immune system eliciting Type I response, epitopes derived from non-mutated self-antigens are more likely to trigger Th2 polarizing cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6 that inhibit CTL proliferation and function.  

Recently attempts have been made to identify Th1 selective epitopes from non-mutated self-antigens that could elicit a â€œneo-antigenâ€ like response.  The Th1 selective epitopes, when used in a vaccine, can elicit unopposed Type I immunity and are effective in preventing cancer growth in pre-clinical models [7].  If Th2 inducing epitopes from the same protein are included in a vaccine, Th2 cells elicited by immunization will abrogate the anti-tumor effect of Th1[8, 9].  Therefore, the vaccines composed only of Th1 inducing epitopes may allow unrestricted expansion of both Th1 and CTL. Th1 selective non-mutated antigen vaccines may be effective in preventing disease recurrence and progression.  If the antigens are expressed early in oncogenesis, vaccines could have utility in prevention.  

	Novel and more promising target antigens for preventive cancer vaccines may be identified from careful analyses of molecular alterations such as overexpressed genes in premalignant and/or malignant tissues discovered through the TCGA and other cancer genomics projects.  Some of the genes overexpressed in premalignant and malignant lesions, but not in normal tissues, could be immunogenic and capable of eliciting protective antitumor immune responses.  High priority candidate genes can be selected from the list of overexpressed genes by employing a systematic approach, for example, based on differential expression patterns between premalignant or malignant lesions vs. normal tissues, functional roles in physiologic or oncogenic signaling pathways, and immunogenicity prediction and in vitro screening processes.  Once candidate target proteins are selected, peptide based vaccines may be designed following the scoring methods developed by Disis et al. [10] and can be preclinically tested for in vivo immunogenicity and tumor preventive efficacy in relevant models.  These kind of rational design strategies may help expedite the discovery and development of an efficacious cancer vaccine for prevention of various cancers including cancer of the bladder.

This is a companion Task Order to the work on the bladder cancer vaccine development undertaken under the previously issued Task Order (TO) HHSN26100006 under the IDIQ contract HHSN2612015000361 (hereafter referred to as TO#6).  The TO#6 was the result of an application to the NCI PREVENT Program submitted by Dr. Mary L. Disis at the University of Washington.

261201500036I-P00001-26100010-1,"Preclinical development of a chemopreventive agent, 4-methylumbelliferone(4-MU) HHSN2512015000361 TORFP: 2018-E07 PP: 9/17/18 to 9/16/19","Abstract:
4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) (M.W. 176), also known as hymechromone or 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, is a coumarin derivative with choleretic and spasmolytic properties. It is an approved drug for the treatment of biliary dyskinesia in Europe and Asia, where it is also consumed as a dietary supplement to improve liver health. 4-MU is known to inhibit biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid (HA), in part by competing with uridine diphosphate (UDP) as a substrate for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). HA is synthesized by HA synthases from its precursors, UDP-glucuronic acid (UGA) and UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine, both of which are generated by the UGT-mediated transfer of UDP to glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-glucosamine, respectively. By inhibiting UGT, 4-MU depletes the cytosolic pool of UGA, thereby reducing HA synthesis. 4-MU has also been shown to reduce the expression levels of HA synthases, although the impact of downregulations of these enzymes on HA synthesis is not fully understood. 
For over the last decade, 4-MU has been reported to exert anti-tumor and tumor-preventive activities in vitro and in vivo against wide spectrum of cancers, including cancers of prostate, kidney, pancreas, ovary, colon, liver and skin. These antitumor activities have been attributed to the ability of 4-MU to inhibit HA biosynthesis, as HA signaling is known to play a critical role in tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and neovascularization. Higher levels of HA and HAS have been demonstrated in more advanced and aggressive cancers. 
Using the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, Dr. Vinata Lokeshwar and colleagues have previously reported that daily oral administration of 4-MU (450 mg/kg/day by gavage), started at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 22 weeks and continued through 28 weeks of age, significantly reduced prostate tumorigenesis without signs of overt toxicity in a treatment-timing dependent manner. TRAMP mice treated with 4-MU from 8 weeks or 12 weeks through 28 weeks of age had histologically normal prostates with areas of low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), which is considered characteristic of the 8-week old TRAMP mice prostate, without any organ metastasis, while the vehicle control mice were found to have invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate with metastatic lesions in the kidney, liver, and lung. The tumor suppressive effect of 4-MU continued to be observed in the TRAMP mice through 52 weeks of age even though the 4-MU treatment was stopped after 28 weeks. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy observed in the 4-MU treated mice was associated with the decreased levels of HA expression, accompanied by reduced Ki67-positive cells and microvessel density counts with the increased level of E-cadherin expression in the prostate tissue. These findings supported the potential utility of 4-MU as a nontoxic oral chemopreventive agent for prostate and other cancers.
Pharmacokinetics and safety of 4-MU have previously been studied in clinical trials involving healthy volunteers and patients requiring cholecystectomy. Excellent safety profiles have been clinically demonstrated for short-term daily administrations of 4MU at 1200 mg to 2400 mg per day. Factors negatively affecting the utility of 4-MU are its short half-life (~30 min) and low oral bioavailability, which has been reported to be less than 3% in humans. 4-MU is extensively metabolized to a glucuronic acid (4-MUG) via UGT or a sulfate form (4-MUS). Glucuronidation is believed to account for more than 90% of 4-MU metabolism. 4-MUG is biliary eliminated and likely undergoes reabsorption from the intestine (enterohepatic recycling) for eventual elimination by the kidney, although pharmacokinetics (PK) of 4-MUG has not been well studied. Considering the working hypothesis for the mode of antitumor action of 4-MU, which requires a non-metabolized form of 4-MU molecule to serve as a competitive substrate for UGT, its tumor preventive activity may be significantly improved if a new formulation of 4-MU can be developed to target the lymphatic system while avoiding the first pass metabolism in the liver. Such a lymphatic targeting drug delivery approach is expected to increase 4-MU concentrations in non-hepatic organs.  
As a result of an application to the NCI PREVENT Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program submitted by Dr. Vinata Lokeshwar of the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, a new formulation of 4-MU, 4-MU myristate (MUM), has been developed through the DCP Repository Program in coordination with PREVENT. The preliminary PK study of MUM conducted by the DCP Repository demonstrated that higher accumulations of 4-MU and its metabolite MUG were demonstrated in the bladder followed by the prostate in a multi-dosing mouse study.  The data suggested that MUM may be useful for the prevention of invasive bladder cancer. The current study is focused on the further development of the newly formulated 4-MU, MUM, including the evaluation of its PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles and tumor preventive efficacy using a preclinical model of bladder tumorigenesis.",,2019,857168,,,R and D Contracts,N01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cancer; Dietary Supplements; Digestive Diseases; Nutrition; Prevention; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases,Clinton  Grubbs
5R01EY026588-04,Scleral Remodeling in Myopia,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The prevalence of myopia in the U.S. population is constantly growing, increasing the risk for associated
blinding diseases such as glaucoma and retinal detachment. A myopic eye is too long for its own optics and
there is currently no accepted method to prevent, slow or control myopia progression. Increasing evidence
suggest that the eye's axial length is modulated by unknown growth and remodeling mechanisms in the sclera.
Our goal is to elucidate these mechanisms and to develop a treatment strategy based on scleral crosslinking
(SXL) using subconjunctival injections of a low cytotoxicity collagen crosslink agent. Our central hypotheses
are that scleral collagen remodeling underlies myopia progression, and that SXL can be used to control scleral
remodeling and inhibit myopia progression. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the key growth and
remodeling mechanisms in myopia, and to provide a safe and effective treatment modality to control myopia
progression.
 We will use an established experimental model of myopia, innovative imaging techniques, and multi-scale
computational simulation tools to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlies scleral remodeling in myopia.
We test the hypothesis that SXL inhibits myopia progression while permitting physiological eye development
and maintaining retinal structure and function. We will use principals of engineering and material science to
quantify scleral remodeling in the sclera and to test the hypotheses that scleral deformations increase at
different length-scales during myopia development and decrease after SXL.
 Support for scleral remodeling control by SXL could be directly translated to a new clinical treatment
strategy for myopia. Even if our results do not support the safe usage of SXL for myopia control, the knowledge
we gain about scleral growth and remodeling and its quantification would lead to a completely new
understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms underlying myopia development, and would provide a powerful
platform to develop alternative clinical control modalities of myopia.","Project Narrative

5R01EY027759-03,The influence of ocular remodeling on glaucoma,"Abstract
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, yet the reason for retinal ganglion cell damage within the
optic nerve head (ONH) is not fully understood. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered the primary
cause of glaucoma, but epidemiologic studies identify moderate or high myopia as an independent risk factor.
Currently, the connection between these two diseases is unknown. We propose that there is a biomechanical
basis underlying this interaction. Our central hypothesis is that scleral and ONH remodeling that leads to high
myopia is one of many factors increasing the risk for subsequent pathologic ONH remodeling and glaucoma
later in life. With myopia reaching epidemic proportions in portions of the world, and the prevalence of
glaucoma continuing to increase, understanding the basic mechanisms underlying these disease processes is
critical.
We will leverage our unique tree shrew model of experimental myopia and glaucoma, a combination of in vivo
and ex vivo experiments, and in silico multiscale simulation tools to examine the biomechanical basis for the
link between myopia and glaucoma. The grant will focus on three primary areas of interest: 1) We will examine
the ocular biomechanical changes that occur within the sclera and ONH during high myopia development in
tree shrews. 2) We will determine whether scleral remodeling that leads to high myopia predisposes an animal
to accelerated pathologic ONH remodeling and increased axon loss in experimental glaucoma. And, 3) We will
use multiscale modeling to elucidate the interacting biomechanical mechanisms underlying glaucoma and high
myopia. This knowledge will be used to develop novel targets for future glaucoma therapies.","Project Narrative
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, yet we are still trying to develop a fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms that cause this disease. While we know that increased eye pressure is a risk

5R01DE023090-09,CELLULAR AND ION CHANNEL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE SENSE OF LIGHT TOUCH IN MAMMAL,"ABSTRACT: Tactile sensitivity of detecting gentle mechanical stimuli or touch is critically important in life but
can be impaired to result in reduction/loss of tactile sensitivity (numbness) under pathological conditions.
Numbness is the earliest and most common symptom of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN)
that negatively impacts quality of life in cancer patients, and it is a dose-limiting factor of chemotherapy.
Numbness of CIPN is poorly treated and its underlying mechanism understudied. This lack of knowledge
prevents development of effective management for numbness CIPN. â™¦ A Merkel disc is a main type of tactile
end organ located in touch sensitive spots throughout the body but most abundant at the human fingertips and
whisker hair follicles of all non-primate mammals. A Merkel disc consists of a Merkel cell and an AÎ²-afferent
ending to form a synapse-like structure. We and others have recently discovered that tactile stimuli to Merkel
discs are largely transduced in Merkel cells by Piezo2 channels, which drive most AÎ²-afferent impulses and
behavioral tactile responses. More recently, we have further identified that Merkel discs in whisker hair follicles
are serotonergic synapses, and serotonin is released from Merkel cells in response to tactile stimuli to
subsequently drive AÎ²-afferent impulses and behavioral tactile responses. â™¦ In this renewal application, our
new focuses are to study how tactile sensitivity at Merkel discs is modulated and whether the tactile sensitivity
can be impaired by chemotherapy drugs to account for the numbness aspect of CINP. â™¦ We propose to use
whisker hair follicle preparation to address these questions with 3 specific aims: Aim 1) Elucidate
mechanisms underlying the modulation of Merkel disc tactile sensitivity. This Aim will focus on whether
serotonin transporters play a key role in regulating Merkel disc serotonergic transmission and Merkel disc
tactile sensitivity. Aim 2: Determine whether and how chemotherapy drugs impair Merkel disc tactile
sensitivity. This Aim will measure changes of serotonergic transmission and Merkel disc tactile sensitivity
following chemotherapy drug treatment, and identify pre- and postsynaptic molecules at Merkel discs that are
targeted by chemotherapy drugs to result in the impairment of Merkel disc tactile sensitivity. Aim 3: Determine
whether targeting Merkel discs by chemotherapy drugs leads to impairment of behavioral tactile
responses. This Aim will determine whether chemotherapy drugs can impair whisker tactile behavioral
responses via suppressing Merkel disc serotonergic transmission, and whether potentiation of Merkel disc
serotonergic transmission by pharmacologically manipulating serotonin transporters can rescue the impaired
whisker tactile behavioral responses. â™¦ Completion of the 3 Aims will fill a scientific gap about tactile sensitivity
of mammals, elucidate novel mechanisms underlying numbness aspect of CIPN, and identify potential
therapeutic targets for rescuing impaired tactile sensitivity.","Narrative:

1R01NS109059-01,Ion channels and their functions at the node of Ranvier of mammalian somatosensory afferent fibers,"Nodes of Ranvier are highly specialized axonal regions on myelinated nerve fibers of sensory, motor and
central nervous systems where action potentials are propagated by saltatory (leap in Latin word) conduction.
Saltatory conduction through nodes of Ranvier ensures timely sensory and motor responses and precise signal
processing in the CNS. A number of neurological diseases affect nodes of Ranvier to impair saltatory
conduction leading to motor disorders, such as paralysis and sensory dysfunctions, such as pain, numbness,
and other abnormal sensations. Knowledge of ion channels and their functions at mammalian nodes of Ranvier
is a key to fully understanding saltatory conduction under both physiological and pathological conditions, and
for potential treatments of those sensory and motor disorders. The overall goal of this project is to study ion
channel mechanisms for securing saltatory conduction of action potentials at mammalian nodes of Ranvier.
We have recently developed the in situ patch-clamp recording technique for nodes of Ranvier in
somatosensory afferent fibers of rats. In the preliminary studies we have found that nodes of Ranvier express
surprisingly high levels of the two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P channels), a unique family of ion
channels that constitutively open, and the function of which, in action potentials, as well as in nerve conduction
was previously unknown. Functionally, our preliminary studies strongly suggest that K2P channels are key
molecules for securing saltatory conduction in myelinated somatosensory afferent fibers of mammals. In this
application, we will use the in situ patch-clamp recording technique in conjunction with pharmacology, gene
knockdown, and immunochemistry approaches to achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize
K2P channels and elucidate their molecular identities at the node of Ranvier of rat somatosensory
afferent fibers. In this aim we will pin down K2P channel subtypes at the node of Ranvier and profile their
pharmacological and single channel properties. Aim 2. Study specific roles of K2P channels in securing
saltatory conduction at the node of Ranvier of rat somatosensory afferent fibers. This aim will elucidate
that the K2P channels at the node of Ranvier play a key role in rapid action potential repolarization and in
securing high speed and high frequency saltatory conduction. Aim 3. Elucidate that K2P channels at the
node of Ranvier play a key role in temperature-dependent saltatory conduction on rat somatosensory
afferent fibers. This aim will test the idea that K2P channels at the node of Ranvier are highly thermal
sensitive, which is a determinant factor controlling the velocity and fidelity of saltatory conduction at different
temperatures. This aim exemplifies that biological factors affecting K2P channel activity will highly impact
saltatory conductions in myelinated nerve fibers. Completion of the 3 Aims will elucidate a novel ion channel
mechanism that secures saltatory conduction, which may have implications in sensory and motor disorders
with impaired saltatory conduction at the node of Ranvier.","The proposed research will elucidate key ion channels that secure saltatory conduction at mammalian nodes of

5R01DK106500-03,Sphingosine-1-phosphate in renal microvascular dysfunction of ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (IR-AKI), a significant unsolved
clinical problem. A critical barrier to progress with IR-AKI is that there are gaps in our scientific
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the persistent reduction of medullary blood flow (MBF), a key
factor determining the outcome of IR-AKI and the progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our goal is to
address this critical barrier by focusing on the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as a potential signaling
molecule contributing to renal microvascular dysfunction in IR-AKI. Our central hypothesis is that renal
ischemia-reperfusion leads to significantly enhanced sensitivity of juxtamedullary afferent arterioles, the crucial
vascular segment that controls MBF, to S1P-mediated vasoconstriction which contributes to a persistent
reduction of MBF and a steady decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in IR-AKI. Our objectives are to
address this central hypothesis by (1) determining the role of S1P in controlling juxtamedullary afferent
arteriolar function and renal hemodynamics in IR-AKI; (2) establishing the cellular mechanisms of S1P-
dependent regulation of afferent arteriolar reactivity in IR-AKI; and (3) determining the pathophysiological role
of S1P in the development of renal microvascular dysfunction in IR-AKI. We will test this central hypothesis
through three specific aims. AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that renal ischemia-reperfusion leads to enhanced
sensitivity of afferent arterioles to S1P which contributes to a persistent vasoconstriction and reduction of MBF
in IR-AKI. AIM 2 will test the hypothesis that the renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced increase in reactive
oxygen species production contributes to enhanced S1P sensitivity of afferent arterioles in IR-AKI. AIM 3 will
test the hypothesis that inhibition of S1P receptor activation prevents enhancement of S1P-mediated afferent
arteriolar vasoconstriction during ischemia-reperfusion and protects against IR-AKI. We will use the in vitro
blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique to assess the impact of IR on S1P-mediated arteriolar
response in rats and in S1P2 receptor knockout mice. We will determine the influence of S1P on total and
regional renal blood flow and GFR with IR-AKI. We will determine which S1P receptors contribute to enhanced
S1P-mediated vasoconstriction. We will measure sphingolipid metabolites in kidney and plasma of IR rats or
mice. Our outcomes will provide new mechanistic insights that renal IR activates the S1P signaling pathway
in the renal microvasculature. Exogenous S1P causes potent vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles and
reduction of renal blood flow and MBF, which will be enhanced in IR-AKI. S1P2 receptor blockade or deletion
will protect against IR-AKI. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms underlying the persistent reduction of MBF and a steady decline in GFR in IR-AKI. Improving
MBF by inhibiting S1P2R signaling may represent a new therapeutic target for treating IR-AKI and preventing
progression to CKD, thereby having a major impact in the field.","Project Narrative

5P30DK074038-15,The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Translational Resource: Core A,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and other hepato-renal fibrocystic diseases
(HRFD) are relatively rare recessive disorders, but constitute an important set of childhood nephropathies.
Rare disease research requires greater collaboration than the efforts in common diseases where patient
resources are routinely available and large repositories can be built locally. For the HRFD, experimental
studies would be well served by case accrual that coordinates collection of clinical data, bio-specimens (DNA
and tissues) and mutational information. The centralization and sharing of clinical and genetic information, as
well as bio-materials, can provide a critical impetus for more rapid progress by the research community.
 In this competitive renewal, we will continue to compile baseline and longitudinal clinical information in our
HRFD Clinical Database; expand our bio-materials (DNA and tissue) repositories; and deploy new strategies to
identify genetic mutations in ARPKD and other HFRD patients, including new tools to interpret PKHD1
missense variants. Clinical and genetic data, as well as patient bio-specimens, will be drawn from tertiary care
centers throughout the Americas (North, Central, and South). Finally, we will utilize the learning management
system established in our CTSA-funded program to establish a multi-modality resource for our expanding
portfolio of HRFD-related educational information and tools.
 Our goal for this renewal application is to acquire a sufficient volume of clinical data, biological
specimens, and genomic information in a centralized resource to accelerate discovery research in human
HRFD and integrate the resulting data in an enabling platform for developing new, targeted interventional
strategies, assessing genotype-phenotype correlations, and identifying new disease genes by our Investigator
User Base, as well as other members of the research community.

7R03CA221926-02,PERSONALIZED THERAPY FOR p16-DEFICIENT MELANOMA,"Project Summary
Melanoma account for over 10,000 deaths annually in the United States alone and current therapies for
advanced-stage melanoma do not provide durable clinical benefit. Therefore, improved molecular
understanding of melanoma is essential for developing effective therapies. According to The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) melanoma data over 45% melanoma lack tumor suppressor p16. However, there is no specific
personalized treatment option available for p16-deficient melanoma. Therefore, we performed an innovative
large-scale druggable genome RNAi screen and identified Cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase as a candidate
that is necessary for the survival of p16-deficient melanoma. shRNA-induced knockdown of CDC7 inhibited
p16-deficient melanoma tumors and metastases in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that p16-deficient
melanoma depends upon CDC7 for their survival and CDC7 inhibition will be of therapeutic value for treating
p16-deficient melanoma. The overall objective is to determine the effect of genetic and pharmacological
inhibition of CDC7 on melanoma tumor growth and metastasis and understand why CDC7 is necessary for
p16-deficient melanoma. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the effect of genetic and pharmacological
inhibition of CDC7 on melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. To this end, will determine the role of CDC7 in
tumor growth and metastasis in the context of p16-deficiency. Additionally, using XL413, a small molecule
inhibitor of CDC7, alone or in combination with BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib (for melanoma co-harboring
both BRAFV600E mutation and p16-deficiency), we will determine if pharmacological inhibition of CDC7 alone
or in combination with BRAFV600E inhibitors can be employed to effectively treat p16-deficient melanoma in
vivo. The experimental approach will utilize mouse models of melanoma tumor growth and metastasis and will
utilize established and melanoma patient-derived short-term melanoma cultures available from Yale SPORE in
Skin Cancer. In Aim 2, we will determine why CDC7 is necessary for the survival of p16-deficient melanoma.
Using transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling and Tandem Affinity Purification and mass spectrometry-
based proteomics approaches, we find that the p16-deficient melanoma cells show activation of Unfolded
Protein Response (UPR) pathway and that CDC7 maintains the activity of UPR pathway potentially via
transcription factor HOXA1 to promote melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, we will determine
how CDC7 regulates UPR pathway via HOXA1 in p16-deficient melanoma cells. Additionally, we will test
whether CDC7-loss induced tumor growth and metastasis inhibition of p16-deficient melanoma cells can be
rescued by restoring HOXA1 expression and the UPR pathway activity. Collectively, we expect to uncover a
novel CDC7-driven druggable genetic vulnerability pathway that can be targeted for effective personalized
therapy of p16-deficient melanoma, including for highly aggressive metastatic melanoma.","PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE

15% advanced-stage melanoma patients survive beyond 5 years. Using a functional genomics approach of

1R03CA230815-01A1,A NOVEL EPIGENETIC IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR OVARIAN CANCER TREATMENT,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of deaths due to gynecological malignancies in women and will accounts
for over 14,000 deaths in the United States this year alone. However, current therapies do not provide
meaningful long-term clinical benefits to ovarian cancer patients. Therefore, new and more effective therapies
for ovarian cancer treatment are urgently needed. We found that ovarian cancer cells epigenetically
downregulate the Natural Killer Group 2 D (NKG2D) ligands that are necessary for Natural Killer (NK) cells of
innate immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Based on these findings, we rationalized that an approach
that will allow re-expression of NKG2D ligands will enhance NK cell-mediated eradication of ovarian cancer
cells and will be of therapeutic value. To identify such epigenetic drug targets that when inhibited will increase
the expression of NKG2D ligand in ovarian cancer cells, we performed a large-scale epigenome-wide shRNA
screen and identified Disruptor of Telomeric Silencing 1-Like (DOT1L) as a regulator of NKG2D ligand ULBP1.
We found that DOT1L inhibition by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) or by a small-molecule inhibitor, EPZ-5676,
significantly increased eradication of ovarian cancer cells by NK cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize
that DOT1L by regulating the expression of NKG2D ligands regulates NK cell-mediated eradication of ovarian
cancer cells. The overall objective is to rigorously determine the role of DOT1L as a driver of ovarian cancer
tumor growth and progression that function in a NK cell-dependent manner and test the clinical value of
pharmacologically inhibiting DOT1L for treating ovarian cancer. Aim 1 experiments will focus on determining
the in vivo role of DOT1L as a driver of ovarian cancer growth and ascertain if this function of DOT1L is
dependent on NK cells. To this end, based on our results in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models, we
will use a novel humanized mouse model with functional human immune system containing NK cells to test the
DOT1L inhibition in a more human disease relevant pre-clinical mouse model setting. We will also determine
the mechanism of DOT1L action. To this end, based on our preliminary results, we will test the role of NKG2D
ligands and other potential mechanisms, such as regulation of ICAM1 by DOT1L, in regulating the ability of
DOT1L on NK cell-mediated eradication of ovarian cancer. Aim 2 experiments will determine if
pharmacological inhibition of DOT1L in vivo blocks ovarian cancer growth in a NK cell-dependent manner. To
this end, we will determine if DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676, inhibits ovarian tumor growth in a NK cell-dependent
manner in humanized and in the pre-clinical patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ovarian cancer.
Collectively, the results of our studies will identify a novel function of DOT1L in regulating NK cell activity
against ovarian cancer cells in vivo and validate DOT1L small-molecule inhibitors to enhance NK cell function
as a new therapeutic approach for treating ovarian cancer.!","PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE
According to the estimates of the American Cancer Society over 22,440 women will be diagnosed with ovarian
cancer of which over 14,000 will die of their disease in the United States alone. Regrettably, current therapies
only provide short-term benefit that does not result in meaningful long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients
and therefore, new and more effective therapies are urgently needed for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In
this proposal, we will test a novel drug target DOT1L for treating ovarian cancer using genetic and
pharmacological approaches, which will allow us to develop a new and effective therapy for ovarian cancer
patients.!",2019,74250,50000,24250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Genetics; Immunotherapy; Orphan Drug; Ovarian Cancer; Rare Diseases,Romi  Gupta

term scientific goal of Dr. GutiÃ©rrez is to build a patient-oriented research (POR) program focused on
identifying novel strategies for reducing or eliminating disparities in health outcomes related to cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In order to accomplish this goal, Dr. GutiÃ©rrez recognizes
the critical importance of mentoring the next generation of clinician scientists who can develop the necessary
expertise to investigate root causes of disparities in a comprehensive and ethical manner. However, the
increasing demands on his time related to sustaining his professional effort for research as well as

3P30DK079337-12S1,Enhancing the capacity to examine the impact of acute kidney injury on disparities in chronic kidney disease outcomes in the Southeastern US,"The overarching goal of this competitive revision application is to extend the mission of the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)-University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Oâ€™Brien Center for Acute Kidney
Injury (AKI) Research by defining the impact of AKI on the excess burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
in the Southeastern US. The clustering of major CKD risk factors such as black race, obesity and diabetes
in our region is a key driver of the high prevalence of CKD in the Southeastern US. As such, identifying
potential interventions to reduce the incidence and progression of CKD in these vulnerable populations is
critical for reducing the substantial social and financial costs associated with CKD and related health
disparities (stroke, heart disease, death) in our region. AKI affects as many as 20% of hospitalized patients
and is a recognized risk factor for the development of CKD, cardiovascular disease and death. These
outcomes may be modifiable by care provided in the post-AKI period, yet optimum care for care of AKI
survivors is not well defined and is often fragmented after discharge. Disadvantaged patients are at
especially high risk for inappropriate follow-up and low quality of care, suggesting that disparities in AKI
outcomes contribute to the excess risk of incident and progressive CKD in high-risk populations in our
region. However, progress in this area is hampered by a lack of data on the degree to which differences in
AKI outcomes contribute to CKD disparities in the Southeastern US, and potential interventions that may
target these disparities. Accordingly, the primary focus of this application is to define the impact of AKI
during acute hospitalization on incident and progressive CKD; how these associations differ by race, obesity
and diabetes status; and pilot a dedicated AKI follow-up clinic as a potential intervention to address
disparities in these outcomes. Specifically, Aim 1 will leverage an established, ongoing regional CTSA
collaborationâ€”the Southeastern Shared Health Research Information Network (SE-SHRINE)â€”to examine
all hospitalized AKI patients within four centers (UAB, MUSC, UAMS, U Kentucky) and link them to the US
Renal Data Systems to define disparities in AKI outcomes ([i] severity and duration of AKI; [ii] recovery of
dialysis-dependent AKI or development of ESRD after discharge; and [iii] associated health disparities such
as death and cardiovascular disease) by race, obesity and diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility and
collect key efficacy measures of a dedicated AKI follow-up clinic for patients with AKI discharged to the
community at three Southeastern CTSA hubs (UAB, Vanderbilt, U Kentucky). We will leverage the
resources available in Oâ€™Brien Cores to integrate existing intellectual and technological resources of UAB
and facilitate the success of this project. This project will help build a collaborative research network for AKI

5R01DK112934-03,Glucagon Mediated Potentiation of Insulin Sensitivity in Glucose Metabolism,"Abstract
 The sedentary and dietary life style that evolved during the last decades has been paralleled by an
unprecedented increase in the incidence of metabolic disturbances such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity
and type-2 diabetes. Glucagon, the key counter-regulatory hormone opposing insulin action, is released during
periods of hypoglycemia by pancreatic alpha-cells to stimulate hepatic glucose production and restore
euglycemia. Accordingly, excessive glucagon signaling is a crucial pathophysiological component of diabetes
mellitus and these actions have been widely studied in both type 1 and 2 diabetic patients.
 Emerging evidence suggests that glucagon regulates a range of actions that may be quite desirable in
patients with the metabolic syndrome. Indeed, potential drug targets that contain glucagon agonism have
emerged as promising therapeutic candidates for obesity and diabetes. Yet, the targeted tissues and molecular
mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects are yet unknown. The scientific hypothesis that guides this
proposal is that glucagon, via its hepatic receptors (GcgR), potentiates TORC2-dependent components of
insulin-signaling cascade, which is further potentiated by hypothalamic GcgR signaling, to prime an individual
for enhanced whole-body glucose disposal. Under our hypothesis, the counterregulatory actions of glucagon
that maintain euglycemia during fasting, also engage mechanisms to potentiate subsequent insulin action. Our
hypothesis is formulated both on our preliminary and published data demonstrating enhanced glucose
tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in mice pretreated with
glucagon, or a potent glucagon-receptor agonist. However, how glucagon regulates insulin action, and the
tissues responsible for these combined insulin/glucagon-effects remain unresolved.","Project Narrative
 Emerging evidence suggests that glucagon-mediated improvements in lipid and energy metabolism may be
quite desirable in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Likewise, the addition of glucagon to the wearable,
bionic (insulin) pancreas prevents not only the life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes that plague diabetics,
but also results in a reduction in average glycemic levels. As such, a targeted search to elucidate the
underlying molecular mechanism/s of glucagon-mediated improvements in insulin action, especially in light of
glucagonâ€™s diabetogenic program, will provide insight into current and future therapies for multiple components
of the metabolic syndrome.",2019,334125,225000,109125,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Nutrition; Obesity,Kirk Michael Habegger

5R01HL132989-04,Resolution of Inflammation in Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction,"Heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Identifying
the events that limit adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) post-MI will provide therapeutic targets to
prevent, slow, or reverse progression to HF. MI initiates the â€œget-inâ€ signal for immune cells including
neutrophils, which if unchecked causes uncontrolled pro-inflammatory activity that in turn leads to HF. Our
post-MI studies suggest that spleen coordinates the resolution of inflammation through a cardiosplenic
pathway. These findings reveal an urgent clinical need to establish the mechanisms by which the spleen
mediates this resolution. It was previously believed that resolution of inflammation is an inert process, but
emerging data confirms that this is an active process managed by specialized pro-resolving molecules (SPMs)
derived from omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Our R00 study in an HF setting confirms that the spleen
produces various SPMs, including lipoxins, resolvins, and maresins post-MI, and exogenous treatment with
resolvin D1 (RvD1) clears inflammation in a cardiosplenic manner. We discovered that exogenous RvD1 clears
neutrophils and resolves inflammation by activating neutrophil-expressed formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) in
the left ventricle and spleen post-MI. This proof-of-concept study using RvD1 in mice provides the foundation
for investigation of the resolvins-mediated mechanism of action in chronic HF. These data implicate activation
of neutrophil receptors in promoting the â€œget-outâ€ signal for effective resolution of inflammation post-MI. To
achieve our overall goal of activating immune cells in the healing phase after MI, we propose to establish: 1)
the role of RvD1 in resolution of inflammation in chronic HF; 2) whether activation of this â€œget-outâ€ signal is
enough to resolve post-MI inflammation in HF using FPR2 knockout mice to abolish RvD1 action and resultant
HF; and 3) the novel mechanism of action of RvD1 on neutrophil-expressed CD10 in the cardiosplenic axis, as
suggested by our innovative in silico computational modeling. Our initial studies in mice have confirmed the
role of RvD1 in acute HF. Now, we propose a mechanistic study to extend in silico, ex vivo, and acute HF (day
5) outcomes to chronic HF (day 28), which is key for translation and to indicate survival benefit to HF patients.
Non-immunosuppressive pro-resolving therapy is an unmet medical need and has the potential to be the first
ever effective therapy to control chronic inflammation and delay HF in a cardiosplenic manner. These studies
will identify immune cell-specific novel targets for lipid mediators in a ligand-receptor-specific pathway, rather
than antibody or cytokine-specific inhibition, which will likely enhance therapeutic applications in patients with
HF within the next 5-6 years.","Relevance: Heart failure (HF) is highly prevalent after heart attack, and associates with a poor prognosis and
high economic burden. According to the 2013 statistics of the American Heart Association, more than 5 million
American adults have HF. In this project, we will test in mice with HF a new specialized bioactive molecule that
clears overactive immune cell populations after heart attack to resolve the inflammation and reduce heart
damage characteristic of this disease. Our approach is highly promising based on our preliminary work, and
may have considerable clinical implications for patients with HF.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Complementary and Integrative Health; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease,Ganesh V Halade
1R01HL144788-01A1,Lipoxygenase Signaling in Heart Failure Pathology,"Summary: Chronic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) can progress to heart failure (HF) with
excess morbidity and mortality; therefore, improvement in left ventricular (LV) function and survival after MI are
hard endpoints that provide the ultimate test of therapeutic efficacy. While multiple factors impact adverse
cardiac remodeling and HF progression, emerging studies lend credence to the concept that aberrant lipid
metabolism contributes importantly to chronic inflammation and subsequent HF. Traditionally, all lipoxygenase
(LOX)-derived lipid mediators have been considered
proinflammatory and detrimental. However, acute
inflammation is necessary for early healing; therefore, rather than inhibition of all inflammation,
the goal of
therapy should be to achieve an optimal balance between inflammation-promoting and -resolving factors. Our
data indicate that deletion of 12/15LOX in mice delays HF post-MI, improves infarct healing, and reduces LV
dysfunction and mortality
by promoting the formation of the resolving lipid mediators, cypoxins that polarize
leukocytes to a reparative phenotype.
These data suggest that 12/15LOX activity underlies non-resolving
inflammation following MI, thereby negatively impacting LV function and mortality. Our data in mice and
patients with HF suggest that an eicosanoid product of 12/15LOX-induced arachidonic acid metabolism, 12(S)-
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, delays leukocyte clearance in the post-MI heart, delaying inflammation
resolution. Which specific myeloid-leukocyte population contributes to bioactive lipid mediator generation after
MI remains unclear; our data point to a critical role for macrophages. Thus, we hypothesize that macrophage-
produced 12/15LOX is a key regulator of both inflammation-triggering and -resolving pathway(s) after MI
healing, and these must be balanced to alleviate the progression to HF. To test this hypothesis, we propose
three aims. Aim 1: Determine if 12/15LOX deficiency reduces inflammatory mediators to control overactive
inflammation in acute HF after MI (days 1 to 5), using a myeloid-specific 12/15LOX-knockout mice. Aim 2: Test
whether myeloid-specific 12/15LOX deficiency limits proinflammatory and promotes proresolving mediators
biosynthesis to promote effective healing after MI, and thereby delays the progression to chronic HF.
We will
determine the proinflammatory and proresolving mediators in the infarcted area using quantitative and imaging
mass spectrometry approaches that were
technologically unfeasible before, and determine the mechanism by
which macrophage-specific 12/15LOX balances proinflammatory and proresolving mediators. Aim 3: Establish
whether post-MI inhibition of 12/15LOX augments the biosynthesis of proresolving lipids acutely and
chronically after MI, and thereby facilitates LV healing and repair. Collectively, the proposed studies will define
the role of 12/15LOX in the
initiation, resolution, and progression
of inflammation post-MI. To accomplish this,
we have enlisted inflammation, HF, and biostatistics experts to complement our expertise in lipid signaling. The
new knowledge gained will advance the development of novel therapeutic targets/drugs to ameliorate HF.","Heart failure is the leading cause of death after a heart attack.
Chronic and unresolved inflammation

hallmark of advanced heart failure and is attributed to multiple factors, including aberrant lipid metabolism and

5R01HL137046-02,Cardiac Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Myocardial Fibrosis: Role of Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor  Signaling,"The central objective of this project is to evaluate how PDGF/PDGFR signaling, inflammatory signaling
responses modulate the functional outcomes of resident cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) in failing
hearts. Ischemic myocardial injury initiates a cascade of two self-amplifying events that intend to promote
tissue repair. The initial events are mediated by the concerted action of infiltrating pro-inflammatory immune
cells. Although, reparative initially, prolonged infiltration of activated monocyte/macrophage populations within
the injured myocardium further exaggerate inflammatory responses and delay the manifestation of wound
healing. Chronically these processes induce extracellular-matrix (ECM) remodeling by activating proliferation of
collagen producing myofibroblasts. Although multipotent in nature, MSCs often differentiate into myofibroblasts
in vivo in a number of pathologies, suggesting that tissue microenvironment influences are paramount in
guiding MSC fate. The precise role of cMSCs in the etiology and progression of ischemic HF is unknown.
More importantly, factors regulating cMSC function and differentiation in the failing hearts are not clearly
understood. During both acute myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (HF), there is increased
abundance of pro-inflammatory cardiac macrophages. More importantly, macrophage expansion in chronic HF
is accompanied by sustained activation of myofibroblasts that promote cardiac fibrosis. Platelet derived growth
factor (PDGF) is a well-recognized mediator of tissue fibrosis and angiogenesis. Like macrophages, MSCs
secrete PDGF and express PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), resulting in a PDGF-rich and PDGF-responsive
microenvironment in the failing heart. Importantly, however, whether cMSC-localized PDGF signaling, in
response to such factors as chronic inflammation and macrophage infiltration, regulates cMSC fate and
responses in HF is unknown. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that augmented cMSC-localized
PDGF signaling preferentially channels cMSCs toward a myofibroblast fate (and away from an endothelial cell
fate) in the failing heart, thereby augmenting fibrosis and reducing angiogenesis and repair. Three aims are
being proposed. Aim 1 will define the role of PDGFR signaling and macrophage interactions on the in vitro
differentiation fate of cMSCs derived from normal and failing hearts. Aim 2 will determine the in vivo role of
cMSC-localized PDGFRs on LV remodeling and function during ischemic HF. These studies will use
transgenic mice with inducible and cMSC-specific ablation of PDGFRs. Aim 3 will establish the therapeutic
efficacy of cMSC cell therapy after reperfused-MI when used in combination with PDGFR inhibition in vivo.
These studies will use the clinically approved PDGFR inhibitor imatinib mesylate (GleevacÂ®). Collectively the
proposed studies will answer critical questions relevant to HF related to both the pathophysiological import of
altered cMSC fate in myocardial fibrosis, and the potential therapeutic use of cMSCs and pharmacological
PDGFR inhibition to induce tissue repair.

5R01NS095626-05,Targeting PRMT5 in Cancer Initiating Cells as a New Therapy for Glioblastoma,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults with a median survival of 15-17 months. A major reason for the clinical outcome is the resistance of a subgroup of glioma cells to current therapies. This subpopulation, named glioma initiating cell (GIC), has stem cell like properties. Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to GIC stemness. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which methylates proteins including histone and modifies their functions, is emerging as a key stemness factor for normal and cancer stem cells. Our recent data demonstrate that expression of PRMT5 increases with malignant progression of glioma. PRMT5 downregulation significantly inhibits sphere formation of GIC. The mechanism by which PRMT5 regulates the stemness of GIC has not been defined. PRMT5 downregulation results in decreased expression of Dual Specificity Phosphatase 4 (DUSP4). Decreased DUSP4 expression also significantly inhibited sphere formation of GIC. These findings support that PRMT5-DUSP4 axis plays a critical role in maintaining the stemness of GIC. DUSP4 is dimethylated in GIC. Our preliminary data suggest that PRMT5 regulates DUSP4 expression through modulation of DUSP4 protein stability. The role and mechanism of DUSP4 in GIC stemness is completely unknown. Preliminary data suggest that DUSP4 is involved in regulation of Sox4 tyrosine phosphorylation in GIC. Importantly, de-phosphorylated Sox4 enhances the expression of Sox2, a stemness transcription factor. Our overall goal is to define the role and mechanism of PRMT5-DUSP4 axis in the pathogenesis of GBM. The central hypothesis is that the PRMT5-DUSP4 axis plays an important role in maintaining the stemness of GIC. We hypothesize that PRMT5 stabilizes DUSP4 protein by dimethylation of DUSP4, which protects DUSP4 from degradation in GIC. We further hypothesize that DUSP4 regulates the activation of Sox4, a transcription factor. DUSP4 de-phosphorylates Sox4, and de-phosphorylated Sox4 has enhanced ability to induce Sox2 expression. To test our hypothesis, the following SPECIFIC AIMs are proposed. In AIM 1, we will define the role of PRMT5-DUSP4 axis in maintaining stemness state of GIC and to determine whether Sox4 is required for the stemness state of GIC maintained by the PRMT5-DUSP4 axis. AIM 2 aims to determine the molecular mechanism for PRMT5-mediated regulation of DUSP4 and Sox4. AIM 3 aims to determine the role of PRMT5 and DUSP4 in gliomagenesis in GBM xenograft models and in human GBM. The completion of this project will define the novel role of PRMT5-DUSP4 axis in maintain the stemness of GIC and stimulate new paradigm in the pathogenesis of GBM. The findings will be helpful to evaluate the PRMT5-DUSP4 axis as a novel therapeutic target to improve treatment and prognosis in GBM patients.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain cancer with an average survival of 15 to 17 months despite aggressive treatment. Identification of novel therapeutic target is needed and will contribute to our arsenal to fight against this disease.

3K23AR068450-03S1,Skeletal Muscle in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, with a prevalence of 1% worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of RA patients suffer from loss of skeletal muscle mass, which often co-occurs with central obesity, a feature of metabolic syndrome [2]. Lower muscle mass leads to muscle weakness, a major contributor of physical impairment in patients with RA, even after multivariate adjustment for demographic and disease variables. My broad long-range goal is to understand at a mechanistic level the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities of skeletal muscle in patients with RA; and to use that knowledge to improve therapy for skeletal muscle dysfunction in RA. As a first step to achieve that goal, I hypothesize that increased lipid content in skeletal muscle contributes to insulin resistance and impaired skeletal muscle homeostasis and function in RA. I further hypothesize that treatment with pioglitazone will improve muscle function by decreasing lipid deposition in skeletal muscle, restoring the anabolic effects of insulin and attenuating inflammation. In order to test these hypotheses, I will establish a cohort of well-characterized RA subjects and non-RA controls, who will undergo assessment of physical function, body composition, disease activity, and needle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle (aim 1). In aim 2, I will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, and placebo- controlled study with pioglitazone in patients with RA who are insulin resistant to determine whether treatment of insulin resistance will improve functional characteristics, cellular and molecular responses in their skeletal muscle. Completion of the proposed research will begin to define the molecular underpinnings of impaired skeletal muscle homeostasis in RA. I will use the information gained from this cohort to design clinical interventions in this patient population to prevent and/or treat skeletal muscle dysfunction in RA.
Ultimately, this work promises to provide novel targets to treat and prevent a devastating complication of RA.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), nearly two-thirds of patients suffer from loss of skeletal muscle mass; and muscle weakness is a major contributor to physical impairment. Insulin resistance is implicated in the loss of muscle mass in type 2 diabetes and aging, but in patients with RA, the degree with which insulin resistance and associated lipid deposition in skeletal muscle contribute to muscle dysfunction is not known. The goals of this project are to determine the effects of insulin resistance and associated lipid deposition on RA skeletal muscle; and to elucidated if pioglitazone therapy, directed at insulin resistance and lipid deposition in skeletal muscle, can improve muscle dysfunction in patients with RA.",2019,1000,926,74,Other Research-Related,K23,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Arthritis; Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diabetes; Obesity; Rheumatoid Arthritis,Beatriz  Hanaoka

The Community Engagement Core (CEC) purpose is to develop an education delivery format that promotes
inclusivity and awareness with the general aim of increasing research participation and retention of local
citizens through collaborations between community residents and the RCMI faculty. Our population in the
Tuskegee/Macon County area is primarily low income and African American, a group that reports high rates of
distrust in scientific exploration and in healthcare delivery. We hypothesize that residents connect with
research by understanding how scientific outcomes affect them. Therefore, in our Specific Aims, we are
proposing an education dissemination strategy that begins at the community-level. The specific aims include
the following: Specific Aim 1: Convene a council of community representatives and RCMI faculty to complete a
needs assessment containing community-based recommendations for dissemination of effective obesity and
HIV education. Specific Aim 2: Engage residents in town hall meetings serving as a medium for dissemination
of faculty research. Measure the effectiveness of these meetings through surveys. Compare survey outcomes.
Specific Aim 3: Develop a model of optimal participation based on the scientific assessment of town hall
meetings. Specific Aim 4: Promote community-engaged, interdisciplinary learning and mentorship. To facilitate
the aims, our research will leverage the organizational resources of local community foundations and human
capital resources from Tuskegee University. We will also empower a group of Health Equity Resource Officers

Candidate: I am an NIH T32 Postdoctoral Fellow within the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies and
the UNC Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders in the Departments of Pharmacology and
Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Career Goals: My ultimate goal is to understand the neural circuits that regulate palatable food intake
that contribute to diseases like obesity and binge eating disorder. By researching the underlying
signaling pathways and molecular circuitry in these neurochemically defined neuron ensembles, I will
develop targeted, novel preclinical treatments for obesity and binge eating disorder for testing in
construct valid animal models of obesity and binge eating disorder.
Career Development: My current expertise is in molecular neuroscience and genetics, so I hope to
gain additional mentored training in 1) circuit neuroscience including photometry, advanced
optogenetics, chemogenetics, and electrophysiology; 2) mouse operant behavior; and 3) clinical
obesity phenotypes and metabolism within the current proposal.
Research Project: This project leverages preliminary data that shows a specific role for
prepronociceptin-expressing neurons in the central amygdala (PnocCeA neurons) in: promoting
palatable food intake, modulating the severity of diet-induced obesity, and promoting reward through
its inputs to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). I aim to 1)
measure the dynamic activity state of PnocCeA neurons during operant palatable food intake using in
vivo fiber photometry, 2) determine the role of nociceptin signaling in the PBN and NTS on neural
activity and the requisite role of this pathway in operant palatable food intake, and 3) use pathway-
specific inhibitory optogenetics and chemogenetics to probe the specific role of the PnocCeA pathway
to the PBN and NTS during operant palatable food intake. In future independent applications (R01s), I
will assess circuit and molecular plasticity of PnocCeA networks following chronic palatable food
access and diet-induced obesity.
Environment: Research will be primarily performed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
with some experiments performed at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
research program at Research Triangle Park in Durham, NC.
Mentorship: The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Thomas Kash, lead mentor, who is a leading
researcher in circuit neuroscience and consummatory behavior, and Dr. Cynthia Bulik, co-lead
mentor, who is a nationally renowned expert in obesity and eating disorder research. Dr. Kari North, a
co-mentor, is a leading researcher in clinical obesity phenotyping and genetics. Dr. Joyce Besheer, a
co-mentor, is a very experienced researcher in rodent operant behavior. Dr. Guohong Cui and Dr.
Michael Krashes, both consultants, have equipment for and routinely use in vivo fiber photometry of
genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators in awake, freely-behaving mice. Dr. Todd Thiele, a consultant, is
an expert in neuropeptide signaling and local pharmacological manipulations during mouse behavior.
Together, they will provide expertise to accomplish the scientific aims, mentorship for me to complete
my training, and leadership to promote my transition to being an independent investigator.","Project Narrative
Obesity is a growing health epidemic, is mediated by a combination of environmental and biological
factors, and is driven by an excess of energy intake relative to energy expenditure. Food
consumption, particularly of energy-dense, highly palatable foods, can increase weight gain and

7K08CA190645-04,Intra-tumor Heterogeneity in Colorectal Cancer Progression and Treatment Response,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States.
Treatment depends on location and stage and often includes radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. CRC
phenotype and response to therapy vary significantly. CRCs arise in part due to the accumulation of somatic
mutations and Copy Number Variants (CNV's). No particular change has been found that fully predicts
phenotype. We and others have identified genetic sub-clones in CRC. In other tumor types, recent studies
have highlighted the potential role of genetic heterogeneity in tumor phenotype, but in CRC the role of
heterogeneity and tumor sub-clones in tumor progression and response to therapy remains unknown. Thus,
we hypothesize the following: Substantial intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity is common in primary CRCs, and
the distinct sub-clones present in a primary lesion underpin CRC biological behavior and clinical phenotype.
Distinct sub-clones in the primary lesion give rise to CRC lymph node (LN) and distant metastases. The sub-
clones present in a CRC lesion vary in their response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Three specific
aims are proposed to address the overarching hypotheses: Specific Aim 1: We will characterize the extent and
nature of genetic sub-clones in CRCs by studying somatic genetic alterations in multiple, distinct geographic
regions from each tumor used in aims 2 and 3. We will use bioinformatics tools to integrate mutations and
CNV's to define genetic sub-clones within each tumor and compare sub-clones across tumors. Specific Aim 2:
To compare sub-clones in primary CRC's to those in patient-matched LN metastases in 20 patients with the
goal of defining the role of sub-clonal populations in metastatic progression. The questions we propose to
answer are these: 1. Are the sub-clones that metastasize to the LNs from the majority or minority clones in the
primary tumor? 2. Are individual LN metastasis made up of single or multiple sub-clones? 3. When there are
multiple LN metastasis in an individual patient, are they derived from the same sub-clone from the primary
tumor or multiple different sub-clones? Specific Aim 3A: To assess relationships between the sub-clones in the
tumor and the response of rectal cancer patients to pre-operative chemotherapy and radiation, by analyzing 40
matched primary rectal cancers before and after treatment. We hypothesize that some rectal cancer sub-
clones are sensitive and others resistant to chemo- and radiation therapy. Aim 3B: In parallel, we will create
xenograft models of 20 of the rectal cancers and assess whether they mimic the response to standard
chemotherapy and radiation seen in the matched patients. This proposal will utilize innovative sequencing and
bioinformatics techniques along with patient samples and clinical information. Ultimately, greater understanding
of the genetic mechanisms underlying CRC progression and response to treatment will allow novel, targeted
therapies to be proposed and tested. This project, the multidisciplinary mentorship team, and educational plan
will prepare the candidate to be a fully independent investigator in the field of colorectal cancer genetics.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

5R01NS107316-02,Mechanisms of alpha-synuclein mediated inflammation in multiple system atrophy,"Project Summary/Abstract
 MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation and aggregation of
misfolded forms of the protein alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) in oligodendrogila. In addition to neurodegeneration and
autonomic dysfunction, recent work has highlighted a key role for the immune system in the pathophysiology of
disease. In postmortem brains, Î±-syn pathology is accompanied by HLA-DR+ (MHCII) reactive microgliosis,
increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and infiltration of peripheral lymphocytes. While inflammation
has been reported in human disease and in animal models, it is currently unknown specifically what immune-
mediated mechanisms are critical to disease pathogenesis and whether targeting those mechanisms are
protective.
 Utilizing a novel viral vector that selectively overexpresses Î±-syn in oligodendrocytes (Olig001-SYN), I
have obtained preliminary data showing a robust inflammatory response including MHCII+ expression on
resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes, and entry of T cells closely modeling what has been reported in
human disease. In this proposal, I will use this newly developed Olig001-SYN model of MSA in combination
with transgenic mice and technologies to dissect the mechanisms of Î±-syn-related toxicity. Specifically, I will
dissect the role of central nervous system (CNS) resident microglia in initiating the immune response by
presenting antigen via MHCII to CNS patrolling CD4+ T cells, and the role of infiltrating monocytes and CD4 T
cells in mediating demyelination and neurodegeneration.
 Microglia act as the resident immune cells of the brain, and are the first to respond to neural insult. In
the first aim of this proposal, I will determine whether deletion of MHCII from CNS resident microglia is
protective against Î±-syn-induced monocyte and T cell invasion, inflammation, demyelination, and
neurodegeneration. In aims 2 and 3, I will determine whether blocking peripheral immune cell infiltrate using
genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibitors attenuates inflammation, demyelination, and
neurodegeneration observed in the Olig001-SYN model of MSA.
 Currently there are no available therapies that slow or halt disease progression. Long term, I hope the
results from these research studies will show where to target disease-modifying therapies in the pre-clinical
space, and will also be important for studying immune responses in other synucleinopathy disease models
including Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and atypical Parkinsonisms.","Project Narrative
Multiple system atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of
the protein alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes accompanied by inflammation and neuron loss in the brain.
The treatment and development of therapeutics is limited due to a gap in knowledge of mechanisms that

5R01AI113007-05,STAT4 regulation of effector CD4 T cells and CNS inflammation,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that afflicts over two million individuals worldwide. While the etiology of MS remains unknown, it is clear that there is a genetic predisposition for the disease. Genome-wide association studies indicate a correlation between genetic variants of numerous inflammatory genes and disease susceptibility. Most recently, a susceptibility variant within the intronic sequence of the STAT4 gene was identified. Importantly, expression of the transcription factor STAT4 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. These data signify a potentially integral role for STAT4 during the pathogenesis of MS. Currently, the mechanism by which STAT4 mediates CNS inflammation remains elusive; however our own preliminary data show that CD4 T cell intrinsic expression of STAT4 is vital for EAE. Additionally, striking data from our laboratory demonstrates that STAT4 is required for accumulation of CD4 T cells in the inflamed CNS, as well as for the full array of CD4 T cell effector functions. Interestingly, CD4 T cells lacking expression of the IL-23 receptor complex exhibit many of the same characteristics of STAT4 deficient CD4 T cells, and the earliest reports published on IL-23 documented that it induced the phosphorylation of not only STAT3, but also STAT4. STAT4 is also known to regulate expression of IL-12RÃŸ1, one component of the IL-23 receptor complex. Together, the published findings and our preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that IL-23 and STAT4 function in the same pathway in CD4 T cells during EAE, and that STAT4 governs the pathogenic signature in CD4 T cells necessary to confer encephalogenicity during CNS inflammation. To test this, we propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: To determine the impact of STAT4 expression on CD4 T cell functionality during CNS inflammation.  Aim 2: To determine the prerequisite of intrinsic STAT4 expression for CD4 T cell accumulation during CNS inflammation.  Aim 3: To determine the interplay between STAT4 signaling and the IL-23 pathway in CD4 T cells during CNS inflammation. Collectively, these studies are designed to provide new information regarding the cellular mediators of CNS inflammation during EAE and help to precisely define the properties and molecular regulators which control the development of encephalogenic CD4 T cells. Our long-term goal is elucidate the significance of STAT4 in promoting chronic inflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, in hopes that a transcriptional target will be identified which can be used for future therapeutic interventions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) afflicts an estimated 350,000 citizens in the United States, and as many as 2.1 million people worldwide. The underlying mechanisms that cause this demyelinating disease remain unknown, however it is postulated that CD4 T cells are a central component of the chronic inflammatory process that promotes MS.

1R21AI142641-01,Sialylation dependent control of CD8 T cell stemness during chronic viral infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During chronic infections such as those caused by HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), as well as during tumor outgrowth, antigen-specific CD8 T cells often
progressively lose function in a step-wise manner. Understanding the factors that impact CD8 T cell
responses during chronic viral infections is necessary for the design of effective immunotherapeutic strategies.
Recent reports demonstrate that a discrete subset of exhausted CD8 T cells exists that displays stem cell-like
properties, including the ability to self-renew and further differentiate in vivo. Importantly, this subset of cells is
exquisitely responsive to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy during chronic LCMV clone 13 infection. Hence,
determining the mechanisms that promote the maintenance and survival of stem-like CD8 T cells during
chronic viral infection is of central importance. We present preliminary findings that show a distinct fraction of
the virus-specific stem-like CD8 T cells express cell surface N-glycans with Î±-2,6 linked sialic acids, a
posttranslational modification mediated by the glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I. Importantly, published studies, as
well as our own data, establish that this enzyme is associated with pluripotency and stemness. Together,
these data lead us to hypothesize that ST6Gal-I sialylation positively regulates CD8 T cell stemness and
responsiveness to immunotherapy during chronic viral infection. Our objectives of this exploratory R21
application are to:
 Aim 1. Determine if ST6Gal-I sialylation identifies stem-like CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection.
 Aim 2: Determine how modulation of ST6Gal-I sialylation impacts CD8 T cell stemness.
Collectively, these studies are designed to provide new information regarding the impact of cell surface
sialylation of CD8 T cell responses, including CD8 T cell stemness and exhaustion.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chronic viral infections are associated with the emergence of exhausted CD8 T cells and targeted
interventions aimed at reinvigorating these dysfunctional responses show promise in respect to viral control. By

5K08HL140190-02,Overcoming barriers to F508del CFTR correction,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common fatal pediatric respiratory diseases, affecting approximately
1 in 3500 children. The development of CFTR modulators has spawned a new era of hope for CF therapeutics.
However, addressing the common F508del CFTR mutation has been challenging and CFTR modulator therapy
for this mutation is only minimally effective. An improved understanding of F508del CFTR and its correction is
the most critical therapeutic pursuit for CF patients.
 I have recently shown that the cystic fibrosis genetic modifier TGF-Î² diminishes CFTR function, reduces
CFTR synthesis, and impedes F508del correction. I have also reported that TGF-Î² is significantly increased in
CF lungs and mediates its effects by microRNA-based signaling. Specifically, I have found that the microRNA
145 (miR-145) mediates TGF-Î² inhibition of CFTR expression and function, and also limits F508del correction
by CFTR modulators. Discovery of this important underlying mechanism has stimulated me to expand my
career goals to microRNA therapeutics. My central hypothesis is that miR-145 antagonism interrupts TGF-Î²
suppression of CFTR synthesis and function in airway epithelia, representing an attractive therapeutic target.
With K08 support, I will receive training to 1) investigate mechanisms of miRNA regulation of CFTR 2) deliver
miRNA antagonists in vivo and 3) learn methods to quantify F508del therapeutic response in CF animal
models. These training goals will help advance my career focus on microRNA therapy and will be achieved
through the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the in vitro mechanism of miR-145 inhibition of CFTR in airway epithelia.
Specific Aim 2: Establish in vivo relevance of miR-145 manipulation to improve CFTR function.
Specific Aim 3: Augment CFTR correction with miR-145 antagonists in preclinical CF animal models.
 My training will be mentored by Dr. Steven Rowe (Director of the UAB Cystic Fibrosis Research Center and
expert in CF translational science) and a panel of senior investigators in a fertile research environment with
exceptional resources. Data obtained during the study period will establish the role of miR-145 inhibition to
stabilize F508del modulation and introduce miRNA antagonists as a useful adjunct to CFTR directed
therapeutics. Training provided by the K08 mechanism will facilitate my transition to research independence,
creating a niche to investigate consequence of miRNA dysregulation in CF lungs and benefit of miR-145
antagonists to improve current and next generation F508del CFTR correction. These studies will establish a
foundation for my career in CF translational science evaluating mechanisms of disease progression and
therapeutic development.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R03HL148467-01,Oligotherapeutics to enhance CFTR correction,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a fatal lung disease that affects 1 in 3500 children. F508del CFTR,
the most common mutation present in 90% of CF patients, has proven difficult to treat. The two
FDA approved drugs, OrkambiÂ® (lumacaftor and ivacaftor) and SymdekoÂ® (tezacaftor and
ivacaftor), only improve lung function by 2-4%. Improving F508del CFTR remains a critical
unmet need in CF therapeutics.
 One barrier to F508del CFTR correction is increased expression of the genetic modifier
TGF-Î² in CF lung and airway epithelia. TGF-Î² suppresses CFTR function and nullifies the
benefit of OrkambiÂ® and SymdekoÂ®. Our laboratory has discovered that the microRNA miR-145
mediates TGF-Î² inhibition of CFTR correction. TGF-Î² increases miR-145 which directly binds to
the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) to degrade CFTR transcripts and diminish protein
expression. Loss of CFTR substrate eliminates therapeutic response. miR-145 antagonism
overcomes this barrier to improve OrkambiÂ® benefit.
 The project pursues a novel approach to augment F508del therapeutics. We will utilize an
antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to block miR-145 binding to CFTR. We hypothesize that ASO-
directed miR-145 target site blockade improves F508del CFTR correction.
Specific Aim #1: To selectively augment F508del CFTR correction through antisense
oligonucleotide blockade of the miR-145 binding site.
Specific Aim #2: To test in vivo delivery, safety, and efficacy of antisense oligonucleotide
miRNA target specific blockade in humanized CFTR mice.
 These Aims will provide the necessary â€œnext stepsâ€ in oligotherapeutic development. Aim 1
provides the in vitro mechanism, dosing, and efficacy data to establish the rationale for
oligonucleotide targeting of the miRNA binding site to improve F508del CFTR correction. Aim 2
utilizes the recently developed full-length humanized CFTR mouse to establish delivery

5R01AR069578-04,An Epigenetic Axis in Bone Formation,"Abstract
An Epigenetic Axis in Bone Formation
As over 53 million adults in the United States have low bone mass due to arthritis and osteoporosis, novel
therapeutic strategies that protect from progressive and chronic bone loss are clearly warranted. The purpose of
the proposed research is to refine our central hypothesis, based on my previous research, the miR-23a cluster
controls bone synthesis and homeostasis by regulating Runx2-dependent Ezh2 expression. Current studies do
not have any insight on how epigenetic repression by histone methylation of bone specific chromatin is
maintaining bone mass in vivo. Understanding of this gap is pivotal for further studies to identify specific targets
for future therapies, which protect against bone loss. In our previous work we found that miR-23a cluster
represses Runx2 expression, inhibits osteoblast specific genes, and finally blocks osteoblast differentiation in
vitro. However, the inhibitory role of miR-23a cluster during the development and remodeling of bone and the
chromatin repression mechanism, leading to this inhibition of essential genes required for bone formation, is
unrevealed. To address the above queries in vivo for this bone-regulating miRNA cluster, we created an inducible
anti-miR-23a cluster (miR-23aClZIP) knockdown mouse model. Interestingly, our miR-23a cluster knockdown mice
developed high cortical and trabecular bone. RNA sequencing from these mice displayed an increased
expression of Runx2, the master transcription factor essential for skeletogenesis, and decreased expression
of Ezh2, a chromatin repressor also vital for skeletogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that Runx2 decreased
the repressive activity of Ezh2 to the promoters of bone essential genes for osteogenesis. Together, our findings
strongly suggest that miR-23a cluster connection with a tissue specific RUNX2â€“EZH2 function is a very unique
regulatory mechanism. Thus, this mechanism will be key to the genetic basis of bone development, growth and
maintenance further. However, additional research is needed to clarify 1) bone phenotype of miR-
23aClZIP mouse during development and maintenance; 2) compositions of the EZH2 led PRC2 methylation
complex and their recruitment; finally, 3) histone modifications and mechanisms that led to enhanced bone
formation. We will refine our central hypothesis by testing two hypotheses derived from the central hypothesis
and stated in the Specific Aims below. Together these specific aims will address the unresolved issues outlined
above. Specific Aim 1. In vivo inhibition of miR-23a cluster enhances bone synthesis and remodeling. Specific
Aim 2. In vivo inhibition of miR-23a cluster decreases EZH2 controlled methylation and modifications of bone
gene promoters. Exploring our novel mouse model with cutting edge in vivo and in vitro molecular tools, we will
accomplish the above specific aims, and later translate these results into osteoporotic and osteopenic bone loss
models, to block this repressive state of chromatin and protect from such bone loss. This is how our current study
will remove a barrier to progress the bone field.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01HL129878-04,Neutrophil dysregulation as a driving mechanism of cardiovascular disease in HIV-1-infection,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT.
 HIV infection conveys a 1.5 â€“ 2 fold increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases
(CVD). HIV-1-infected individuals are disproportionately impacted by CVD with increased carotid artery intima-
medial thickening, subclinical coronary artery atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and
silent ischemic heart disease compared to uninfected controls. CVD and other chronic diseases are
increasingly replacing AIDS-related complications as the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in
ART-treated patients. There is a widespread consensus that chronic inflammation resulting from microbial
translocation, persisting despite successful virological control, is responsible for this excess risk. However, the
specific mechanisms and mediators of this process are not well understood.
 Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocyte population, have recently emerged as critical contributors
to atherosclerosis and thrombotic disorders. Following activation, a subset of neutrophils undergoes a specific
type of cell death referred to as NETosis characterized by a release of large extracellular neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs) composed of chromosomal DNA and neutrophil granular proteins. These NETs
provide the stimulus and the scaffold for thrombus formation and prime macrophages for production of
cytokines that amplify immune cell recruitment in atherosclerotic plaques. We have demonstrated that
neutrophils from HIV-1-infected individuals display an activated phenotype, specific transcriptional profile,
increased rate of degranulation, and a high capacity to undergo NETosis. The accumulated evidence strongly
suggests that neutrophils undergoing NETosis accelerate CVD progression in HIV-1 infection. The overall
objectives of this proposal are to: 1) define the role of activated neutrophils and NETosis as driving
mechanisms of CVD in HIV-1-infected individuals, and 2) identify the mechanisms responsible for chronic
neutrophilic activation in HIV-1-infected individuals in order to reveal specific checkpoints for intervention. Our
central hypothesis is that chronic inflammation in intestinal mucosal tissue of HIV-1-infected individuals results
in a release of factors inducing neutrophil activation and accelerated recruitment from bone marrow. The
emerging neutrophil population has higher capacity to undergo NETosis following activation by bacterial
products leaking across the damaged intestinal barrier. NETs released from activated neutrophils promote the
progression of vascular dysfunction in HIV-1 infection. The overall objectives will be accomplished in three
specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which neutrophil activation and NETosis predict the progression of
vascular dysfunction in HIV-1-infected individuals; 2) Define the mechanisms of chronic systemic neutrophil
activation in HIV-1 infection; and 3) Define the neutrophil-based prognostic markers that are associated with
vascular disease-related morbid events in HIV-1-infection.
 We expect that the proposed project will fundamentally advance our understanding of primary
mechanisms of inflammation-driven vascular disease in HIV-1 infection. The definition of mechanisms driving
the progression of vascular diseases in HIV-1-infected individuals will have significant translational impact and
serve as a basis for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","8. NARRATIVE

5R01DK108353-05,The Guts of HIV: Innate Immune Dysregulation as a Central Mechanism of Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease in HIV-1-infected Individuals,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease (LD) has risen as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-1-infected individuals. A growing body of evidence suggests that HIV-1 alters and accelerates the pathologic processes driving LD via systemic inflammation; however, the role of neutrophils and innate immune dysregulation in these processes has not been evaluated. This application proposes that innate immune dysregulation mediated by changes in macrophage and neutrophil populations in gut- associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and liver plays a fundamental role in HIV-1 disease progression. Neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell population in the body, are specifically geared for a sensitive detection of invading microbial and viral pathogens. GALT epithelial damage in both HIV-1 and SIV infections is temporally and spatially associated with a significant accumulation of neutrophils that directly contribute to mucosal damage. IL-17 serves as a master regulator of neutrophil function and, in conjunction with IL-10, it is required for an induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages that clear apoptotic neutrophilic infiltrates via efferocytosis and promote healing and resolution of local and systemic inflammation. The first underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that the depletion of IL-17-producing cells in the GALT of HIV-1-infected individuals blocks the induction of anti-inflammatory efferocytic tissue macrophages and causes polarization towards pro-inflammatory phenotype. This results in an accumulation of activated neutrophils that undergo NETosis and drive tissue damage in intestinal mucosa. Factors released as a result of ongoing GALT inflammation induce systemic recruitment of a population of activated neutrophils with specific phenotype, expression profile, and high capacity for NETosis. The second principal hypothesis is that HIV-1 infection is associated with a significantly decreased frequency of Kupffer cells (KCs) exhibiting anti-inflammatory phenotype and a significant shift towards blood monocyte-derived proinflammatory KCs. This state is not reversed following ART, possibly due to the depletion of self-renewing tissue-resident KC progenitors. Activated neutrophils interact with Kupffer cells and platelet and undergo NETosis in liver microvasculature. In the course of HIV-1 infection, this mechanism causes chronic liver inflammation, portal hypertension, activation of hepatic stellate cells, and results in a progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. Thus, we propose that two simultaneous hits to innate immune populations in primary and secondary mucosal firewalls, the GALT and the liver, drive disease progression in HIV-1/AIDS. We propose to determine the effect of neutrophil activation and innate immune dysregulation in GALT and liver on the progression of LD in ART- treated HIV-1-infected individuals. Importantly, since functional dysregulation of neutrophil population and neutrophil-macrophage interaction can be pharmacologically targeted, understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms will lead to novel treatment approaches in HIV-1 infection and other chronic inflammatory conditions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

1R01DA045186-01A1,Early Withdrawal Exposure and Negative Affect Withdrawal (NAW) Regulation Training for Smoking Cessation,"Cigarette smoking remains the single most preventable cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States.
Long-term abstinence rates for even the most rigorous of smoking cessation treatments range between 20%
and 35%. It is therefore essential that research continue to investigate novel smoking cessation interventions.
Leading contemporary theories of addiction motivation posit that the escape or avoidance of negative affect
withdrawal (NAW) symptoms (e.g., anger, anxiety, and depression/sadness) constitutes a strong motivational
basis for cigarette smoking and plays a critical role in relapse to cigarette use. However, whereas NAW
symptoms appear to exert a powerful influence on smoking cessation treatment outcome, smoking cessation
interventions may exert only modest effects on NAW symptoms. Accordingly, it has been proposed that
smoking cessation interventions may be augmented by aiding smokers in the practice of NAW regulation
strategies. The primary goal of this investigation is to evaluate an early withdrawal exposure plus NAW
regulation training intervention for smoking cessation. Specific aims include evaluating the efficacy of the
treatment components and investigating potential mediators and moderators of the treatment components.
Participants will be adult smokers (N = 400) of at least 5 cigarettes per day with the intention to quit smoking.
Using a factorial design, participants will be randomized to early withdrawal exposure (yes vs. no) and
behavioral intervention (NAW regulation training vs. relaxation control training), resulting in four distinct
conditions. Our primary hypothesis is that early withdrawal exposure plus NAW regulation training will produce
higher rates of seven-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 3, and 6 months after end-of-treatment, suggesting
a synergistic (i.e., non-additive) effect of the two intervention components. Mediators (e.g., in-session
withdrawal symptoms) and moderators (e.g., demographic characteristics, tobacco dependence) will be
investigated via established analyses. These data will advance the experimental intervention with a focus on
targeting mechanisms of change as well as participant characteristics to which the intervention may be
tailored. The experimental intervention described in the current proposal has the potential to ultimately
enhance the efficacy of existing smoking cessation interventions and will therefore contribute uniquely to the
field.","Smoking remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting
for approximately half a million deaths every year. The current study will investigate the efficacy and

5R01DA036027-05,The Time Course and Clinical Significance of Early E-cigarette Withdrawal Effects,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): E-cigarettes are quickly becoming the most commonly used inhaled tobacco product in the U.S. after tobacco cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes may pose a threat to the public health, more research on these products is needed to inform and guide FDA regulation. Indeed, no data exist on the time course or clinical significance of e-cigarette withdrawal, and therefore a complete understanding of the addictive nature of these products is unknown. As the first of any empirical study to focus on e-cigarette withdrawal effects, the objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) characterize the early time course of e-cigarette withdrawal effects; 2) evaluate the clinical significance of early e-cigarett withdrawal effects; 3) compare the time course and clinical significance of early e-cigarette withdrawal effects to the time course and clinical significance of early tobacco withdrawal effects; and 4) examine moderators of the time course and clinical significance of early e-cigarette withdrawal effects. Participants will be 150 e-cigarette users and 150 tobacco cigarette users who will participate in two counterbalanced experimental sessions involving either 4 hours of abstinence or smoking as usual. Withdrawal measures will include negative affect (Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale), physical symptoms (Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale), multifaceted craving (Tobacco Craving Questionnaire), anhedonia (Tripartite Pleasure Inventory), perceived reinforcement value of smoking (Cigarette Choice Procedure), and open-ended report. After baseline assessment, withdrawal measures will be administered every 30 minutes. At the conclusion of the 4-hour period, participants will complete the Behavioral Smoking Lapse Analogue Task, a clinically relevant analogue task of smoking lapse that measures the ability to resist the temptation to smoke under conditions in which it is advantageous to remain abstinent. Candidate moderator variables assessed at intake will include demographic characteristics, e-cigarette history and use characteristics, smoking dependence, thoughts about abstinence, abstinence-related expectancies, and intolerance for smoking abstinence discomfort. Analyses will evaluate e-cigarette withdrawal effect differences between abstinent and non-abstinent experimental sessions, test the relationships between e-cigarette withdrawal effects and performance on the Behavioral Smoking Lapse Analogue Task, determine if withdrawal effects and their relationships to performance on the Behavioral Smoking Lapse Analogue Task differ between e-cigarette users and tobacco cigarette users, and evaluate whether e-cigarette withdrawal effects and their relationships to performance on the Behavioral Smoking Lapse Analogue Task differ across levels of the candidate moderator variables. In conclusion, the proposed study will facilitate FDA regulation of e-cigarettes by informing the addictive nature of these products and determining those populations that may be especially vulnerable to e- cigarette addiction.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are appropriate targets for FDA regulation, but additional research is needed to inform regulatory action.

5R01AG054719-03,Targeting Rho Kinases for Alzheimer's disease Therapeutics,"Project Summary
Current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies predominantly focus on amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides, but biomarker
studies indicate that AÎ² effects may be maximal before onset of clinical symptoms. Downstream of AÎ²,
synapse loss and intracellular accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau correlate strongly with
cognitive decline, yet few therapeutic strategies target these mechanisms. Presently, twenty-nine kinase
inhibitors are used to treat human diseases, and out of these, two are pan- Rho-associated protein kinases
(ROCK) 1 and 2 inhibitors. In the mid-2000s, the ROCKs were identified as putative translational targets to
curb AÎ² production. However, progress on this exciting avenue languished due to three critical barriers: 1) the
lack of connection between ROCKs and AD pathogenesis beyond mechanisms tied to AÎ² generation, 2) the
lack of genetic models to test the role of ROCK1 or ROCK2 in AD mice, and 3) the lack of kinase inhibitors
offering high ROCK-selectivity and brain penetrance. We aim to overcome these barriers with new data linking
ROCKs to structural plasticity changes in AD progression and employing new ROCK1 and ROCK2 conditional
knockout mice as well as novel pan- and isoform-selective ROCK inhibitors that exhibit high bioavailability and
brain penetrance with no gross side-effects. In Aim 1, we will address the contribution of ROCK1 and ROCK2
to AÎ²-induced dendritic structure degeneration. In Aim 2, we will test the effects of chronic ROCK inhibition in
mouse models of AD, and in Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which ROCK1 and ROCK2 mediate
tau protein homeostasis and autophagy induction.","Project Narrative

5R01AG061800-02,Identifying therapeutic targets that confer synaptic resilience to Alzheimer's disease,"Project Summary
Approximately 30%-50% of individuals who come to autopsy without dementia have high levels of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) pathology. Even in the AD population, the cellular feature most correlated with cognitive decline
is not amyloid or tau, but synaptic density. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this synaptic loss are
unclear. We have begun to explore their molecular basis through three dimensional (3D) modeling of dendritic
spines. These results show that structural remodeling of spines not only relates to cognitive decline, but
specifically relates to cognitive resilience to AD. Synaptic remodeling is highly plausible as the basis for
cognitive resilience because it is the basis for short term memory and can affect multiple cognitive processes.
This raises important questions: 1) what are the synaptic signaling pathways that drive structural remodeling of
spines to maintain cognitive abilities in resilient individuals? 2) Can we identify therapeutic targets for drug
repositioning or novel treatments to exploit these mechanisms in at risk patients? The goal of this proposal is to
build a predictive model of cognitive resilience to AD by integrating quantitative proteomics, phospho-
proteomics, 3D modeling of spines, and antemortem functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) across two
brain regions from the same individuals. From computational models, candidate therapeutic protein targets will
be prioritized and rigorously validated in cellular and animal models of AD. Novel data acquired to support this
goal will measure ~12,000 proteins and ~30,000 phosphorylation sites in synapse-rich fractions from human
brains with varying degrees of resilience to AD pathology. In the same cases innovative high resolution
imaging and 3D reconstruction of dendritic architecture will measure cellular phenotypes of resilience. Systems
biology approaches will integrate our data with existing omics, including AMP-AD, and propose specific
synaptic proteins that drive resilience. These predictions will be validated in terms of human brain structure and
function by comparison to neuroimaging, acquired in the same set of humans. Top candidates for resilience
will then be screened for resilience phenotypes in cellular and animal models of disease. Human clinical,
radiologic, and pathologic data, from The Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project will
be studied in combination with AMP-AD data to complete the proposed goals.","Project Narrative

5K01HL130609-04,Epigenomics of Cardiometabolic Diseases in Mexican Americans,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) is known as the collective impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension (HTN), and obesity, and is one of the biggest health challenges facing the world today. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine or adenine nucleotides, varies with aging and with environmental exposures, and is a critical epigenetic mediator of gene expression. CMS has a variety of local and systemic manifestations, all of which are likely impacted by a combination of genetic, genomic, and epigenetic pathways. We hypothesize that characterization of gene-specific DNA methylation marks will provide important insights into the factors contributing to CMS. We also hypothesize that characterizing DNA methylation marks correlated with ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP variants may provide important insights into the regulation of these key cardiometabolic genes, previously determined to be important in CMS. Thus, the broad goals of this project include three specific aims to be carried out in the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS) cohort of 600 Mexican Americans: 1) To determine the association of quantitative methylation data from ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP at baseline with prevalent diabetes-, hypertension-, and obesity-related phenotypes; 2) To determine the association of quantitative methylation data from ABCG1, CPT1A, and TXNIP at baseline with progression to diabetes, hypertension, and obesity over four study visits; and 3) To integrate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation, methylation marks, and gene expression data to define the most comprehensive causal model of CMS. The expected outcome of the proposed research and training is preliminary data to inform the design of a larger study led by the applicant to assess racial/ethnic variation in the epigenetics of CMS. In summary, this Mentored Career Development Award will foster the candidate's professional development as an independent scientist by providing an opportunity to gain expertise in epigenomics, health disparities, and statistical genetics.

a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in cancer and bone genetics and biology. This K01 award will facilitate my
transition into an independent position as a tenure-track clinician-scientist studying bone metastasis and primary
bone tumors. My clinical and research training will benefit both human and veterinary clinicians and researchers
and promote the development of essential translational and comparative collaborations. Advancement towards
independence will occur by many mechanisms during this K01 award. I will obtain knowledge and skills central
to this awardâ€™s research strategy and my career goals. I will continue to hone previously learned techniques but
also receive training in new methods to study cancer biology and genetics, the tumor microenvironment, bone
biology, and metastasis. I will receive training in essential non-laboratory research skills such as grantsmanship,
scientific writing, responsible conduct of research, and mentoring. Metastatic disease is the leading cause of
breast cancer-related deaths and bone metastases occur in ~75% of patients with metastasis. In bone, cancer
cells secrete factors that 1) stimulate macrophages (MPs) to differentiate into osteoclasts (OCs) and 2) increase
osteoclastic bone resorption (lysis), leading to bone loss, pain, and fracture. Therefore, preventing the
establishment of and treating existing bone metastasis is the goal of therapy. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSF1R) regulates the expression of the transcription factor (TF) PU.1. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
the CSF1R/PU.1 axis is a key regulator of 1) tumor-associated MP (TAM) function and 2) normal MP and OC
differentiation and function. In addition, several TFs and genes essential for OC differentiation and function have
a strong enhancer binding pattern by PU.1 resembling â€œsuperenhancersâ€. These enhancers are enriched for BET
proteins which bind to PU.1 to regulate key osteoclastogenic TFs. The objective of this award is to 1) investigate
the role of the CSF1R/PU.1 axis and 2) determine if superenhancers play a role, in breast cancer bone
metastasis. Our hypothesis is that the CSF1R/PU.1 axis is essential for bone metastasis and this occurs in the
context of superenhancers. We will initially assess the effects of MP-specific deletion of PU.1 on breast cancer
bone metastasis and determine genes regulated by PU.1 in both primary tumor MPs and bone metastasis MPs
and OCs (Aim 1). We will then evaluate if BET inhibition can reduce the development of, and growth of
established, bone metastasis and determine if increasing its specificity to specifically target MPs and OCs will
increase its therapeutic efficacy (Aim 2). Lastly, we will evaluate if combination therapy with the most efficacious
BET inhibitor preparation from Aim 2 and a CSF1R inhibitor targeting the CSF1R/PU.1 axis is more efficacious
against the development and growth of bone metastasis when compared to either agent alone (Aims 3 and 4A-
B). Findings could have a major impact on treatment, quality of life, and survival of bone metastasis patients.","Project Narrative:
Once breast cancer cells spread to bone they increase the activity of cells called osteoclasts, which are formed
from cells called macrophages, leading to bone loss, pain, and fracture. A cell surface receptor on macrophages
and osteoclasts called CSF1R increases the activity of a protein called PU.1, which then works with a family of
proteins called BETs to increase osteoclast activity. We will determine if inhibiting 1) the communication between
CSF1R and PU.1 and/or 2) BET proteins can prevent the development of, and growth of existing, breast cancer
bone metastasis.",2019,126738,117350,9388,Other Research-Related,K01,NIH Office of the Director,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Breast Cancer; Cancer; Genetics; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases,Blake Eason Hildreth
5IK2RX001824-04,Optimizing Dementia Care Through Collaborative Recovery Interventions,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION:    
Dementia affects over 7% of veterans age 65 and above seeking care through the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), amounting to one out of every eleven veterans in some VISNs. The unique functional and behavioral impairments associated with Alzheimer's or a related dementia (ADRD) contribute substantially to psychological and physical morbidity of family caregivers and high rates of nursing home placement, with 60% of ADRD caregivers rating the emotional stress of caregiving as ""high or very high,"" and over one third reporting depressive symptoms. Although numerous evidence-based interventions have been developed to reduce caregiver burden and improve mental health and functional outcomes of the person with dementia, a recent systematic review noted almost none of these interventions ""make it off of the shelf"" to be readily available in clinical settings.    
   
Care Consultation (CC) has emerged as a rare exception. CC is an evidence-based telephone intervention delivering psychoeducation, care coordination, and resource referrals in diverse areas such as safety and mental and behavioral health support. Yet CC's focus on coaching and support is inadequate for dyads experiencing high levels of distress. A stepped- intervention approach would address the VA's efficiency needs while allowing the flexibility for more resource-intensive additional counseling beyond the established CC framework when warranted by high dyad distress. This CDA-2 proposal would move such a dyadic intervention forward. Objectives: 1) Manualize the integration of care consultation and counseling components (i.e., the CC+C intervention). CC+C is guided by a rehabilitation recovery-based conceptual model to address the most common high distress targets (e.g., relationship distress, veteran or caregiver depression, anxiety, or pain) using patient-centered approaches. 2) Evaluate preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CC+C Intervention in a randomized controlled pilot study of distressed dyads to compare: a) the established CC intervention, to b) the CC+C intervention on veteran and caregiver outcomes. 3) Conduct exploratory analyses of the CC+C intervention on veteran long-term care placement at six and 12 months and examine two key treatment moderators (behavioral symptoms and spousal relationship status) that may impact intervention engagement and response to treatment.    
   
Methods: Ten modules combining successful elements from existing manualized therapies and exercises developed by the investigative team during the CDA-1 period will be integrated with CC into a draft CC+C intervention manual. The manual will be finalized with input from the mentoring team and an Expert Advisory Panel for completeness, feasibility, and safety and risk considerations. Next 68 distressed veterans with dementia and their family caregivers will be recruited and randomized to either the CC+C intervention group or the CC comparison group. Patient, caregiver, and relationship outcomes (e.g., burden, depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, relationship distress) will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment implementation and feasibility data will be collected. Anticipated Impacts: The goal of this career development proposal is to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to successfully compete for an RR&D Merit Review Award evaluating a randomized controlled trial powered to establish efficacy and test effectiveness of the CC+C intervention. Rehabilitation- focused interventions that maximize functioning are essential for successful non-institutional VA dementia care in the future. Work completed during the CDA-2 period will serve as a foundation for a career committed to this goal. The impact of this work will be realized when an efficacious and highly-accessible rehabilitation intervention, such as the telephone-based dyadic intervention being piloted, becomes available for aging veterans and their families.  

   
","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    
More individuals with dementia will seek services from the VA over the next 10 years than at any point in our nations' history. Yet critical gaps remain in the Veteran's Health Administration' (VHA) dementia care plans. Research is needed on the best way to get rehabilitation-focused, sustained, evidence-based care to community-dwelling aging veterans and their families. Remote delivery of care via telehealth is one answer that ensures resources are available for those with diminished access to specialty health care resources due to disease burden or transportation barriers. This application describes two important contributions: 1) the manual development and an initial randomized controlled pilot study of a telephone-based counseling and care consultation intervention for veterans with dementia and their family caregivers; and 2) the training plan that will prepare Michelle Hilgeman, Ph.D., for a career devoted to developing and translating dyadic interventions that optimize recovery-focused outcomes for veterans with dementia and their caregivers.

Enhancements to the Enrichment Program of the UAB Nutrition Obesity Research Center are proposed to
support the overall aims of this revision application. The overall goal of the revision application is to enhance the
UAB NORCâ€™s capacity to directly contribute to research and activities with the potential to reduce the high rates
of chronic diseases in the Southeastern U.S. Enrichment activities will identify, support, and disseminate
research germane to personalized approaches to weight management and lifestyle modification to help reduce
the burden of chronic diseases throughout communities in Southeastern U.S. The enhancements to the
enrichment program will support each of three specific aims. Specific aim #1 - To enhance the capacity of the
UAB NORC to develop evidence-based personalized approaches for modifying diet and exercise using
multilevel behavior change strategies â€“ will be supported by targeting individuals with expertise in
personalized approaches to lifestyle modification in our seminar series and developing workshops and
roundtables to facilitate development of multidisciplinary research teams to address personalized approaches to
lifestyle modification. Specific aim #2 - To evaluate evidence-based personalized strategies for modifying
diet and exercise behaviors to treat obesity by conducting pragmatic research and treating patients
within a new Lifestyle Medicine Clinic â€“ will be supported by developing educational and training materials
aimed at primary healthcare providers. Specific aim #3 - To disseminate and implement best practices for
modifying diet and exercise behaviors for obesity treatment to clinical and community settings
throughout the Southeastern U.S. â€“ will be supported by identifying individuals interested in reducing obesity
within existing partnerships and networks across the Southeastern U.S. and facilitating communication and
collaboration within this group. We expect that the enhanced capacities of the UAB NORC resulting from this
revision will 1) increase the NORC research base by fostering new collaborations across the UAB campus, 2)
increase the competitiveness of UAB NORC researchers for acquiring NIH and other research funding, which is
increasingly focused on personalized medicine, and 3) linking the UAB NORC with research centers with strong

3P30DK056336-18S1,UAB Nutrition Obesity Research Center - Chronic Disease and Health Disparities Revision,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Aspen Health Strategy Group recently concluded that â€œthe single most consequential step the nation could
take to reduce the burden of chronic diseases is to reduce the incidence of obesity.â€ For 17 years, the University
of Alabama at Birmingham Nutrition Obesity Research Center (UAB NORC) has been a leader in conducting
research to prevent and treat obesity through investigation of the causal factors underlying nutrition and obesity-
related comorbidities. However, current approaches for reducing obesity have failed to prevent the widespread
increase in the prevalence and incidence of obesity, especially within underserved communities in the
Southeastern U.S. Interventions to treat obesity are characterized by wide inter-individual variability in weight
loss success. Our central hypothesis is that interventions to treat obesity need to be personalized and account
for the complex and interacting factors that contribute the variability in weight loss. Therefore, the overall
objective of this UAB NORC revision is to enhance and build our capacity for developing personalized lifestyle
interventions (Specific Aim 1), evaluating their efficacy and effectiveness (Specific Aim 2), and disseminating
and implementing them in clinical and community settings in Birmingham and throughout the Southeastern U.S.
Specific Aim 1 will be accomplished through the integration and centralization of diet and exercise facilities and
expertise available to the UAB NORC research base, and through expanded enrichment activities to facilitate
interest in conducting research to identify personalized approaches to reduce obesity. To accomplish Specific
Aim 2, we will take advantage of a unique Lifestyle Medicine Clinic being established at UAB to use personalized
and evidence-based lifestyle approaches to treat obesity and evaluate promising new personalized approaches.
Specific Aim 3 will be accomplished through dissemination of promising research approaches to reduce obesity
in collaboration with other UAB research centers that are addressing chronic diseases and that have existing
partnerships and networks throughout the Southeastern U.S. Additionally, we will work with the Department of
Family Medicine to develop and disseminate education and training curricula in lifestyle medicine to primary
health care providers through existing primary care networks. This revision will allow the UAB NORC to work
synergistically with other UAB research centers to more directly address the high rates of chronic diseases in
the Southeastern U.S. and in underserved communities by promoting and facilitating personalized approaches
to obesity research that spans the NIH Translational Science Spectrum. We believe that such approaches are
urgently needed to finally â€œmove the needleâ€ on preventing and treating obesity and obesity-associated chronic
diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Preventing and treating obesity is the single most important requirement for reducing the burden of chronic
diseases. However, current approaches have not prevented the continued widespread rise in the prevalence of
obesity, and they are characterized by a staggering degree of variability in success at the individual level. The

5R01NS104339-02,Biosynthetic Metabolic Pathway Regulation of Glioma Growth,"ABSTRACT
Biosynthetic metabolic pathways provide the building blocks required for cell growth and generate important
cell signaling molecules, including reactive species. When dysregulated, these pathways can contribute to
brain pathologies including brain tumors. We determined that one biosynthetic pathway involving GTP
cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) as the rate-limiting step contributes to the growth of brain tumors and is elevated in
the neoplastic stem cell subpopulation. In patient sample datasets, increased levels of GCH1 also correlate
with poor outcomes. These data suggest the importance of understanding the biological and molecular roles of
GCH1. We have therefore proposed to determine if GCH1 is critical for regulating reactive species balance in
glioma and maintaining neoplastic stem cell characteristics. Potential novel downstream mediators of GCH1
effects will be validated. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of GCH1 will determine if targeting of GCH1 is
sufficient to decrease glioma growth alone or in combination with standard of care. We anticipate these studies
will determine if GCH1 or another molecule in the same biosynthetic pathway should be a further investigated
as a biomarker for either outcome or therapeutic response. We hope that our studies will provide a greater
understanding of the mechanisms through which metabolism is altered in brain disease and inform future novel
treatment strategies.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Alterations of metabolic pathways that provide building blocks required for continued growth and generate
important reactive molecules for cell signaling have significant impact on brain pathologies including brain
tumors. We have determined a metabolic pathway contributes to neoplastic stem cell growth and are seeking
to better understand this mechanism. We are using novel strategies to target metabolism in preclinical trials
and believe that our studies will provide new understanding of brain disease.

This research proposal has been developed to equip the candidate, Dr. Jessica Hoffman, with the experience,
skills, and tools needed to successfully transition into a faculty position at a large public research university. The
proposed research will discover novel metabolic mechanisms that lead to small size and long life across natural
genetic variation and lifespan extending interventions with a specific focus on the degradation of tryptophan to
kynurenine. Dr. Hoffman will receive extensive training in mouse husbandry techniques, molecular biology, and
metabolomics data acquisition and analysis under the guidance of her mentorship team, Drs. Steven Austad,
Stephen Barnes, and Liou Sun, all at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and active members of UAB's
Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in the Biology of Aging. Preliminary studies completed under the direction
of Dr. Steven Austad indicate size plays a large role in explaining the variation in metabolomic profiles within a
species (companion dogs) that show a negative correlation between body size and longevity. And work with Dr.
Sun suggests that metabolomic profiles are different between small, long-lived growth hormone (GH) disrupted
mice and wild type mice. One pathway found to be similar between the two species is the breakdown of
tryptophan to kynurenine. In both small dogs and small GH disrupted mice kynurenine levels are higher and
tryptophan levels are lower than their larger counterparts. This suggests that the degradation of tryptophan to
kynurenine may be influencing the longevity extension seen in small individuals of a species. The overall goal of
this project is to expand our knowledge of small size and long life and to further tease apart the molecular
mechanisms that underlie the size longevity tradeoff seen across species. The overarching hypothesis is that
tryptophan metabolic dysregulation is partially modulated by GH and energy intake and provides an IGF-
I independent mechanisms of long-life and small body size across species. This hypothesis will be
addressed by three specific aims, each of which will help develop Dr. Hoffman as an independent investigator.
1) Determine the dynamics of tryptophan metabolism to the longevity effect of reduced GH activity. 2) Determine
how metabolomic profiles, specifically tryptophan degradation metabolism varies across different interventions
that show smaller size and longer life across species. 3) Determine lifespan consequences of genetic
manipulation of tryptophan metabolism genes in fruit flies. Overall, this proposal will increase our knowledge on
the molecular underpinnings that lead to variation in body size and lifespan and will provide new hypotheses
about potential interventions to improve lifespan and healthspan.","Project Narrative
One repeated feature of a number of longevity-extending interventions in animal models is that they result in
reduced body size; in addition, a similar pattern in seen in natural genetic variation of wild type animals where
small mice and dogs are longer lived than their larger counterparts. One pathway that has been found to be
associated with age and body size is tryptophan metabolism to kynurenine; however, the direct of effects of
tryptophan metabolism manipulation on aging and longevity are unknown. Here, I attempt to discover the
metabolic changes that are associated with size and lifespan with specific focus on tryptophan degradation to

reduced body size; in addition, a similar pattern in seen in natural genetic variation of wild type animals where
small mice and dogs are longer lived than their larger counterparts. One pathway that has been found to be
associated with age and body size is tryptophan metabolism to kynurenine; however, the direct of effects of
tryptophan metabolism manipulation on aging and longevity are unknown. Here, I attempt to discover the

1R36HS026669-01A1,Preventing opioid overdose deaths by empowering pharmacists to dispense naloxone,"Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hohmann, Lindsey A
Abstract
 Background & Significance: Given the rising problem of prescription drug abuse & high number of
opioid-related deaths annually in the United States, mechanisms to distribute naloxone (a fast-acting opioid
reversal agent) are sorely needed. Due to extended hours & no need for appointments, community pharmacies
offer a solution. Since 2015, all 50 states have passed bills allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone to
patients without a physicianâ€™s prescription. However, pharmacists still miss opportunities to dispense naloxone
to eligible patients due to misinformation or lack of confidence in implementing naloxone services.
 Aims: The purpose of this study is to create & assess a targeted pharmacist training program for naloxone
therapy management to increase community pharmacistsâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, confidence, intention, &
naloxone dispensing activities for prevention of opioid overdose deaths. This study will use mixed methods & a
2-group pragmatic randomized controlled trial design among community pharmacists in Alabama to address
two specific aims: 1) to incorporate community pharmacistsâ€™ training needs & expertsâ€™ strategies to overcome
barriers regarding pharmacy-based naloxone services implementation into the development of a targeted
training program; & 2) to evaluate a targeted naloxone training program among community pharmacists.
 Methods: A 2-stage participatory design approach will be employed consisting of: 1) formative interviews
with Alabama community pharmacists & opioid/naloxone experts; & 2) stakeholder panel. Formative interviews
have been completed & qualitatively analyzed to determine pharmacistsâ€™ needs & expertsâ€™ strategies. These
needs & strategies will inform development of a training program using a Delphi process of iterative feedback &
modification with a panel of pharmacistsâ€™ & experts to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of
training content & format. After the program is finalized, Alabama community pharmacists in counties with high
opioid death rates will be invited to participate using a combination of mail, email, & phone recruitment &
randomized to control (no training) or intervention (training) group. The trainingâ€™s impact on pharmacistsâ€™
knowledge, perceived barriers, attitudes, confidence, & intention to implement naloxone services will be
assessed via online surveys at baseline, immediately post-training, & 3 months. Self-reported naloxone service
implementation and dispensing behaviors will be measured at baseline and 3 months. Mean differences
between groups across time-points will be assessed using mixed ANOVA, with associations between
implementation behaviors, knowledge, beliefs, & intentions assessed via GEE models with log-link function.
 Implications: Pharmacistsâ€™ knowledge, confidence, intention, & implementation of naloxone dispensing
activities are expected to increase, suggesting that training programs created via a participatory design
approach are an effective method to increase capacity of trained providers & improve patient access & safety.

Project Narrative
Despite new laws allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a physicianâ€™s prescription, community
pharmacists in Alabama miss opportunities to dispense naloxone to at-risk patients, which is particularly
concerning given that Alabama has the highest rate of opioid prescribing in the country. Educational programs
targeted to pharmacistsâ€™ specific needs and created using a participatory design approach to incorporate
end usersâ€™ needs & expertsâ€™ best strategies have the potential to increase pharmacy-based naloxone
services implementation and decrease these missed opportunities, increase patient access to naloxone, and
improve the safety of patients who use opioids. Thus, the purpose of this project is to create, implement and
assess a targeted pharmacist training program for naloxone therapy management in order to increase
community pharmacistsâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, confidence, intention, and naloxone dispensing activities for
prevention of opioid overdose deaths.

5P20DK119788-02,Influence of Obesity on Endogenous Oxalate Synthesis,"PROJECT: SUMMARY
The prevalence of both obesity and kidney stones is increasing. Since calcium oxalate is the most common type
of stone, it can be inferred that the prevalence of such calculi is also increasing. There is also evidence that
obese individuals excrete more urinary oxalate, a risk factor for the development of calcium oxalate stones. Since
obesity is a risk factor for kidney stones, and the prevalence of both conditions is high in Alabama, the local
environment is ideally suited to conduct research to determine the reasons for these relationships. In this project
we plan to address the hypothesis that obesity is associated with increased endogenous oxalate synthesis. We
will merge the skill sets and knowledge present on the UAB campus in the Centers of Excellence in Obesity and
Diabetes research with those in the Urology Kidney Stone Research Laboratory to address this hypothesis. We
propose to form a Center for research on Obesity and Oxalate Kidney Stones (COOKS) to facilitate these
collaborative investigations. We have developed 2 specific aims.
In Specific Aim 1, we will employ a mouse model of diet-induced obesity to assess for this relationship which
includes a novel approach, the utilization of 13C oxalate precursors, to measure endogenous oxalate synthesis.
Endogenous oxalate synthesis primarily occurs in the liver and we will assess for perturbations in hepatic enzyme
activities that promote endogenous oxalate synthesis. The impact of body fat content will also be measured. In
Specific Aim 2, we will phenotype non-obese and obese non-kidney stone forming adults using controlled low
oxalate diets to estimate endogenous oxalate synthesis. Body fat content and composition and insulin sensitivity
will be measured in the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center (NORC) where one of the Associate Directors of
the proposed center is also director of 2 NORC cores. We have conducted preliminary experiments in mice and
humans which suggest that there are strong relationships between obesity and endogenous oxalate synthesis.
The amalgamation of expertise in this Center should be a pathway for strong future collaborative research

5F31NS100259-03,Astrocytes are a primary target of neuronal-derived BDNF: a novel mechanism for dysfunction in Rett Syndrome,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mature astrocytes are arguably the most morphologically complex cells in the central nervous system. This
complexity is associated with several of the most well characterized functions of this cell type, including
neurotransmitter reuptake, K+ homeostasis, and blood-brain barrier maintenance. While we know the
developmental time window when astrocyte morphological maturation and refinement occurs, we know little
else about this process. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical growth factor secreted largely by
neurons and involved in the development and maturation of neurons, including neuronal growth and synapse
refinement. Preliminary data we have generated for this grant demonstrates that astrocytes express high levels
of the BDNF receptor TrkB when compared to neurons. In particular, the truncated version of TrkB, TrkB.T1 is
the predominate receptor expressed. TrkB.T1 expression is highest in astrocytes during the critical period of
astrocyte morphological refinement and maturation, a developmental time window which also happens to
coincide with highest neuronal BDNF expression levels. Loss of BDNF expression is a hallmark of
neurodevelopment disorder Rett Syndrome, and recent publications indicate that astrocytes have a
significantly reduced morphological complexity and are dysfunctional in this disease. These findings have led
us to the hypothesis that BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling is an important mediator of astrocyte morphological
maturation and that reduced neuronal BDNF expression contributes to astrocyte dysfunction by modulating
astrocyte morphology in Rett Syndrome. We propose to examine BDNFâ€™s influence on astrocyte morphology
utilizing a combination of in vitro and in vivo molecular, genetic, and imaging techniques. Additionally, we will
examine if reduced BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling contribute to aberrant astrocyte morphology in Rett syndrome
which may shed light on how astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of this devastating
disease.","Project Narrative
Rett Syndrome is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 females annually with no
definitive treatment to ameliorate symptoms. We propose to examine BDNF signaling effects on astrocyte
morphological complexity, and how its loss contributes to aberrant astrocyte morphology in Rett Syndrome
through a powerful combination of molecular, genetic, and imaging techniques. Given that astrocytes constitute
nearly 60% of total human brain and spinal cord volume, understanding mechanisms contributing to their
dysfunction is critical to understanding and treating Rett Syndrome.",2019,45016,45016,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Disorders; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Rett Syndrome,Leanne  Holt

5U01NS080165-06,CREST-2 Statistical and Data Coordinating Center - SDCC,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The ACST trial demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertil of enrollment.  We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors,
including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the United States, more than 100,000 carotid endarterectomy or stent procedures are performed annually on patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

5R01AI130232-03,Regulation of Tfh cell differentiation and humoral immunity,"Project Summary
 CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential for germinal center (GC) responses and long-
term humoral immunity. However, the complex regulation that determines the differentiation of Tfh
cells, their developmental progression in GC, and their number and function in helping GC B cell
differentiation and antibody affinity selection, are still not fully understood. Our long-term goals are to
identify novel pathways underlying the differentiation of Tfh cells and design new strategies to
manipulate humoral responses for treatment of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders and to
aid vaccine development.
 Recently we have identified transcription factor Foxp1 as a rate-limiting and critical negative
regulator of Tfh cell differentiation, which drastically affects both the kinetics and the magnitude of the
antibody responses. Our new preliminary data now start to reveal that Foxp1 engages a complex
network of regulators that are coordinated to suppress Tfh cell differentiation as well as Tfh help to B
cells at different stages/steps of the GC response. In this application, we aim to identify Foxp1 targets
and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp1 regulates Tfh cell differentiation. In addition,
we will further delineate how Foxp1-mediated regulation of Tfh cell differentiation affects GC B cell
development, antibody affinity selection and chronic infection. Our study will not only reveal new
components of the transcriptional regulation in Tfh cell differentiation, but also provide fundamental
mechanistic insights in the regulation of GC B cell responses and antibody affinity selection.","Public Health Relevance Statement

5R01GM127411-02,BET regulation of mitosis and pluripotency establishment,"Bromodomain extra terminal (BET) proteins are critical readers of the histone acetyl marks, which generally
signal active transcription. Human BET proteins include the ubiquitous BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, as well as the
testis-specific BRDt. They are key regulators of mitosis and pluripotency reprogramming among many other
cellular and biological processes including transcription, cell cycle, transcriptional memory, and stem cell
identity, as well as viral replication and transcription. Bromodomains (BD) in BET proteins are the
acetyllysine(KAc)-binding modules capable of binding to acetylated core histones. BET proteins are
characterized by two tandem bromodomains (BD-I and BD-II) at their N-termini. Of note, the two tandem BDs
within each BET member are much more diverse than the equivalent BDs among BET member proteins. In
spite of intense investigation, many fundamental questions about these readers of chromatin acetyl marks
remain unsolved. Why are there two BDs within each BET protein? Why are the two tandem BDs of each BET
protein more diverse than the equivalent BDs among the BET member proteins? What are the specific acetyl
marks of histones each individual BD differentially recognizes? Does each individual BD specifically regulate
any biological process? Why do each of human BRD3 and BRD4 has both long and short isoforms? How is the
chromatin-reading activity of each BD regulated? As mitotic proteins, how is their mitotic activity tightly
controlled? Recent findings in my laboratory have paved an avenue to answering many, if not all, of these
fundamental questions. We recently reported that BRD3R, a truncated isoform of human BRD3, uniquely
enhances cellular pluripotency reprogramming via regulating mitosis. Our further preliminary data suggest that
these BRD3R activities are a result of unmasking of the chromatin-reading activities of the second
bromodomain (BD-II) of BRD3/BRD3R due to the absence of the long C-terminal tail. Our additional data
suggest that intramolecular masking of the BD-II activities may be a general mechanism among BET proteins.
We will study how intramolecular masking/unmasking regulate biological and chemical functions of the two
distinct BET bromodomains (Aims 1, 2, and 3). We will also identify the chromatin underpinnings behind the
different biological and cellular functions of the two distinct KAc-binding modules of BET proteins (Aim 3). To
achieve our goals, we will use up-to-date yet firmly established approaches including the chemically defined
reprogramming media, ChIP-seq, ChIP-qPCR, RNA-seq, bioinformatics, histone-tail-peptide pull-down,
histone-peptide array, ligand affinity assay, mutagenesis, protein-protein interaction, and others. Dysregulation
of the BET KAc-reading activities are implicated in various human diseases such as inflammation, diabetes, and
various cancers. The fundamental knowledge gained in this proposed study will provide a scientific basis for
the disease control and management for the BET-associated diseases.","Dysfunction of the Bromodomain and Extra Terminal (BET) proteins, which are the key

5F30HD094446-02,Mechanisms of TGFb in prostaglandin metabolism and fertilization,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infertility is a growing problem that affects millions of people in Western countries. An important reproductive
process that is understudied in internally fertilizing animals is the process by which sperm find the oocyte.
Increasing evidence suggest that sperm respond to chemotactic cues within the oviduct to locate recently
ovulated oocytes. Prostaglandins (PGs) are fat-derived signaling molecules that are implicated in sperm
chemotaxis and other reproductive processes. The TGFÎ² superfamily of peptide ligands is critical for human
ovarian follicle development and fertilization, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the
nematode C. elegans, the TGFÎ² ligand DAF-7 couples environmental conditions to female fertility through the
modulation of F-series prostaglandin (CePGF) metabolism in the ovary. Oocytes secrete a mixture of CePGF
isomers that function as sperm chemoattractants. CePGFs are synthesized by a novel, TGFÎ² dependent
mechanism that may be conserved in mammals. The objective of this project is to investigate the mechanism
by which DAF-7/TGFÎ² regulates CePGF levels and sperm chemotaxis. Preliminary data demonstrate that the
DAF-3 co-SMAD transcription factor represses CePGF synthesis or enhances CePGF breakdown. The central
hypothesis is that DAF-3 acts in transcriptionally active oocyte precursors to regulate expression of genes
critical for CePGF metabolism. Two independent aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. AIM 1 will identify
cellular and subcellular sites of DAF-3 action to promote sperm guidance. CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be
used to determine endogenous DAF-3 expression. Transgenic approaches will be used to identify the key cell
types in which DAF-3 function is necessary and sufficient to regulate sperm chemotaxis. AIM 2 will identify
direct or indirect DAF-3 transcriptional targets that are critical for sperm guidance and CePGF metabolism.
Preliminary data using RNA sequencing and RNA-mediated interference suggest that multiple DAF-3 target
genes act in the germ line to regulate CePGF metabolism. Genetic and mass spectrometry approaches will be
used to test this model. The results obtained from this project will provide novel insight into the mechanism(s)
by which TGFÎ² signaling regulates female fertility, as well as the function(s) and regulation of a new class of
PGs found in C. elegans and mammals.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R00HD082686-03,Thyroid hormone receptors and adrenocortical remodeling.,"Most hormone disorders of the adrenal cortex occur in the context of overgrowth or underdevelopment of the
adrenal gland. At embryonic stages, the fetal adrenal cortex already has the ability to synthesize and secrete
steroid hormones that are critical for fetal development. These functional fetal cortical cells then undergo
regression and are replaced by continuously renewing adult-like cortical cells after birth. The continuously
renewing adult cortical cells grow from the outermost layer of the cortex and form the â€œadult zoneâ€, whereas
fetal cortical cells stay in the inner portion of the cortex, losing the steroid synthesis ability overtime and form
the â€œfetal zoneâ€. During development, the fetal zone (x-zone in mice) regresses while the adult zone grows.
However, the mechanisms that regulate the differential development and the regression of the cell layers of the
adrenal cortex remain unclear. We have used several unique mouse models to obtain preliminary results that
lead to the central hypothesis: thyroid hormone receptor (TR) positive cells, a novel cell population in the
adrenal cortex, regulates the remodeling of the adrenal cortical layers. In Aim 1, we will delineate the
contribution of this novel identified cell population to adrenal cortical differentiation and remodeling by using our
unique knock-in reporter mouse lines for detection of expression TR isoforms. The cell fate of cells in the x-zone
will also be investigated by lineage tracing. In Aim 2, we will use next generation sequencing and
genome-wide DNA analysis to identify target genes underlying thyroid hormone-mediated remodeling of the
adrenal gland. In Aim 3, we will further study the transcriptional function of TR and its co-repressors in the
adrenal gland. The proposed study links the function of these two endocrine organs and aims to use thyroid
hormone receptor-mediated effects in adrenocortical remodeling as a novel approach to address fundamental
questions about the mechanisms that control the differentiation and maintenance of adrenocortical cell layers.","Results from this project will contribute to research aimed at the development of optimal treatment for
hormonal diseases involving the adrenal and thyroid glands. Elucidation of the roles of thyroid hormone in

7K23EY025273-06,Myopia Control in Children with Low-Dose Atropine and Soft Bifocal Contact Lenses,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this career development award are three-fold: 1) to provide training to Juan Huang, PhD OD to become an independent clinician-scientist; 2) to investigate whether adding 0.01% low concentrate atropine to soft bifocal contact lens wear will result in a greater effect of slowing myopia progression than administering soft bifocal contact lens alone in children; and 3) to evaluate the relationship between short-term changes in choroidal thickness and long-term regulation of myopia progression and ocular growth. A five-year career development plan is proposed, including formal coursework in clinical and translational science, as well as collaboration with accomplished mentors who are experts in specific areas related to the proposed research project. The proposed study is aligned with NEI's objective to ""evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments, such as pharmacological approaches, special spectacles, and contact lenses, for slowing the progression of myopia."" Both atropine and soft bifocal contact lenses have been shown to slow myopia progression, and both can cause changes in choroidal thickness. But the relationship between these mechanisms is unclear. The central hypothesis to be tested is that atropine and soft bifocal contact lenses each exert their anti-progression actions through a common pathway that involves the choroid. If this is correct, then adding atropine treatment to soft bifocal contact lens wear will lead to a
more effective slowing of myopia progression than prescribing soft bifocal contact lenses alone due to the additive effects in the common pathway. To test the hypothesis, I propose a clinical study, which would be an ancillary study of a multi-center, randomized clinical trial, the Bifocal Lenses In Nearsighted Kids (BLINK) Study (U10EY023208) chaired by my primary mentor. The BLINK Study compares myopia progression between subjects who wear single vision contact lenses and those wearing soft bifocal contact lenses. I will enroll an additional 49 subjects that are age-matched with the participants who are wearing +2.50D add soft bifocal contact lenses in the BLINK Study. The subjects I enroll will wear +2.50D add soft bifocal contact lenses in combination with daily administration of one drop of 0.01% atropine in each eye for three years. The rates of myopia progression and axial elongation will be compared to the rates in participants who are receiving treatment with +2.50D add soft bifocal contact lenses alone in the BLINK Study. Two specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To test whether the combined treatment of 0.01% atropine and soft bifocal contact lens wear produces slower myopia progression and axial elongation compared to soft bifocal contact lenses alone over 3 years. Aim 2: To test whether early changes in choroidal thickness can be used as predictors of long-term myopia progression / axial elongation. The results of this study will have significant implications for future studies to develop and test new therapeutic regimes that optimize the effect of myopia control through combined pharmacological and optical interventions. The outcomes will also aid in understanding the potential role of short-term changes of choroidal thickness in long- term regulation of myopia progression and ocular growth.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myopia is a common eye disease and is listed among the top five priority eye diseases by the World Health Organization due to its high prevalence and significant socio-economic effects worldwide. The reported prevalence of myopia has increased significantly over the past three or four decades, and it currently affects approximately one-third
of the population in the United States. The results of the proposed study can potentially change the standard of care for the treatment of myopia in children, and lead to novel strategies that optimize the effect of myopia control through combined pharmacological and optical interventions.",2019,150000,138889,11111,Other Research-Related,K23,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,,Juan  Huang
5R01DK111483-03,Revealing LIM Domain Transcriptional Complexes that establish and maintain Beta Cell Mass,"Pancreatic islets of Langerhans contain insulin-secreting Î²-cells required for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Dysfunction in Î²-cell activity or survival results in diabetes mellitus, a disease affecting millions of Americans with numbers expected to greatly increase. This is creating an enormous economic and health care burden. A future strategy for improving diabetic outcomes will include cell-based therapies wherein functional Î²-cells are generated to replenish those lost during diabetes progression. Success will require increasing our understanding of the complex transcriptional programs required for establishing and maintaining Î²-cells during development and in adults, respectively.  My lab and others previously demonstrated that the Islet-1 transcription factor is important for islet cell
development and function. Furthermore, Islet-1 activity during late phases of Î²-cell development requires the interacting transcriptional co-regulator, Ldb1. However, little is known of the comparative target genes and pathways governed by these factors. The complexity of Ldb1-mediated complexes also appears greater than simply through Islet-1. For example, our recently published data suggests that Ldb1/Islet-1 complexes are very large, also containing SSBP3, a co-regulator required for Ldb1 complex activity and stability in vitro. This suggests that SSBP3 is a new player in Î²-cell development and function. Three complementary Aims will define comparative roles of Ldb1 complexes during islet development, and in adult Î²-cells. Aim 1 will utilize conditional Ldb1 knockout models to test function in pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells and beyond. We will examine how Ldb1 impacts pancreas marker expression, cell proliferation and survival, endocrine cell identity, and islet function.

1R43NS110114-01,Enhanced endothelialization of nanomatrix coated flow diverter for intracranial aneurysms,"Approximately 3% of the population has unruptured cerebral aneurysms, approximately 6 million people in the
US. About 30,000 rupture per year, with devastating consequences. About 40% of patients with ruptured
aneurysms die, and 4 of 7 who survive have significant disabilities. Coil embolization therapy is associated
with a high rate of recurrence. Flow diverters are increasingly being used to cover the neck of the aneurysm
providing more durable occlusion. However, until endothelialization and aneurysm occlusion has occurred
patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic complications and increased intracranial hemorrhage due to
necessary dual antiplatelet therapy.
We have developed a nanomatrix coating that mimics the characteristic properties of native endothelium.
Thus, we hypothesize that the nanomatrix coating on the flow diverter can enhance endothelial coverage and
accelerate aneurysm closure. The coating provides sustained release of nitric oxide (NO) over 2 months, thus
recruiting and retaining endothelial cells. It also incorporates an endothelial cell adhesive ligand that promotes
endothelial cell retention and migration. The bionanomatrix is a biocompatable peptide based material and is
coated on the coils by simple water evaporation. This coating method minimizes the risk of inflammatory
responses.
In this Phase I SBIR, we propose to evaluate the coating for flow diverters for treatment of brain aneurysms.
This will include 1) characterization of nanomatrix coating; 2) assessment of coating structural integrity; 3)
evaluation of endothelial cell attachment, growth and migration; 4) evaluation of platelet adhesion; and 5)
evaluation of monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and expression of monocyte inflammatory genes. In
collaboration with Dr. Kadirvel's group at the Mayo Clinic, in vivo assessment will verify that the nanomatrix
coating improves endothelial coverage of flow diverters compared to a standard flow diverter in a rabbit
aneurysm model.
Development of the nanomatrix coating that enhances occlusion of aneurysms and healing over the flow
diverters may have significant impact in the treatment of patients with brain aneurysms. With successful
completion of Phase I, we plan to move forward in Phase II towards IDE submission.","Brain aneurysms carry the devastating risk of rupture, leading to death or permanent disability. Currently
available flow diverters used to treat aneurysms are limited by a significant risk of thromboembolic

1R03DK120503-01,Renal implications of AQP3 lysine acetylation,"SUMMARY
Fluid-electrolyte disorders are prevalent in our society, and even mild disorders are associated
with poor outcomes. A key component of body fluid regulation is largely through control of water
reabsorption by the renal collecting duct (CD) via the actions of vasopressin. The aquaporins
(AQPs) are a large family of water channels expressed throughout the body. In the CD, there is
apical expression of AQP2 and basolateral expression of AQP3 and AQP4 that regulate
transcellular water reabsorption. AQP2 and AQP3 are vasopressin-sensitive, and genetic deletion
of either of these water channels results in severe polyuria and a urinary concentrating defect.
Compared to AQP2, we know little about the regulation of AQP3 function. We recently determined
that AQP3 can be post-translationally lysine (K) acetylated at K282. Acetylated AQP3 (acAQP3)
is expressed in the basolateral membrane of the CD and is increased with water deprivation in
both male and female mice. Moreover, acAQP3 expression increases in the inner medullary
collecting duct with dehydration. Our central hypothesis is that lysine acetylated AQP3 is critical
for maintaining fluid balance during water deprivation. Our preliminary data suggest that the
acetyltransferases CBP (CREB Binding Protein) and EP300 interact and lysine acetylate AQP3.
The focus of our â€œintracellular signaling aimâ€ is to test the hypothesis that vasopressin activates
CBP and EP300 resulting in lysine acetylation of AQP3. We will also determine the functional
significance of this novel post-translational modification. The goal of the â€œphysiology aimâ€ is to
test the hypothesis that acetylation of AQP3 results in anti-diuresis. Identification of acetylation of
AQP3 K282 provides a new target for therapeutic interventions to treat water balance disorders.
The data, reagents, tools, and mice generated from this application are key for the successful
submission and subsequent funding of my R01 within the next two years.","Narrative
Body fluid homeostasis is maintained through the actions of vasopressin-mediated water reabsorption via the
apical AQP2 and basolateral AQP3 in the collecting duct. We recently discovered that AQP3 is lysine acetylated,
which is the first ever report of a post-translational modification of AQP3. The goals of this study are to determine
the regulation and physiological function of AQP3 lysine acetylation.",2019,111375,75000,36375,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Kidney Disease,Kelly  Hyndman
5K01DK105038-05,Novel mechanisms of HDAC1 regulation of renal collecting duct function,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Water balance is maintained through the regulation of water reabsorption by the renal collecting duct (CD) via the vasopressin (AVP) regulated water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Dysfunction in AQP2 leads to diseases such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (polyuria) or antidiuresis syndrome (water retention), and severe fluid retention is a common ailment in cardiovascular disease. Histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysines of histones leading to epigenetic modification of gene transcription or non-histone proteins in a post-translational manner. There is growing interest in the therapeutic use of HDAC inhibitors in cardiovascular disease because of their anti- inflammatory properties. Interestingly, a reported side effect of HDAC inhibitor use is hyponatremia, suggesting these drugs affect fluid balance. Thus, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the role of HDACs in body fluid balance in order to avoid potentially dangerous side effects. Our compelling preliminary data support a novel role for HDAC1 regulation of diuresis by regulating transcription and deacetylation of proteins in the CD. Our central hypothesis is that during excess water consumption, HDAC1 mediates diuresis via regulation of AQP2 apical expression by directly deacetylating AQP2, indirectly by decreasing expression of the AVP subtype 2 receptor (V2R), and indirectly by increasing in nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) derived nitric oxide (NO). The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) To test the hypothesis that water balance is maintained by changes in collecting duct AQP2 acetylation and apical surface expression; 2) To test the hypothesis that hydration promotes deacetylation of AQP2 and/or downregulation of the V2R receptor via HDAC1 in the CD, thus promoting diuresis; 3) To test the hypothesis that HDAC1-dependent increases in CD NO derived from NOS1 leads to decreases in AQP2 surface expression. With the help of mentor and advisory team, I will continue on the path towards my long term goal of developing a strong, independent, research program in the field of cardio/renal physiology with a focus on addressing novel mechanisms underlying cardio/renal diseases.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Water balance is a fundamental physiological process that is controlled by the kidneys. Imbalances of body water are causally linked with kidney disease, which is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.

5R01DK044628-22,TLR4 in the Regulation of Renal Microvascular Function,"Project Summary:
Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease among US citizens and causes significant endo
organ damage due to inflammation, and tissue injury. Exquisite autoregulatory control of renal vascular
resistance is essential to protect against hyperbaric trauma and glomerular injury. Loss of autoregulatory
control, as occurs in hypertension, increases glomerular capillary pressure and promotes renal injury.
Hypertension activates inflammatory cascades that sustain the hypertensive state and accelerate renal injury
progression. Anti-inflammatory treatment prevents autoregulatory impairment but a critical barrier to progress
with hypertensive renal injury is identification of the inflammatory mechanisms involved. We now provide
compelling new evidence identifying toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and major histocompatibility complex class II
(MHC-II) molecules as mechanistic links between inflammation and autoregulatory dysfunction. The studies
proposed address the central hypothesis the TLR4 on renal microvascular cells and on resident MHC-II
bearing cells is activated in hypertension, leading to afferent arteriole autoregulatory dysfunction and kidney
injury. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic TLR4 activation with low dose LPS treatment blunts afferent
arteriole autoregulatory behavior. We will use the blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation to
investigate the role of TLR4 signaling on autoregulatory function. Chronic administration of the TLR4 agonist,
LPS, anti-TLR4 antibodies or TLR4 antagonists will reveal the role of TLR4 in intact renal microvessels of
normotensive rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that AngII hypertension blunts autoregulatory behavior
through mechanisms linked to TLR4 activation. Autoregulatory behavior will be assessed in vitro and in vivo in
AngII-infused hypertensive rats with and without chronic administration of LPS, anti-TLR4 antibody or a TLR4
antagonist to establish the role of TLR4 in the renal microvascular dysfunction that occurs in AngII
hypertension. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that TLR4-mediated loss of autoregulation in AngII hypertension
is prevented by targeting MHC-II. A novel CLIP antagonist that ameliorates TLR4-mediated loss of
autoregulation will test the efficacy of targeting MHC-II in AngII hypertension. Upon completion of these
aims, we will have established that chronic TLR4 activation leads to a decline in renal microvascular
autoregulatory capability and that this process is linked to MHC-II immune activation. We further expect
that TLR4 activation underlies the renal autoregulatory dysfunction in AngII-induced hypertension through
this MHC-II mechanism and contributes to hypertensive renal injury.","Project Narrative
Millions of US citizens are hypertensive and can progress to renal injury. While linkage of inflammation with
hypertension is recognized, the inflammatory signals involved are unknown. We propose that renal
autoregulatory impairment in hypertension involves TLR4 activation. These studies will advance our
understanding of the link between TLR4-induced inflammatory cascades and autoregulatory dysfunction.",2019,507126,341499,165627,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Kidney Disease,Edward W Inscho
5R01HL136666-03,Genetic underpinnings of cardiorenal risk in Africans and African Americans,"ABSTRACT
Hypertension (HTN) has earlier onset and takes on a more severe form in African Americans (AAs) as
compared to other U.S. populations, which translates to higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
endpoints including stroke and end stage renal disease. The rates of related comorbidities including type 2
diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also higher in AAs. These remarkable disparities equate
to important consequences for the health of AA communities. Emerging data suggest genetic markers
originating in Africa incur disease risk in this population. Prior genetic association studies of HTN, T2D, and
CKD have been undertaken in AAs. However, the ancestral genetic variation coverage and sample sizes that
have been achieved in genetic studies of European Ancestry populations have not yet been achieved for
African ancestry populations. Additionally, a direct comparison of risk alleles between AA and African
populations has yet to be made. To address these important research gaps, we propose a study that
substantially expands the number of AAs with relevant phenotype and genotype data and dramatically
improves the coverage of African specific genetic variation in a large number of AAs belonging to existing
cardiovascular epidemiology cohorts. We propose genotyping 8000 AAs from the REasons for Geographic and
Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and 2000 West Africans from the Human Health and Heredity
in Africa (H3A) Kidney Network, newly bringing these 10,000 participants into genetic studies. We will combine
these data with existing genotype data from 2000 H3A participants and recently generated high-coverage
whole genome sequence (WGS) data on ~6500 AAs, with relevant phenotype data, from the NHLBIâ€™s Trans-
Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. The TOPMed WGS data will be further used to impute
sequence variants into REGARDS, H3A and the ~15,000 previously genotyped AA participants from other
NHLBI cohorts. We will use these unprecedented resources to conduct the most comprehensive study of
cardiorenal traits (blood pressure, renal function, fasting glucose) in AAs to date. We will follow up our top
variant-association findings in an independent replication sample of 11,000 AAs with relevant data. Finally, we
will test whether variants associated with these risk factors are also associated with CVD outcomes. Our
proposed study, including a total of ~40,500 AAs and 4000 West Africans, will provide us an unprecedented
opportunity to evaluate the role of genetic variation, and in particular African-derived genetic variation, in the
increased susceptibility to CVD and renal disease in AAs.

5R01HL123782-04,Genomic Background of Blood Pressure Response to Thiazide Diuretic in African Americans,"Abstract
African Americans (AA) are overburdened with hypertension compared to other racial groups in the United
States. The disorder often takes on a more severe form including earlier onset, resistance to treatment, and
earlier end organ damage suggesting the need for personalized medicine strategies for prevention and
treatment in this group. Observational studies and clinical trials have shown that commonly used
antihypertensive agents exert variable blood pressure (BP) lowering effects in ethnic populations. For example,
compared to Caucasians, AAs exhibit significantly poorer BP lowering response to beta-blocker, angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB's), and a much better response to
calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics when used as monotherapy. The eighth Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure suggests calcium
channel blockers and diuretics should be the first-line antihypertensive therapy for AAs. However, data show
there is more variation in response to antihypertensive treatment classes within race groups than between
them. Despite the clinical reliance on thiazide diuretics for AAs, no large scale pharmacogenetic discovery
effort has been undertaken. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding metabolic side effects for this drug
class, including abnormal glucose tolerance and hypokalemia. This is of particular importance to patients of
African ancestry, who have a higher risk of developing diabetes, and often need to start treatment at a younger
age. More than half of published pharmacogenetic studies do not include AAs, and, among those that do, the
average sample size is small (<200). In order to overcome the limitations of previous research and enable
genetic discovery of genes and variants which predict blood pressure response as well as metabolic response
to thiazide diuretic, we will leverage data and specimens from 4830 AAs randomized to chlorthalidone from the
Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment (GenHAT) study, an ancillary study of the Antihypertensive
and Lipid lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). Genomic discovery will be enriched for
African Ancestry genetic variations, functional variation, as well as known pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic variants. We have established an agreement with the International Consortium for
Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies (ICAPS) for validation of our findings. Genes associated with
thiazide diuretic response will be evaluated for association with cardiovascular disease outcomes in AAs from
GENHAT and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study (REGARDS). In sum, the
project will shed light on the mechanisms of thiazide diuretic response; potentially identify new treatment
targets; and identify genetic markers which can optimize treatment in this high risk population.","Narrative

1U34HL148472-01,Trauma Resuscitation with Group O Whole Blood Or Products (TROOP) Trial,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This U34 application is for the planning of a future clinical trial â€œTrauma Resuscitation with Group O Whole
Blood Or Productsâ€ (TROOP). The overarching aims of this proposal are to mature the statistical design of the
TROOP trial, and to develop the research infrastructure required to carry out the trial. Our efforts will be
complemented by guidance and input from the NIH Innovative Clinical Trials Resource. These efforts will lead
to a future NIH application to support a large multicenter clinical trial.
Bleeding (hemorrhage) is the most common cause of preventable death after injury. Treatment of bleeding
requires both surgery (to stop the bleeding) and replacement of lost blood. In order to allow donated blood to
serve multiple patients, modern blood banking practices separate donor blood into multiple components (red
blood cells, plasma, and platelets). However, severely injured patients require all of these components. Military
experience during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have innovated the use of whole unseparated blood in
resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock. While simpler and potentially more effective than separated blood
products, the benefit of whole blood or component blood in the setting of hemorrhage shock is unknown. We
aim to carry out a multicenter clinical trial (TROOP) comparing whole blood vs conventional separated
component blood in the resuscitation of traumatic hemorrhagic shock. We propose to use a Bayesian group-
sequential design for this study, which makes better use of existing information, requires fewer patients, and
provides answers more quickly. Bayesian designs are innovative, but also more complex, and require more
planning and preparation than conventional trials. We also plan to incorporate a cost-effectiveness analysis to
assess the value of the interventions.
Key tasks during the planning phase will include refinement of the Bayesian design, elicitation of expert opinion
to support Bayesian prior probability estimates, collection of baseline cost data, recruitment of hospitals to
participate in the trial, development of data collection infrastructure, interface with the Food and Drug
Administration, and development of the clinical trial protocol.
The TROOP trial will entail a collaborative effort between the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The effort will unite experts in trauma surgery, critical
care, emergency medicine, biostatistics, health economics, and trials methodology. The knowledge gained
from the TROOP trial would directly impact civilian and military trauma care, identifying the optimal approach to
blood transfusion therapy in severely injured patients.","RELEVANCE

5F31DK111181-03,The role of Lhx1 in pancreatic beta cell development and function,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The gradual loss of insulin-producing beta cells of the endocrine pancreas is common to all forms of diabetes.
Elucidating transcriptional complexes that increase our understanding of underlying mechanisms governing
pancreatic beta-cell development and function is critical for the development of novel therapeutics that will
improve beta-cell function. Loss- and gain-of-function mouse studies have demonstrated critical roles of
transcription factors in regulating the establishment and function of beta cells. Preliminary data from our lab
and others suggest Lhx1, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed and functions in the
developing and adult pancreas. Over the next three years, I propose to investigate in detail the role of Lhx1 in
regulating beta-cell development and function using beta cell lines as well as a newly developed conditional
knockout model. I hypothesize that Lhx1 is a regulator of endocrine cell development and function. In Aim
1, I will characterize Lhx1 expression at specific developmental and postnatal stages. In Aim 2, I will determine
Lhx1 gene regulatory mechanisms in beta cells. In Aim 3, I will characterize the effects of Lhx1 ablation in the
developing and adult pancreas using pancreas-specific cre/lox knockout approaches.""","Project Narrative

5R01HL095783-07,Critical roles of CHD7 during mouse cardiogenesis,"Abstract:
 CHARGE syndrome (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retardation of
growth/development, Genital abnormalities and Ear anomalies) is a severe developmental disorder affecting
multiple organs. Congenital heart diseases are major clinical features of CHARGE syndrome, affecting >75%
of patients. More than 70% of all CHARGE cases are caused by the haploinsufficiency of CHD7, a gene that
encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor. The major goal of this project is to reveal the
functions of CHD7 during heart development and therefore provide mechanistic insights into the birth defects
caused by mutations in CHD7.
 We recently identified CHD7 as an embryonic heart interaction partner of SMADs1, 5, and 8
(SMADs1/5/8), which are BMP receptor-activated SMADs. We further showed that CHD7 is required for
normal expression of Nkx2.5, a core cardiogenic transcription factor downstream of BMP signaling. Thus, our
study provided the first evidence implicating CHD7 as a direct epigenetic regulator of cardiogenic genes.
Currently, the functions and molecular activities of CHD7 during heart development remain largely elusive,
presenting a major barrier for understanding the developmental basis for the heart defects in CHARGE
patients. We hypothesize that CHD7 regulates the epigenetic architecture of crucial cardiogenic genes to
promote normal heart development in mammals. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. In the
1st aim, we will reveal the regulatory target network of CHD7 in cardiomyocytes derived from the second heart
field (SHF) and examine how CHD7 is specifically loaded onto its target sites. In the 2nd aim, we will test the
role of CHD7 in recruiting histone methyltransferase to promote methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 at its
associated enhancers.
 Accomplishing the proposed studies will not only greatly advance our knowledge of the tissular-,
cellular- and molecular- activities of CHD7 in developing hearts, but also will provide us with crucial clues
regarding how an epigenetic regulator acts coordinately with other genetic/epigenetic regulators to promote
normal cardiogenesis in mammals. Information obtained from our research will be invaluable for understanding
the mechanisms underlying the heart defects observed in CHARGE syndrome patients.","In this study, we will test the functions of Chd7 during mouse cardiogenesis.",2019,407790,274606,133184,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Rare Diseases,KAI  JIAO
5F31DK112646-03,C-reactive protein mediated signals in renal injury and repair,"Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major healthcare concern, affecting ~13.3 million patients per year world-wide
and causing ~1.7 million deaths. Despite the resolution of renal injury in many survivors, patients with AKI are
predisposed to developing chronic kidney disease. Easing this burden will require new and effective therapies,
but their development has been hindered by the limited knowledge of the injury mechanisms in AKI. A common
cause of AKI is renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), characterized by impairment of oxygen and nutrient
supply triggering renal tubular epithelial cell (TEC) injury upon reperfusion. Renal IRI is accompanied by a
systemic inflammatory response, but the contribution of this response to AKI is not fully understood. Our group
showed that a recognized biomarker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP), exacerbates injury in a human
CRP transgenic (CRPtg) mouse model of bilateral renal IRI. The worsened outcome seen in CRPtg mice
involves human CRP-mediated alteration of the subtypes of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
infiltrating the injured kidney. Indeed, targeted lowering of human CRP prior to renal IRI both normalizes MDSC
subtype balance and protects the kidney. Relevant literature show that both pharmacological inhibition of
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and specific renal proximal TEC deletion of the beta isoform (GSK3Î²)
attenuate AKI and later renal fibrosis, suggesting a role for GSK3 kinase activity in balancing successful and
maladaptive renal repair after AKI. My preliminary data shows that CRP dose-dependently modulates GSK3Î²
phosphorylation (and thus GSK3Î² kinase activity) in vitro in wild type bone marrow-derived MDSCs. I therefore
hypothesize that CRP binding to the inhibitory type Fc gamma receptor IIB (FcÎ³RIIB), which is expressed by
renal cells such as MDSCs and TECs, leads to downstream modulation of GSK3Î² kinase activity, thereby
effecting signaling cascades propelling AKI. Through studying this novel causal signaling pathway new
therapeutic targets for AKI could be revealed. In addition, this project describes the dissertation research that
corresponds to the pre-doctoral training planned in cooperation between the Principal Investigator (myself),
Sponsor (Alexander Szalai, PhD), and Co-Sponsor (Anupam Agarwal, MD). This project will provide me an
opportunity for skill development in molecular, cellular, and immunohistochemical techniques, mouse disease
and surgical manipulation, analysis of the mechanisms and processes underlying a pathophysiological
response and therein the human translatable applications. The successful completion of the research and
training detailed within this project would therefore produce a highly proficient Immunologist specialized in
Nephrology with a range of skills applicable to many research areas.","Project Narrative

1U01DD001237-01,Research Approaches to Improve the Care and Outcomes of People Living with Spina Bifida- Component B,"Project Summary
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has been dedicated to the National Spina Bifida Patient
Registry (NSBPR) since its inception. The CDC recognized the need and benefits of a registry to promote
advances in all areas of health care for individuals with spina bifida and established the NSBPR. The goal of
this initiative was to improve the quality of healthcare as well as to gain an understanding of the demographics
and characteristics of individuals with spina bifida.
UAB is committed to continue the collection of longitudinal data on children and adults with spina bifida seen in
our clinics. These data will be used to promote quality of care by determining best practices through comparing
differences in interventions and outcomes among participating clinics. UAB has a unique contribution in that
there is both a pediatric and adult multidisciplinary clinic. The pediatric population is more than 500 patients
and the adult population is just over 200 patients. Many of these patients have been included in the NSBPR
since the beginning and continuing to provide longitudinal data on them is critical to understanding how
treatment inventions impact patients over time.
 UAB has been successful in the previous funding cycles of the NSBPR in terms of patient enrollment, timely
reporting, and research presented and published. Two of the major neurosurgical papers produced using
NSBPR data were published from UAB. There have also been 17 projects published with contribution from
UAB using local and aggregate NSBPR data.
If awarded, during the next funding cycle we intend to complete projects using both local and aggregate
NSBPR data. Local projects include 1) the assessment of the contribution of baseline sleep studies in patients
with and without symptoms for sleep disordered breathing (SDB); 2.) to study the adult population to describe
their need for surgical intervention after transitioning to adult care. Projects with aggregate data include 1.) to
study SDB using the new NSBPR sleep variables; 2.) to investigate the impact that body mass index plays in
ambulation changes over time and 3.) to coordinate a study on the aggregate NSBPR cohort with closed
dysraphisms that have not previous undergone surgical intervention. This robust list of projects will provide a
great contribution to the understanding of the care of individuals with spina bifida.","Project Narrative:
The National Spina Bifida Registry Project was designed to serve as a systematic approach to track variation
in treatment across clinics nationwide in an effort to improve the quality of care of individuals with spina bifida

1U01DD001236-01,Research Approaches to Improve the Care and Outcomes of People Living with Spina Bifida- Component C,"Project Summary- Component C
 The urologic management of the newborn and young child with spina bifida is currently based on
dogma and â€œexpert opinionâ€, a significant limitation when it comes to determining â€œbest practiceâ€ standards. It is
accepted that >90% of newborns with spina bifida have normal kidney function and normal appearing kidneys.
If unattended; approximately 50% encounter some degree of kidney compromise by the age of 5 years. There
is a need for standardization of the urologic care of the newborn and young child with spina bifida using a
management protocol that will protect kidney function and control hostile bladder function. The proposed
Urologic Management to Preserve Initial Renal Function Protocol for Young Children with Spina Bifida
(UMPIRE Protocol) from birth through the age of 10 years provides the opportunity to develop an evidenced-
based model for the care of children with a neurogenic bladder secondary to spina bifida. The desired
outcome of the protocol is to preserve and protect normal kidney function while utilizing resources in a cost
efficient fashion.
 The previous funding cycle provided the framework for the UMPIRE protocol and described the
treatment regimen for the child with spina bifida from birth through the first 5 years of life. Continuing to follow
these children for the next 5 years, until age 10, will be critically important in validating the success of the
protocol as written. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has enrolled 35 patients in the UMPIRE
project which represents 100% of patients born with spina bifida at our site.
 Throughout the duration of the protocol, testing of bladder function is undertaken along with
assessment of kidney function and appearance. Data is collected on an ongoing basis that is sent
electronically to the CDC for analysis. Changes to the protocol may occur when it becomes apparent changes
would improve kidney health.
 A successful outcome has universal appeal and the potential to standardize the care of children with
neurogenic bladder dysfunction across all neuropathic disorders of which spina bifida makes up the greatest
percent based on etiology. This becomes exceedingly important not only for the large centers caring for
children with a neurogenically abnormal bladder but also for smaller centers that donâ€™t have the patient volume
that would allow them to make any reasonable predictions on management based on their own data. In
addition to continuing to provide data points on the 35 patients currently enrolled, UAB also intends to continue
patient enrollment of all newborns born with spina bifida at our site. Finally, UAB has proposed a project to
determine the incidence of bladder hostility in patients enrolled in the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry
prior to the beginning of the UMPIRE protocol and compare that with patients enrolled in the UMPIRE.","Project Narrative

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Eric Judd, a nephrologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Dr. Judd proposes a novel treatment pathway for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and his long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator devoted to identifying and/or developing CKD-specific therapies. This award will allow Dr. Judd the resources and protected time to achieve the following career development goals: (1) to become an expert in endothelial and vascular function in CKD; (2) to implement advanced biostatistical methods in clinical trials (3) to become an independent, translational clinical investigator in the fields of vasculature and CKD. To achieve these goals, Dr. Judd has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. David Calhoun (an expert in vascular function testing including ultrasound assessment of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and aldosterone physiology), a co-mentor, Dr. Michael Allon (an expert in clinical trials and vascular access in the late stages of CKD), and 3 content experts: Dr. Anupam Agarwal, PI for the NIDDK funded O'Brien Center at our institution; Dr. Rakesh Patel, an authority in measuring oxidative stress as a marker of endothelial function; and Dr. Gary Cutter, an expert in the statistical methods in clinical trials.  Vascular endothelial dysfunction increases cardiovascular (CV) risk and contributes to the progression of CKD. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists have been shown to improve endothelial function, as well as decrease CV mortality and proteinuria. The specific biochemical pathways that produce these pharmacological effects for MR antagonists, however, are poorly understood. Dr. Judd will investigate the effect of MR antagonism on endothelial function in patients with moderate (stage III) CKD by performing a randomized, controlled trial. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine if spironolactone improves endothelial function as compared to amiloride in patients with stage III CKD; Aim 2: To determine if oxidative stress is associated with changes in endothelial function by spironolactone compared to amiloride in patients with stage III CKD; and Aim 3: To determine if endothelial dysfunction contributes to albuminuria in patients with stage III CKD. Relevance: A better understanding of the mechanisms of kidney function decline in CKD could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies, translating into alleviating patient suffering, caregiver burden, and health care costs.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A better understanding of the mechanisms of kidney function decline in chronic kidney disease could lead to important interventions and prevention strategies, translating into alleviating patient suffering, caregiver burden, and health care costs",2019,194476,180070,14406,Other Research-Related,K23,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Kidney Disease; Prevention,Eric K Judd

Â 
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia and stroke are substantially higher among blacks
aged 45+, and among residents of the southeastern region of the US. The REasons for
Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study is national, longitudinal cohort
study of ~ 30,000 blacks and whites designed to advance the understanding of the
epidemiology of cognitive decline and stroke, and the contributors to racial and geographic
disparities in these outcomes. The current application has three aims:
 1. Identify social, cardiovascular, and environmental mechanisms of racial and geographic
 disparities in incident vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).
 With assessment in mid-life and over a decade of longitudinal cognitive data, REGARDS is
 uniquely positioned to identify vascular, social, and behavioral mechanisms underlying
 disparities in VCID, and modifiable pathways on which interventions may narrow disparities
 in VCID. After completion of a nested calibration/confirmation study to develop an algorithm
 for the classification of MCI and dementia, we will characterize racial and geographic
 disparities in VCID and determine if interventions on mediators would diminish or eliminate
disparities.
 2. Answer as-yet-unanswered questions in stroke and cerebrovascular disease epidemiology.
 By continuing the successful approaches for stroke surveillance among 17000 active cohort
 members, the study will assess the association of risk factor changes and novel biomarkers
 quantified with the completion of the second in-person exam with stroke risk and disparities
 in stroke risk. In addition, with the aging of the cohort, this aim will provide greatly needed
 information on stroke epidemiology in the elderly.
 3. Utilize incident risk factor data and biospecimens to identify pathways for development of
 incident hypertension and diabetes, with the goal of understanding the impact on incident
 VCID and stroke. We have documented that â‰ˆ30% of the racial disparity in stroke risk is
 attributable to racial disparities in prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and the study
 will investigate the biomarker pathways contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension
 and diabetes in blacks.
 Each proposed aim addresses a topic of profound public health impact, and REGARDS
 progress to date uniquely positions the study to address these aims using proven approaches
 in an efficient manner.","Â

5U01DK115997-03,APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) Clinical Center,"Shorter allograft survival is observed for kidneys transplanted from deceased African American donors relative
to those from deceased European American donors. Recent retrospective reports have indicated that the
presence of two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) renal-risk variants in the kidney donors significantly
contributes to this disparity. APOL1 renal-risk variants are common in U.S. populations with African ancestry
(primarily African Americans) and are strongly associated with end-stage renal disease for patients with non-
diabetic kidney disease, yet these risk variants are rare in other ethnic groups. Before APOL1 genotypic data
can be widely applied in the transplant community, however, a prospective multi-center study must be
performed to evaluate outcomes of kidneys from donors with African ancestry. Critical clinical post-transplant
information that was lacking in the prior retrospective studies needs to be collected, particularly kidney-biopsy
data and key potential modifiers such as development of viral infections, donor-specific antibodies, and
episodes of acute rejection. The NIH will fund a nationwide prospective study to assess the impact of APOL1
renal-risk variants on the outcomes of recipients of a kidney from a deceased or living donor with African
ancestry and on the kidney health of living donors with African ancestry after nephrectomy. The study will
consist of as many as 15 Clinical Centers and a central Scientific Data Research Center (SDRC). The Clinical
Centers will collect one-time blood samples from each participant for APOL1 genotyping at the SDRC and will
submit longitudinal clinical data for the recipients and living donors to the SDRC to assess the impact of
APOL1 genotype on development of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The results from this

5R01HL125391-05,Prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent,"DESCRIPTION:  Stents are the most common cardiovascular implants used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, there are concerns about in-stent restenosis with bare metal stents (BMS) and late stent thrombosis and late inflammatory responses with drug-eluting stents (DES). Despite the promise of recently developed strategies to overcome the challenges of current stents, there remain many emerging concerns and limitations. Development of innovative strategies to restore endothelial healing while limiting the risk of late stent thrombosis, inflammatory responses, and restenosis is critical for the long-term success of stents.  In nature, the endothelium is the thin layer of endothelial cells and underlying nanofibrillar basement membrane that modulates vascular tone by release of soluble factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial dysfunction or the injury of endothelium is a hallmark of vascular diseases. The inevitable injury to this multifunctional endothelium associated with stent deployment triggers the cascade of restenosis and thrombosis.  The goal of this application is to demonstrate the prohealing effects of the novel multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent, which will minimize the risks of late stent thrombosis, restenosis, inflammatory responses, and incomplete endothelialization. The overall hypothesis of this application is that the prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix can enhance the efficacy of the stent by promoting endothelial healing on the surface of the stent.  Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the synergistic prohealing effects of multiple components of the endothelium mimicking, self-assembled nanomatrix. Specific Aim 2: To determine the influence of hemodynamics on the prohealing multifunctional endothelium nanomatrix coated stent using a rabbit artery simulating bioreactor.

with distal constant region gene elements to generate class switched antibodies that exhibit the same antigenic
specificity, but have the ability to perform distinct effector functions required for mediating an optimal immune
response against pathogens. Expression of the adaptor protein HSH2 is tightly regulated in B cell
subpopulations in the periphery. High-level full length HSH2 expression is observed in innate like B cells
(marginal zone and B1a/b B cells) that do not undergo class switching. Conversely, low-level full length HSH2
expression is observed in follicular and germinal center B cells that ultimately generate class-switched antibody
secreting cells. Analysis of mouse models expressing high versus low levels of HSH2 have demonstrated that
the expression of HSH2 inversely correlates with the production of class-switched antibody secreting cells and
class-switched antibody in response to challenge with model antigens. The scientific premise of the
proposed studies is that regulation of HSH2 expression plays a critical role in controlling the
production of class-switched ASCs and Abs, and that delineation of the molecular mechanisms that
regulate HSH2 expression are highly significant with respect to understanding how the humoral
immune response is regulated. Two specific aims are proposed in this application. Because preliminary
studies have shown that HSH2 expression is regulated via a post-translational mechanism mediating its
turnover, experiments in Specific Aim 1 will be performed to analyze the B cell degradome, transcriptome and
proteome to identify the protease responsible for rapid degradation of HSH2 in B cells. These studies have the
potential to identify a novel post-translational regulatory process that plays a critical role in controlling the
production of class-switched antibodies. Specific Aim 2 will focus on structural and functional characterization
of LMW species of HSH2 that are uniquely expressed in germinal center B cells and that may play an
important role in regulating the germinal center response leading to production of class-switched antibodies.
Mass spectrometry will be used to characterize LMW species of HSH2, which will then be expressed via
retroviral transduction of stem cells and adoptive transfer experiments to assess their function during the
germinal center response following challenge with T-dependent antigen. The proposed studies are highly
significant with respect to the development of strategies to manipulate the humoral response to
enhance vaccine efficacy, as well as the humoral response against microbial pathogens.
!","HSH2 is an adaptor protein expressed in the peripheral B cell pool that regulates the production of class -
witched antibodies. Because high-level expression of HSH2 correlates with impaired production of class-
switched antibodies, whereas low-level expression leads to enhanced production, it is of significance to
determine the mechanisms that regulate HSH2 expression in B cells. These studies are highly significant with
respect to the development of strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy, to enhance the humoral response
against microbial pathogens and to attenuate autoimmune/allergic disease sequelae mediated by class
switched autoantibody production.",2019,222750,150000,72750,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS),LOUIS B JUSTEMENT
7R01AI110200-05,Gene-Engineered Stem Cell Memory T-Cells With Anti-HIV Chimeric Antigen Receptors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) transiently control HIV in infected persons, but eventually fail due to viral
mutation and other factors, resulting in persistent or chronic infection. However, reports of CTLs suppressing HIV
infection in a few patients indicate that overcoming these barriers would allow for successful CTL-mediated control
of HIV infection. Adoptive immunotherapy strategies aim to confer directed and enhanced CTL responses via
supplementation of ex vivo-expanded autologous CD8+ T cells expressing a desired antigen-specific T cell
receptor (TCR). However, these cells are mostly dysfunctional due to decreased proliferative response and limited
CTL activity. Moreover, the requirement for a particular human-leukocyte antigen to properly present antigen to
the T cell limits exogenous TCR-based approaches. Thus, such approaches have had minimal effects on reducing
HIV-viral load.
 Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are artificially engineered receptors that confer a desired specificity onto
immune effector T cells. In recent years, CAR immunotherapies have been extensively promoted in anti-cancer
clinical trials. Of these, adoptively transferred autologous T cells modified with anti-CD19 CAR showed a dramatic
impact on B cell lymphomas in acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We hypothesize that CAR
immunotherapy against HIV-infected cells can eradicate persistently infected cells and HIV latent reservoirs in
patients following reactivation. Regarding an anti-HIV CAR, CD4Î¶ CAR consisting of the extracellular domain of
the human CD4 molecule linked to the CD3Î¶-chain has been well-studied in vitro and in human clinical trials. This
CAR has been shown to mediate highly potent anti-HIV activity in vitro, but had limited effects due to poor survival
and functionality of the transduced cells. We considered potential reasons for this failure due to 1) susceptibility of
CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells expressing CD4Î¶ CAR to HIV infection, 2) lack of costimulatory signaling domains
required for proper effector and memory response, and 3) massive ex vivo expansion of T cells prior to gene
modification leading to cellular aging, resulting in poor effector and memory function.
 Our overall goal is to confer long-term, enhanced HIV-specific effector and memory responses via
transplantation of anti-HIV CAR-engineered T cells. We will 1) develop a new class of anti-HIV CAR using HIV-
targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies, 2) protect CAR-transduced T cells from HIV-mediated cytotoxicity by co-
transduction with anti-HIV genes, 3) introduce costimulatory-signaling domains into anti-HIV CAR to ensure
superior effector and memory responses, and 4) use newly identified memory T cells retaining stem cell properties
called â€œstem cell memory T (TSCM) cellsâ€ as a carrier vehicle for anti-HIV CAR. TSCM cells self-renew in vitro as well
as in vivo and differentiate into effector T cells. Thus, TSCM cells engineered to express HIV-specific CAR provide
an inexhaustible source of HIV-specific immune cells. These studies will be further modeled in vivo using the
humanized bone marrow, liver and thymus (BLT) mouse system.","RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH
The need for novel approaches toward the treatment of HIV-1 infection has never been greater as the number
of HIV-1 infected patients continues to increase despite decades of prevention efforts. In such circumstances,
the prospect of immunotherapy used anti-HIV CAR that will require â€œonly a single or few treatmentsâ€ is
especially compelling. Although I use AIDS as a model, this approach could be applied to many other human
diseases.",2019,327432,220493,106939,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,Masakazu  Kamata

1R43GM133232-01,A multiscale computational tool to simulate the PK of orally-administered drugs in the human GI tract,"A multiscale computational tool to simulate the PK of orally-administered drugs in the human GI tract
Project Summary/Abstract:
Most FDA approved drugs are administered orally, despite the complex process of oral drug absorption that is
difficult to analyze experimentally. Oral bioavailability is dependent on the interplay between multiple and
simultaneous processes that are dependent on both the drug compound as well as the physiological and
anatomical states of the user. Due to this complexity, computational models have emerged as a tool to
integrate these factors in an attempt to mechanistically capture and predict the process of oral absorption in a
robust and accurate manner. The current predictive models are generally 0D compartmental models and are
thus limited by simplified physiological characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), by semi-empirical or
specific analytical solutions of dissolution profiles, and by insufficient descriptions of interactions between
delivery vehicles and the GIT. In particular, the absorption can be incorrectly modelled using the 0D models for
(i) some drug classes (under the BCS scheme), (ii) for GIT, whose sizes are significantly different from the
median human and (iii) for drugs, that are meant to target specific regions (for instance, the drugs used to treat
some colon cancer) by incorrectly predicting the absorption in other regions. In this project, we propose to
develop an efficient and spatially accurate computational tool to simulate the dissolution, transport, Liberation,
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity (LADME-T) of orally administered drugs in the
human GIT at the enzyme, delivery-vehicle, intestine-tissue, and GIT levels. This will be further combined with
the compartmental model at the whole-body level to predict systemic pharmacokinetics. In Phase I, the multi-
scale computational tool will be constructed by integrating the spatially accurate first-principles driven high-
fidelity drug transport, dissolution and absorption model in the human stomach and GIT, mechanistic drug
release models, and the multi-layer intestine physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (lumen, enterocyte, and
blood layers) models. These will be accomplished using the recently demonstrated CFD Research
Corporationâ€™s spatially accurate Q3D framework. In Phase II, we will (i) test and validate the models for drug
transport and absorption physics for the 4 BCS classes of drugs, (ii) morph the GIT to create variants
corresponding to diseased specimens and different anatomical sizes, (iii) perform and validate the spatially
accurate drug absorption simulations for these new GIT variants, (iv) obtain the PK parameters and perform
the drug absorption simulations for infants and children, (v) link the Q3D GUT model to the whole body PK
model, and (vi) use this multiscale model, to optimize specific cases, including the drug delivery to target
regions. The multiscale software developed in this project will provide a powerful virtual platform in
investigating LADME-T, facilitating in vitro-in vivo scaling, designing and developing targeted oral drug delivery
systems, and evaluating safety and efficacy of oral drug products. Ultimately, the proposed tool will be
developed into a commercial product to meet urgent demands from pharmaceutical and biomedical industries.","Project Narrative:
The novel software tool proposed in this project will provide an efficient and spatio-temporally accurate
multiscale computational platform to virtually test, design, and develop oral drug products. This will be
achieved by investigating interactions between drug delivery systems and the human physiological systems

consequent therapeutic or toxic effects. The developed tool will meet urgent demands from pharmaceutical

1R21MH118492-01,Altered microRNA expression patterns in plasma extracellular vesicles from patients with first episode psychosis,"ABSTRACT
First-episode psychosis (FEP) represents a critical stage of illness during which therapeutic interventions are
believed to effectively influence long-term outcomes. Nonetheless, it is not clear what biological changes in the
brain underlie FEP and subsequent disease progression. Moreover, there are no established molecular
biomarkers that reflect psychosis and/or predict their longitudinal outcomes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
cell-derived microvesicles that contain various cellular components, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and
metabolites, from the donor cells and, by fusing with other cells, transfer these components between cells in a
paracrine and endocrine manner. An increasing body of evidence shows that EVs in the circulation may be
useful in detecting various brain disorders at early stage and predicting their clinical outcomes. In this study,
our goal is to evaluate the utility of EVs in the peripheral blood as molecular biomarkers to predict FEP and
their subsequent progression. Our preliminary studies with a small cohort of FEP patients and controls
suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) were differentially expressed in plasma EVs derived from FEP patients.
In parallel, our analysis of longitudinal changes in clinical/neurocognitive data of FEP patients identified
potential subgroups. In the proposed study, we will test our hypothesis that peripheral blood EV-associated
miRNAs (EV-miRNAs) will display changes reflecting clinical/neurocognitive data in FEP patients and their
subgroups. We will first extend our preliminary findings on differential plasma EV-miRNA expression in FEP
patients in a larger size of FEP patient and control samples, and then compare their profiles with those from
CSF EV (Aim 1). We will also examine the utility of EV-miRNAs to distinguish FEP patient subgroups by
combining unsupervised clustering of FEP patients based on longitudinal clinical/neurocognitive data changes
and their plasma EV-miRNA data (Aim 2). This study will generate an unprecedented dataset of altered EV-
miRNAs in the body fluids of FEP patients whose multimodal data are readily available. The findings will create
a foundation for future studies to determine the utility of EV-miRNAs to predict long-term consequences of
disease and potentially evaluate responsiveness to therapeutic interventions.","Project Narrative
Currently, there are established molecular biomarkers that predict psychosis and/or its clinical outcomes and

7R01MH113645-02,Impact of immune cell-derived exosomes and miRNAs on brain function and behavior,"ABSTRACT
Adaptive immune cells in the periphery (T and B cells) and innate immune cells in the brain (microglia) have
been implicated in the brain homeostasis in health and disease. Rodent studies using immunodeficient mice
have revealed that the loss of adaptive immune cells (T and B cells) led to impaired learning and memory,
anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired sociability. Nevertheless, it is not clear how adaptive immune cells
communicate with microglia and affect brain development and function. Our long-term goal is to understand
the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the communication between adaptive immune cells and
brain cells during brain development and in adulthood. Our preliminary studies revealed that Rag1-/- and [Rag2-
/-mice], lacking both T and B cells, exhibited impaired social behaviors. In Rag1-/- mice, increased c-Fos
expression and altered microglial phenotypes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were observed. This is
consistent with previous reports that mPFC dysfunction is involved in social behaviors. [Notably, adoptive
transfer of wild-type (WT) splenocytes (containing T and B cells) rescued Rag1-/- social behavioral deficits.
Further, injection of WT serum exosomes rescued the same phenotype. The social behavioral deficits were
also observed in Rag2-/- mice despite the fact that Rag2 is normally absent in the WT brain. Together, these
findings suggest that T and B cells contribute to social behaviors via exosomes.] Indeed, we observed that
exosomes from the sera of Rag1-/- mice lacked the expression of T and B cell markers and multiple microRNAs
(miRNAs) presumably derived from T and B cells. The expression of predicted target gene(s) of these
miRNAs, such as Ski, was enhanced in the PFC of Rag1-/- mice. In contrast, WT serum exosomes decreased
Ski expression in microglia. Recent studies showed that microglia control neuronal synapses. Thus, our data
suggest that deficient adaptive immune cell-microglia communication via exosomes impairs social behaviors
by altering mPFC function. Hence, in this study, we will test our hypothesis that the lack of adaptive immune
cell-derived exosomes and their miRNAs results in impaired social behaviors via altered microglial control of
neuronal function in the medial PFC. We will first validate and extend our findings on serum exosomes and the
mPFC neurons in Rag1-/- mice, and determine the causal role for the lack of adaptive immune cells by
restoring them back into Rag1-/- mice with adoptive transfer technique (Aim 1). We will also examine the direct
impact of impaired exosome release and miRNA production in adaptive immune cells on microglia and
neurons in the mPFC and social behaviors by genetic approaches (Aim 2). [In addition, we will address the
contribution of pyramidal neurons and microglia in the mPFC to impaired social behaviors (Aim 3).] This study
will reveal novel mechanisms whereby adaptive immune cell-derived exosomes influence brain function and
behavior and may eventually lead to novel therapeutic strategies in psychiatric disorders.","Narrative
Abnormalities in adaptive immune system are suggested as an underlying mechanism of psychiatric disorders
such as schizophrenia, depression, and autism spectrum disorders. This proposal outlines experiments

psychiatric disorders by targeting peripheral immune cells without directly accessing the brain.",2019,358558,250000,108558,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Mental Health; Neurosciences,Shinichi  Kano
7R01HL133896-03,DISPLACE: Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment,"Project Abstract
Ischemic stroke is a potentially preventable, devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of
inherited blood disorders that affect close to 100,000 individuals in the United States. Without intervention,
stroke may occur in up to 24% of individuals with the highest risk form of SCD, sickle cell anemia. Despite
improvements in comprehensive care and management of SCD in children, stroke remains a major cause of
morbidity and mortality due to insufficient screening and prevention practices. Individuals living with SCD
continue to face multiple health disparities cause by racial and socioeconomic factors as well as disease-
specific disparities in funding and private sector support. In order to standardize and improve care, the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released evidence-based guidelines in 2014. These guidelines
established routine transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) screening as a means for identifying children at high
risk of stroke and indefinite chronic red cell transfusions (CRCT) as a means of treating children at high risk for
stroke based on the previous NHLBI funded, randomized controlled STOP (Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle
Cell Disease) results. This proposal, entitled DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke
Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) is a multi-site effort focused on enhancing the implementation
and dissemination of these evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in SCD. The research approach is
guided by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and the multilevel
ecological model of health. The DISPLACE leadership core at the Medical University of South Carolina is a
multidisciplinary team lead by Dr. Julie Kanter, Dr. Robert Adams and Dr. Cathy Melvin and includes
specialists in multicenter clinical trial design, hematology, implementation science, qualitative analysis and
statistical evaluation. The Data Coordinating Unit (DCU) at MUSC who have coordinated over 40 multicenter
studies and will provide study design and information technology support and data management support the
leadership core. The aims of DISPLACE are to: 1) assess the gap between current and guideline-
recommended practices for stroke prevention among pediatric patients with SCD, 2) assess the multi-level
patient, provider, and systems barriers and enablers to performing TCD screening and initiating CRCT, and 3)
evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi-level dissemination and implementation strategy to increase current
annual TCD screening rates and CRCT initiation rates using a parallel cluster-randomized clinical trial. We
have assembled a large, multi-institutional collaboration of institutions with widespread geographic distribution
to best assess the feasibility and utility of the multi-level implementation strategy. The long-term goal of
DISPLACE is to ensure that all children with SCD receive guideline-based care for stroke prevention for a
â€œstroke free generationâ€ in SCD.","Project Narrative

1R21EB028063-01,Automated MRI-based 3D Contractility (Strain) Analysis for Detecting Subclinical Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy,"Project Summary
Chemotherapy has made remarkable advances in the treatment of solid malignancies which cure
millions of patients from breast cancer. However, the adverse effects of cardiotoxicity mediated
by dose-dependent chemotherapeutic agents (such as anthracyclines) limit the efficacy of these
therapies, causing left-ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the form of cardiomyopathies and even heart
failure. Emerging evidence now suggest that early, myocardial strain-based, subclinical detection
of cardiotoxicity may facilitate timely interventions in treatment management and therefore slow
the progress of LV dysfunction and lower the incidence of heart failure. Recent clinical studies also
show that the strain-based approach to detecting subclinical cardiotoxicity is superior to detections
based on measuring differentials in LV ejection fraction (LVEF).
The primary objective of this study is to create a highly automated, diagnostic application with an
intuitive user-interface for computation of MRI-based myocardial contractile metrics in the LV in
general, and to specifically use it in this study towards predicting the onset of subclinical
cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. A parallel and equally important goal will involve
demonstrating that regional contractile metrics (Lagrangian radial, circumferential and longitudinal
normal strains, circumferential-radial and circumferential-longitudinal shear strains as well as twist
and torsion) can predict cardiotoxicity prior to LVEF. Among the above mentioned 3D contractile
metrics monitored, there will be an emphasis on our main hypothesis that torsion, which
parameterizes the base-to-apex twisting motion of myofibers, is pivotal for indicating myocardial
dysfunction. The source of data for these metrics will be the cardiac motion (displacements)
recorded with the phase encoding MRI sequence of navigator-gated, spiral cine DENSE.
Ultimately, the originality of this study will lie in our ability to fully automate the contractility
measurement process including computations of 3D LV boundaries using a combination of image
quantization and phase-unwrapping the DENSE data, in addition to the pointwise computation of
the contractile metrics in a 3D myocardial grid of the patientâ€™s LV using the DENSE displacements.
The surveillance in each patient will be conducted at baseline (initiation of chemotherapy) and
during regular follow-up investigations to determine the role that regional strain-based contractile
metrics may have in detecting subclinical cardiotoxicity prior to LVEF. If established, the proof of
concept for this early detection will be provided with intra-parametric and inter-parametric analysis
of variance models, within and between the regional contractile metrics and LVEF and their
correlations to clinical data conducted after two follow-up investigations performed on the enrolled
chemotherapy patients.
The ultimate goal is that this novel, contractility-based surveillance tool can provide cardio-
oncologists with the direct ability to diagnose subclinical cardiotoxicity induced by
chemotherapeutic agents and hence, the opportunity to intervene with cardio-protective therapy
towards better treatment management.","Project Narrative
The aim of this study is to implement an automated, diagnostic application with a clinically intuitive
interface for the computation of MRI-based contractile metrics (Lagrangian strains, twist and
torsion) in the entire 3D left-ventricular myocardium. Specifically for this study, this tool will be
used for detecting early-onset, subclincal myocardial damage caused by chemotherapeutic
agents (such as anthracyclines) in breast cancer patients. In this regard, one of the specific
hypothesis tested will be to verify if torsion formulated from a combination of circumferential and
longitudinal normal strains and circumferential-longitudinal shear strain detect subclinical
dysfunction in the myocardium in advance of left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Periodic,
intra-parametric and inter-parametric analysis of variance tests on high-resolution, MRI
displacement-encoding based measurements of torsion, twist, 3D normal and shear strains and
LVEF as well as correlating these parameters to clinical data will demonstrate whether the strain-
based contractile parameters detect early-onset cardiotoxicity (prior to LVEF), and hence provide
clinicians with the advantage to intervene treatment regimens towards better cardiac protection.",2019,208194,150000,58194,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,366880002,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease,Julia  Kar
7R01CA219495-03,Inhibin function in tumor angiogenesis,"Ovarian cancer is among the most devastating of gynecological cancers primarily impacting postmenopausal
women. Induction of angiogenesis, the process of generating and remodeling blood vessels, is a critical
requirement for tumor growth and metastasis in multiple cancers including ovarian, leading to the use anti-
angiogenic agents in the clinic. However side effects and toxicities can limit their use. Thus there remains a
need to identify cancer specific, safe ways to control angiogenesis in ovarian cancer. Inhibin is a unique TGF-Î²
family member whose levels are extremely low in normal post-menopausal women. However Inhibin is an
established biomarker for ovarian cancers with unknown functions. Our preliminary studies show that Inhibin
expression is regulated by hypoxia, a well-appreciated regulator of tumor angiogenesis. We find that Inhibin
exhibits paracrine effects on the endothelium by increasing angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
Inhibin requires the endothelial specific receptors Endoglin and Alk1 to induce angiogenesis. Since Inhibin is
expressed in ovarian cancers, but present at low systemic levels in normal post-menopausal women we will
examine Inhibin as a potential novel angiogenic target for cancer the mechanism of action. The hypothesis to
be tested is that blocking tumoral Inhibin, a novel ligand for endothelial specific TGF-Î² receptors, and a product
of the hypoxia adaptive response that promotes angiogenesis will result in suppression of tumor angiogenesis.
The specific aims are: 1) To test if blocking Inhibin has therapeutic anti-angiogenic effects in ovarian cancer
alone or in combination with current anti-angiogenic therapies. 2) To delineate the mechanism of Inhibin
induced endothelial cell remodeling and angiogenesis using a combination of cell signaling, biochemical and
biophysical approaches to test Inhibin as a direct novel ligand for endothelial receptors endoglin and Alk1 and
identify novel signaling targets of Inhibin using transcriptomics. 3) To define hypoxia mechanisms regulating
Inhibin expression. I believe that these investigations into Inhibin-mediated angiogenesis will provide the first

1K99HL144817-01A1,The role of endothelin-1 in tubular injury in sickle cell disease,"1Â  Project Summary/Abstract
 2Â  Mentored Phase: Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most common hemoglobinopathy in US, is associated with
 3Â  high prevalence of end-stage kidney failure at the median 23 years of age. Due to the lack of kidney-targeted
 4Â  treatment the mean survival is less than 3 years. SCD milieu induces endothelin-1 (ET-1) and elevated ET-1
 5Â  levels in SCD patients correlate with microalbuminuria. I recently demonstrated that both ET receptor A (ETA)
 6Â  and dual ET receptor A and B (ETA+B) antagonists prevented the increase in glomerular permeability to albumin
 7Â  in a mouse model of SCD, but only the ETA receptor antagonist prevented albuminuria. These findings led me
 8Â  to the hypothesis that ET-1 via ETA receptor activation contributes to renal injury in SCD mice, while the ETB
 9Â  receptor provides tubular protection. Thus, the central hypothesis of the mentored phase is that in the SCD
10Â  milieu, elevated ET-1 and increased ETA receptor activity mediate tubular dysfunction leading to the
11Â  tubular injury in SCD mice, which is opposed by the ETB activity. The specific aim 1 of the mentored
12Â  phase will determine if increased ET-1 and the ETA receptor activity mediate tubular injury by decreased
13Â  tubular albumin uptake mechanism in SCD mice and if ETB receptor antagonism exacerbates ET-1 effects on
14Â  tubular albumin handling. With the use of new training in in vivo imaging techniques, I will track fluorescent-
15Â  labeled albumin to assess tubular albumin reabsorption in vehicle- or ET receptor antagonists treated SCD and
16Â  genetic control mice. We will also determine the direct effect of ET-1 and ET receptors on proximal tubule
17Â  albumin transporters in ex vivo and in vivo settings. Independent Phase: This phase will focus on an
18Â  independent line of investigation exploring mechanisms of renal iron handling that builds on previous training.
19Â  Evidence suggests that increased iron deposition in SCD is associated with albuminuria, both of which can be
20Â  attenuated by ETA receptor blockade. Although, ET-1 contributes to glomerulopathy in SCD, the relevance of
21Â  iron-induced toxicity and resultant tubular injury is unclear. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of the
22Â  independent phase is that elevated ET-1 leads to dysfunctional tubular iron handling, iron overload, and
23Â  tubular injury in SCD. This will be tested through in vitro experiments on cultured proximal tubules cells and
24Â  in vivo in SCD mice. The specific aim 2 will determine if impaired tubular iron handling in SCD leads to iron
25Â  overload via ET-1 induced increase in proximal tubule iron uptake and/or decrease in proximal tubule iron
26Â  removal. The specific aim 3 will determine mechanisms of iron toxicity that lead to tubular injury in SCD. This
27Â  will be tested by determining if renal iron-overload leads to tubular injury via oxidative stress and/or
28Â  mitochondrial dysfunction in SCD nephropathy. The goals of the proposed studies will undoubtedly shed light
29Â  on novel mechanistic pathways involved in the development and progression of tubular injury, a crucial
30Â  contributor in chronic kidney disease.","Project narrative

1U19AI142737-01,Development and maintenance of human glycan and phospholipid antibody repertoires,"Project 1: Development and maintenance of human glycan and phospholipid antibody repertoires
Project Summary
Natural antibodies (nAbs) exist in the blood of multiple mammalian species in the absence of deliberate
immunization. Reactivity of nAbs with epitopes conserved between pathogens and autologous host antigens
allow these antibodies to perform dual functions in immunity: providing important host defense against infection
and facilitating housekeeping functions important for tissue homeostasis. The mechanisms controlling human
nAb development and maintenance, however, are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to define
mechanisms controlling maturation of the human natural B lymphocyte repertoire and its tissue distribution. We
will achieve this goal by completing a targeted analysis of B cells reactive with conserved carbohydrate and
phospholipid T lymphocyte-independent antigens associated with clinically relevant bacteria and xenoantigens.
Through this approach, we will test our central hypothesis that the selection of innate-like B cell clonotypes and
antigen-specific tuning of the nAb-producing B cell repertoire depend on interactions with autologous antigens
and microbial antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces, which together modulate the entry of B cell clonotypes
into the memory and antibody-secreting B cell compartments. In the first Specific Aim, we will sort-purify single,
indexed carbohydrate- and phospholipid-binding B cells from a cohort of cadaveric human tissue donors.
Immunoglobulin gene expression in these B cells will be analyzed together with expressed cellular phenotype to
determine the distribution of clonal networks of nAb-producing B cells across B cell compartments in multiple
human tissues. We will additionally examine the stability of innate-like B cell clonotypes and specificity of nAb
repertoire by longitudinally sampling human blood after anti-CD20 (rituximab) B cell depletion, to determine the
extent of antigen-reactive clonal B cell extirpation and clonal repertoire recovery during B cell compartment
regeneration. Specific Aim 2 will utilize a novel, high-throughput antibody-cloning and expression platform to
express immunoglobulin gene rearrangements from gene amplicon libraries as recombinant Abs and examine
their binding properties, including antigen affinity and fine specificity. We will additionally examine the effects of
somatic mutation on the binding properties of nAb by assessing the global reactivity of cloned antibodies and
germline-reverted clonotypes using mammalian glycan antigen microarrays. This targeted analysis of antigen-
reactive human B cells will permit analysis of fine antigen-specificity, affinity, and avidity of B cell clonotypes
across human tissues, and the determination of whether these features of the BCR influence the tissue, B cell
subset, and immunoglobulin isotype distribution of certain clones. Because nAb antigens are expressed by
multiple commensal and pathogenic organisms and are protective in normal immune homeostasis, such findings
will facilitate the development of immunotherapies designed to intersect the natural repertoire.",,2019,338507,228245,110262,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Transplantation,John Franklin Kearney
5U01AI100005-08,Effects of neonatal microbial exposure on anti-polysaccharide B cell development,"ABSTRACT
Innate-like B cell-derived natural antibodies (NAbs) against T-independent polysaccharide (PS) and
phospholipid epitopes are universally present in mammals and serve important roles in the protection against
many bacterial pathogens. However robust antibody responses against PS antigens following infection or
immunization are absent in neonates. We previously showed that neonatal exposure to PS and phospholipid
antigens by immunization or natural colonization with the microbiota, influences the clonal distribution of
antigen-specific innate-like B cells leading to quantitative increases in natural antibody (Nab) levels. These
effects impact adult susceptibility to infection, and immune-responsiveness to allergens and auto antigens
bearing similar B cell epitopes. Although the microbiota impacts the development of other lymphoid lineages its
role in the development of the adult innate-like B cell and NAb repertoires is largely unexplored. Our
hypothesis is that in addition to the well-described selection processes that occur during B cell development,
the accessibility to autologous antigens and exogenous commensal-derived epitopes combine during neonatal
development to shape the natural repertoire. The goal of these proposed studies is to elucidate mechanisms of
exogenous antigen-directed development of the innate-like B cell repertoire using three model B cell antigen-
specificities that represent epitopes for relevant pathogenic and commensal organisms with a spectrum of auto
antigenic potential: phosphorylcholine (PC), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and dextran (DEX). In Aim 1 of
these studies wild-type gnotobiotic mice will be colonized with defined microbiota to assess the contribution of
exogenous antigen signaling on clonal B cell development and formation of the NAb repertoire. Bone marrow
chimera systems, composed of antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain-transgenic mouse strains,
and lineage tracking will enable assessment of endogenous and exogenous antigen signaling on B lymphocyte
selection and receptor editing processes. In Aim 2 we will analyze the frequency, cell surface phenotype,
subset and isotype distribution as well as immunoglobulin gene usage of human B cells specific for these
antigens. Examination of B cells isolated from cord blood, tonsils/adenoids, and peripheral blood B cells of
donors of different ages will provide novel insight into the role of antigen experience in the formation of innate-
like B cell repertoire diversity within and across individuals. Antigen-specific Ig genes will be cloned and
expressed as recombinant antibody to determine effects of antigen-driven maturation on functions of these
human antibodies. Collectively, these studies will define the microbial influences on NAb development in mice,
determine developmental kinetics of human NAb development, and compare and contrast the NAb repertoire
development between both species. This insight into the human infant responses to infection and colonization
will advance our long-term goal of developing effective neonatal vaccine strategies and interventional therapies
that provide protection from infectious pathogens and allergic and autoimmune diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The establishment of B cell clones in mice and humans depends on the timing and nature of antigen
exposure. Perturbations by natural antigen exposure from the environment and microbiota not only impact
B cell-mediated resistance to bacterial infections, but also suppress the development of allergic airway
diseases and autoimmune diabetes. Understanding of the mechanisms controlling the plasticity of the
neonatal repertoire will lead to new therapeutic or vaccination options for the treatment and prevention of
these diseases.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Biodefense; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Pediatric; Prevention; Vaccine Related,John Franklin Kearney

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that is potentially life-threatening and an increasingly significant public-health problem. In the United States, 16.4 million non-institutionalized adults and 7 million children currently have asthma, accounting for 7.3% and 9.4% of these total populations respectively. A major problem in fighting asthma is that it has multiple etiologies; however, there is a clear association of immune
allergies in about 40% of asthmatics, and as the prevalence of allergies has increased, so has asthma. The ""hygiene hypothesis"" attempts to link the increasing allergic phenomena to excessively sanitary conditions early in life, and polarization of CD4+ T helper cells defaulting toward TH2 cytokine-polarized responses. Despite the appeal of this hypothesis, there are few empirical data supporting beneficial effects of microbial exposure. Furthermore, despite the highly critical contributions of B cells and their antibody products to both immune and to para-immune conditions and to physiological homeostasis, little attention has been paid to the effects of early microbial exposure on the B cell antigen-recognition repertoire prior to allergic airway disease onset. Our long-term goal is to understand the link between early microbe exposure and protection from allergic airway diseases. In the previous grant period we produced compelling experimental evidence that manipulation of B cell repertoires by perinatal exposure to bacterial vaccines expressing conserved polysaccharide antigens resulted in antibody dependent dampening of adult development of allergic airways disease associated with Aspergillus fumigatus. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that B cell clones arising in early life and reactive to conserved bacteria-associated antigens have the potential to prevent sensitization to allergenic moieties associated with allergy-associated organisms expressing these conserved antigens. In three specific aims, we will identify: (i) mechanisms shaping the antibody repertoire by common environmental organisms, (ii) mechanisms involved in antibody-dependent inhibition of sensitization by allergens expressed by house dust mites and fungi, and (iii) strategies to enhance local protective antibody production at sites of allergen exposure. Outcomes from these aims will reveal new information about B cell repertoire plasticity and define developmental windows within which B cell clonal development can be manipulated to maximize levels of allergic airway-protective antibodies. Underlying this approach is our long-range goal to understand immunological mechanisms involved in protection against the development of allergic airway disease and provide new therapeutic or vaccination options for treatment and prevention of allergic asthma.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of asthma, along with other auto-immune related diseases, is increasing in western-style societies. Based on the intense antibody response to bacterial polysaccharides in humans and in our mouse models, we will investigate the modulating role of anti-Group A streptococcus and other bacteria-reactive B cells on the development and progression of allergic airway disease. New knowledge obtained from these studies will assist in the development of treatments, including a vaccination approach, that will prevent or dampen the allergy-associated processes that cause asthma.",2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Asthma; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Health Effects of Indoor Air Pollution; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Prevention; Vaccine Related,John Franklin Kearney
5P01CA210946-03,Project 3: Molecular Targets of Rexinoid Action in Skin,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
 The incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer is increasing worldwide and it is especially high in the solid
organ transplant population. These cancers are associated with a high morbidity in this population and, thus, it
represents a significant public health burden. Systemic retinoids have proven to be effective for the
chemoprophylaxis of non-melanoma skin cancers. They act by activating the transcription of RXR/RAR target
genes, but their exact cancer chemopreventive mechanism is still not clear because retinoids have pleiotropic
effects. The major limitation to the use of synthetic RAR agonists (acitretin, isotretinoin) at the doses required for
skin cancer prevention, is poor tolerance due to headaches, musculoskeletal symptoms, hyperlipidemia,
mucocutaneous inflammation and hepatotoxicity. The first clinically approved RXR agonist, bexarotene, is better
tolerated than retinoids. However, hyperlipidemia induced by oral bexarotene is a major problem.
 Drs. Muccio and Atigadda (Project 2 and Core 2) have designed a selective RXR agonist, UAB30, which
effectively prevents epithelial cancers (mammary, skin, etc.) but does not increase serum triglycerides in rodents
or humans. While UAB30 clearly shows promise as a safe and effective chemopreventive drug, its mechanism
of action at the molecular level is poorly understood. Our preliminary data indicate that treatment with UAB30
results in increased levels of ATRA in human skin epidermis. We propose that UAB30 potentiates the
transcriptional activity of existing endogenous ATRA mediated by RXR/RAR heterodimers, which induce
upregulation of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of ATRA. This leads to elevated levels of ATRA and
further increase in transcriptional activity of RXR/RAR heterodimers. We also propose that the amplitude of
upregulation of ATRA target genes serves as a good indicator of the potency of rexinoids for chemoprevention
of non-melanoma skin cancer. Finally, we propose that evaluation of the UAB30 analogs based on their ability
to induce ATRA signaling in epidermis can lead to development of the next generation of rexinoids with efficacy
comparable to bexarotene but without its toxicity. These hypotheses will be tested by defining the molecular
targets and studying the mechanism of action of UAB30 in epidermis using the dominant-negative mutant of
RXRÎ± and metabolic assays of retinoid metabolism (Aim 1); by characterizing the effect of UAB30 on skin cancer
and markers of cell differentiation and proliferation using our novel model of human squamous cell carcinoma
and mouse models of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma developed by Dr. Athar (Core 3); and
by evaluating the next generation of UAB30 analogs for their potency in upregulation of ATRA target genes
relative to UAB30 and bexarotene (Aim 3). These studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism of
UAB30 action in epidermis, and are critical for developing the next generation of highly effective and safe
rexinoids for chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancers in organ transplant recipients, and potentially for
other malignancies and skin diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE.

1R34MH118044-01A1,PrEP Demonstration Project among Women at Risk for HIV Infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African-American (AA) women living in the Deep South are 10 times more likely to be infected with HIV than
white women. Traditional HIV prevention methods, including STI/HIV education, comprehensive behavioral
interventions, and provision of condoms have rendered minimal success in this population. HIV pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) has become a promising biomedical prevention tool, with over 90% efficacy as shown in
numerous trials. PrEP has the potential to curb incident HIV infection among at-risk women; however,
biomedical HIV prevention work in the US has generally focused on men who have sex with men, often
leaving women (particularly women of racial/ethnic minority status) underserved, and a disparity with respect
to HIV infection inadequately addressed. Implementation science projects are urgently needed to evaluate
and overcome barriers to PrEP awareness, uptake, adherence, and persistence in this population. The
objective of this application is to increase PrEP uptake among AA women at-risk for HIV-infection in the rural
South, specifically those seeking care at Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC) in rural Alabama.
We will use a mixed-methods approach to adapt and pilot test a patient-provider communication tool from the
CDC PrEP toolkit that focuses on the first three steps of the PrEP cascade (e.g., recognizing HIV risk,
identifying as a PrEP candidate, and interested in PrEP) to increase PrEP uptake via referrals to local PrEP
clinics. Specifically, we propose: (1) to explore the HIV risk perceptions of AA women with recent PrEP use
(N=15-25), AA women who are candidates for PrEP (N=15-25), and providers (N=20) and identify
preferences around patient-provider communication about HIV risk and PrEP services that address the
needs of AA women; (2A) To systematically adapt a patient-provider communication tool to increase PrEP
uptake at two FQHCs in rural Alabama, using an iterative implementation process; and (2B). To assess the
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the patient-provider communication intervention on PrEP
uptake among AA women and their providers in a pilot pre-/post-intervention design (N=250). As part of aim
2B), we will also systematically document and evaluate reasons for declining a PrEP referral, reasons for
incomplete referrals, reasons for failing to initiate PrEP after a successful referral, and ongoing PrEP use at
3/6 months post PrEP initiation among our sample. The proposed work will significantly contribute to our
understanding of factors impacting PrEP uptake and use among AA women at high-risk for HIV-infection,
particularly in underserved, rural areas in the Deep South that are increasingly impacted by the HIV epidemic
and have worse health outcomes relative to other areas in the US. The results of this work will also directly
contribute to a full-scale, R01-level cluster randomized implementation trial in which we will measure the
effectiveness and cost associated with a PrEP services delivery intervention serving AA women at-risk for
HIV-infection in primary care and reproductive health centers in rural areas of the Deep South.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
African American women (AA), particularly those living in the rural southeastern United States, remain
persistently at risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) is a highly effective HIV
prevention tool that may circumvent barriers to the use of traditional HIV prevention tools, such as condom

5T32CA229102-02,Surgical Oncology Research Training Program,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over the last three decades, we have witnessed an explosion in the understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying human disease. However, out of this knowledge has come a relatively small number of
successful novel therapies. Historically, surgical oncologists have played an essential role in the advancement
of cancer-directed therapies. Additionally, health services research is increasingly important to optimizing care
of surgical oncology patients. However, surgeon participation in research efforts has been seriously challenged
by ever growing surgical training demands and the complexity of the current health care environment. More
than ever it is critical that we make rigorous scientific training an integral part of our surgical training programs.
The principal focus of the Surgical Oncology Research Training Program at the University of Alabama-
Birmingham (UAB) is to strengthen academic surgical oncology research training by stimulating interested
physician-scientists to pursue translational and health services research training in oncology. Only one other
program of this nature exists in the Deep South and as a result, residents in the 19 general surgery
residency programs in the Deep South are steered toward other funded fields of research training.
 The overall program goal of the Surgical Oncology Research Training Program is to provide surgical
residents, who are strongly motivated toward a career in surgical oncology, with a comprehensive, mentored
research experience. The specific objectives of this program are to: 1) provide training in the conduct of basic,
translational and health services surgical oncology research through participation in an individual and tailored
didactic and mentoring program utilizing the extensive resources of the UAB Department of Surgery, UAB
Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC), the School of Medicineâ€™s Center for Clinical and Translational Science
(CCTS), the Office of Postdoctoral Education (OPE), and an abundance of health services and disparities
research programs and centers; 2) develop surgeon-scientists and leaders in academic surgery with an
emphasis on surgical oncology; and 3) expand the pool of surgeon-scientists who will be competitive for future
research career development and independent research grants. The application includes a pool of successful,
experienced trainers from a variety of surgical oncology-related disciplines with research in the following focus
areas: cancer etiology and progression, exposure biology, experimental therapeutics, chemoprevention,
disparities in cancer outcomes and survivorship. Program leaders have significant past experience with
research training programs. The program addresses the evolving field of surgical oncology research through
the inclusion of training options in biostatistics and bioinformatics, genomics and disparities. Through its robust
cancer research environment and commitment to training, UAB and the UAB Department of Surgery provide
an optimal home for this needed program.","NARRATIVE
Surgeon participation in innovative and translational research efforts has been seriously challenged. Surgical

academic surgical oncology.",2019,297482,276780,20702,"Training, Institutional",T32,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer,Gregory Dean Kennedy
5R01AG057684-03,In Silico Screening of Medications for Slowing Alzheimer's Disease Progression.,"Drug development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires a considerable investment of time and re-
sources, often with little reward as the vast majority of medications ultimately prove unsuccessful. Drug repur-
posing, in which medications that already have been approved for treatment are evaluated for therapeutic effects
in other disorders, has the potential to markedly increase the number of agents in the drug development pipeline
but requires methods for effective screening of candidate medications for activity. In silico or computational ap-
proaches to medication screening are rapidly growing, and have been successful in illnesses such as cancer,
but their application to AD remains understudied. There is also intense interest in drug repurposing approaches
that will utilize the vast amounts of clinical data that are being collected from epidemiological studies and clinical
encounters documented through electronic health records (EHRs). In this proposal, we present a novel approach
to drug repurposing that uses large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms applied to concurrent
medication taken by participants in AD clinical trials and in Medicare administrative data to determine which of
these medications show potential therapeutic beneï¬ts. With over 30 years of AD clinical trial data available to us
through a recently developed meta-database and 10 years of prescription data available through Medicare Part
D, the administration of concurrent medications to patients as part of their routine clinical care constitutes a large-
scale natural experiment. This information can be harnessed for AD treatment discovery if appropriate methods
can be developed to detect effects on disease progression within this high-dimensional data. Data mining al-
gorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well
suited to application in large-scale screening for drug repurposing. Using our meta-database and Medicare data,
we will be able to evaluate most of the more than 6,000 currently available prescription medications for efï¬cacy
in AD using well-accepted endpoints for measuring disease progression. The discovery phase will be followed
by a validation phase of promising candidate medications in independent data sets, as well as identiï¬cation of
plausible gene targets for each medication from the biomedical literature. This study will set the groundwork for a
series of follow-up in vivo studies to conclusively demonstrate effects of selected medications for AD, expanding
the current armamentarium for treating this common and debilitating disorder.","In this proposal, we will explore drug repurposing, in which medications approved to treat
other illnesses are evaluated for potential beneï¬ts in Alzheimer's disease (AD), to improve the efï¬ciency of the
drug development process, which currently ends in failure for most candidate medications despite considerable
investment of both time and resources. We will apply data mining, or pattern recognition, algorithms to the
concomitant medications taken by subjects in previous AD clinical trials that are part of our meta-database of
more than 6,500 individuals and by participants in Medicare Part D with more than 787,000 individuals. This
approach will allow us to screen hundreds of drugs for effects in slowing the progression of AD, which will guide
future clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents.",2019,645978,482787,163191,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,RICHARD E KENNEDY; LON S SCHNEIDER
1R01AG060993-01,Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,"Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost
of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now
recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term
cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional
methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In
this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e.,
pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic
health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction.
We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for
Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for
all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece-
dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of
our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than
testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of
delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual
features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as-
sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors
of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then
use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that
can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the
foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are
unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological
investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and
debilitating disorder.","Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu-
ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to
75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir-
ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time-
and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog-
nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing
computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",2019,432969,303058,129911,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety,RICHARD E KENNEDY
1F31DK121414-01,Illuminating novel roles for the Ldb1 co-regulator in transcriptional regulation of brown adipose function,"Project Summary/Abstract
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is critical for thermogenesis and glucose/lipid homeostasis. BAT utilizes fatty acids
and glucose for heat production via mitochondrial uncoupling and is thus an attractive therapeutic target for
combatting obesity. Exploiting the unique energy uncoupling capacity of this tissue requires a greater
understanding of underlying BAT transcriptional mechanisms. We recently reported on a transcriptional co-
regulator, LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1), which appears to have novel roles in BAT biology. Ldb1 acts
as a dimerized scaffold allowing for the assembly of transcriptional complexes and is important for the
development and function of many metabolic tissues, including the brain and pancreatic islets. However, direct
roles for BAT-expressed Ldb1 have not been elucidated. I will test the hypothesis that Ldb1 directly impacts
BAT function. Ldb1 deletion in isolated preadipocytes resulted in reduced Ucp1 expression upon induction to
mature adipocytes. Additionally, I developed a mouse model which deleted Ldb1 in thermogenic adipocytes
using a Ucp1-driven Cre recombinase, termed Ldb1Î”BAT. These knockout mice have reductions in BAT-
selective mRNAs including Ucp1 and Elovl3, a result similarly observed in an X9 beige cell line lacking Ldb1.
Ldb1Î”BAT mice were unable to defend body temperature during a cold challenge, suggesting thermogenic
defects. We also observed glucose intolerance in Ldb1Î”BAT mice via intraperitoneal glucose challenge. To
dissect the role of Ldb1 in regulating whole-body physiology, Ldb1Î”BAT will be assessed for changes in energy
expenditure, respiratory quotient, thermogenesis, feeding behavior, locomotor activity, and fuel utilization using
the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System. Glucose metabolism will be monitored through changes in
fasting blood glucose, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance with BAT-agonist treatment, insulin tolerance test, and
insulin signaling. To determine how the loss of Ldb1 affects brown adipocyte function, lipid content will be
assessed via Oil Red O staining and quantitative real-time PCR for lipogenesis markers. BAT histology will
determine changes to cell size and lipid content. Cellular respiration measurements will determine changes in
mitochondrial function, fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic flux. To elucidate the global transcriptional role of
Ldb1 in BAT gene expression, Ldb1Î”BAT mice will be crossed with a NuTRAP reporter mouse (termed
Ldb1Î”NuBAT) to allow sorting of adipocyte nuclei and mRNA. These sorted fractions will be examined for global
transcriptional changes via RNA-Seq, and bound targets via ChIP-Seq, with the results prioritized based on
genes associated with thermogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Results from
this proposal will inform future studies assessing Ldb1 roles in BAT under metabolic stresses, like high-fat diet
(HFD) as well as elucidating novel Ldb1-interacting transcriptional regulators. Outcomes from this proposal and
future HFD studies will enhance our understanding of transcriptional mechanisms maintaining BAT function
under basal and metabolic stress conditions, which will benefit future obesity therapies.","Project Narrative
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an attractive target for the treatment of obesity, an ever-growing disease
resulting in whole-body metabolic dysregulation. To exploit BAT energy-dissipating capacity, we need a greater
understanding of transcriptional mechanisms governing tissue function. This proposed research will reveal
novel transcriptional regulators required to maintain BAT function, illuminating targets that will improve obesity
therapies. !

1UG3CA232820-01A1,Disposable Perfusion Phantom for Accurate DCE-MRI Measurement of Pancreatic Cancer Therapy Response,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this study is to validate a UAB-invented perfusion phantom named P4 (Point-of-care
Portable Perfusion Phantom) for accurate DCE-MRI measurement of pancreatic tumor response to
neoadjuvant therapy. DCE-MRI has been utilized to noninvasively assess early therapeutic response in solid
tumors by detecting changes in tissue perfusion prior to anatomic tumor shrinkage. However, measurement
variability across different scanners remains a major concern in multi-site trials of DCE-MRI. To address this
concern, we invented the P4 that is small enough to be imaged concurrently in the bore of a standard MRI
scanner with a patient, thus can serve as an internal reference to detect and correct the scanner-dependent
variation in quantitating DCE-MRI parameters. We have confirmed that the use of this device decreased
variability in DCE-MRI measurement to about 4%, although it was about 20% before correction. We now
hypothesize that the P4 can help identify early therapeutic response of pancreatic tumors in the neoadjuvant
setting. Pancreatic tumors are typically hypo-perfused, but we have recently demonstrated that the tumor
perfusion can be significantly increased after an effective chemotherapy. Choosing the more effective therapy
early is particularly important for patients with borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer, as an effective therapy
can downstage a tumor to allow curable surgery. Three specific aims are proposed as follows. Aim 1 (UG3-
1): Develop a disposable P4 that is concurrently imaged with a patient for improved accuracy and
reproducibility in quantitative DCE-MRI measurement. For routine and widespread clinical use, the phantom
should be ready-to-use, inexpensive and disposable. Injection molding methodology will be employed to
manufacture the disposable P4. Aim 2 (UG3-2): Develop a software package analyzing abdominal DCE-MRI
images obtained with the P4. Image processing will be conducted sequentially in eight steps. To date, we
have developed eight prototype software program modules (one for each step). In this study, we aim to
combine all eight modules for seamless data flow, while making each module automated/semi-automated not
only to reduce user bias but to improve speed of operation. The software front panel will be updated for more
efficient operation using feedback from multiple users. Aim 3 (UH3-1): Evaluate the changes of DCE-MRI
parameters as surrogate imaging biomarkers for pancreatic cancer therapy response in a multi-site setting
after error correction using the P4. A total of 50 patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer entering
neoadjuvant therapy will be recruited in two research institutes (n=25 per institute). The changes of DCE-MRI
parameters in tumors for 4 weeks after therapy initiation will be correlated with the therapeutic response
assessed by margin-negative resection rate after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, and evaluated as
surrogate biomarkers after P4-based error correction.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

pancreatic tumor response to therapy early and accurately in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance

1R41OD027206-01,A Portable Device for Accurate Mouse Tail Vein Injection,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
To date, the standard method to access a mouse tail vein is manual injection, but its yield rate is poor in
general. This leads to multiple needle insertions associated with tissue damage and pain. Besides, failure in
tail-vein injection leads to data loss, and thereby more animals will be required to compensate it. Finally, the
dose variation induced by unreliable injection increases errors in data quantification. Therefore, the
development of a portable and inexpensive device presenting high yield rate is imperative to improve animal
welfare and data quality and to reduce the total research cost.
The PI has recently invented a device to facilitate tail-vein injection in mice, named Mouse Tail-vein Injection
Needle Guide (MTING). MTING guides a needle to the lateral tail vein of a mouse using the relationship
between the tail diameter and the vein depth. MTING also contains a light emitting diode (LED) to visualize the
tail vein regardless of mouse skin color. Using MTING, the PI achieved 87% yield rate (13 out of 15 animals).
MTING is small and made of inexpensive materials, thus it can be globally affordable for routine preclinical
research.
However, proper training for hand posture and mouse-tail positioning is required for using MTING, thus its yield
rate can be still affected by the level of user training and experience. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to
upgrade MTING so that the high yield rate can be achieved regardless of training and experience level of
technicians. Three specific aims over a 12-month period are proposed as follows.
Aim 1: Develop mouse tail holders. Mouse-tail holders will secure the tail firmly, while yielding the appropriate
amount of pressure to dilate the vein. This is important especially when the animals are not anesthetized.
Aim 2: Develop an automatic illumination system. In the upgraded version, the LED will be turned on
automatically, only when the mouse tail is properly positioned. Therefore, the LED will function not only for
visualizing tail vein but also as an indicator of proper tail positioning.
Aim 3: Validate the upgraded device in preclinical settings. The MTING equipped with the new mouse tail
holders and automatic illumination system will be tested in three strains of laboratory mice: black, agouti, and
albino. Each mouse will be injected with green dye using the MTING (test group) or following the conventional
protocol (control group), and the yield rates achieved by two different methods will be statistically compared.
MTING will be also tested for blood withdrawal.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The goal of this study is to develop a device to facilitate tail-vein injection in mice (80% or higher yield rate).
This device will significantly increase animal welfare as well as improve data quality, while decreasing the total
research cost. This device will be a paradigm shift in mouse tail-vein injection for the global preclinical
research community.",2019,175264,123508,40290,SBIR/STTR,R41,NIH Office of the Director,"TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION PARTNERS, LLC",AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic For-Profits,352422509,,Harrison  Kim
5R01HL128695-04,Saturated Fatty Acid-induced Autophagy in Vascular Endothelium,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is associated with ectopic deposition of fats which lead to lipotoxicity and chronic inflammation in various tissues. The long term goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which saturated fatty acid (SFA) induce endothelial dysfunction and its consequences in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is initiated by the nucleation of membrane-like structure and encloses cargo (proteins, lipid, and organelles) in membranous structure (autophagosome), and subsequently the autophagosome fuses with lysosome forming autolysosome, in which final degradation of cargo material occurs. When the equilibrium between the autophagosome formation and degradation is not maintained, cells undergo stressful conditions that result in cellular damage, dysfunction, and cell death. We observed that SFA induces impaired lysosomal degradation (inhibition of autophagic flux). Cells treated with SFA show increased lipid droplets and pro-inflammatory responses that are associated with inhibition of autophagic flux. We recently generated endothelial specific autophagy gene 7 knockout mice (ATG7-EndKO) to examine the role of endothelial autophagy in endothelial function and nutrient metabolism. ATG7-EndKO mice fed low fat diet do not exhibit impaired glucose tolerance. However, high fat diet (HFD) fed ATG7-EndKO mice exhibit impaired glucose tolerance when compared with control HFD-fed mice. From these results, we hypothesized that endothelial autophagy plays a protective role in SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction and metabolic disorders. To address this hypothesis, we propose to test the following three specific aims. The first aim is to determine the mechanisms by which SFAs impair autophagic flux. We will identify the pathway(s) contributing to SFA-induced impairment of authopagic flux. The second aim is to determine whether impaired autophagy contributes to SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this aim is to understand the role of endothelial autophagy in NO bioavailability. The thir aims to determine whether impaired autophagy contributes to HFD- induced insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in vivo. The results will broaden the knowledge of the pathophysiological consequences of impaired endothelial autophagy in normal and metabolically stressed conditions. Accomplishment of these aims will contribute to understanding the novel mechanisms for SFA- induced endothelial dysfunction, and the role of endothelial autophagy in endothelial function and metabolic homeostasis. Thus, the results may help us to develop a novel therapeutic target to prevent and/or treat obesity-associated vascular complications and metabolism.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The project is to understand the mechanisms by which saturated fatty acid-induced endothelial dysfunction that contribute to insulin resistance and energy metabolism.

and diet, is recommended for the best treatment. However, the results are often unsatisfactory, and the effect is
only temporary. Both exercise and nitric oxide (NO) increase metabolic rate, which contributes to converting
white adipocyte to beige/brite adipocyte (browning of adipocyte) by increasing mitochondrial number and energy
production. This favorable move makes the body metabolize more fat and reduce fat mass. However, there is
no successful treatment available to improve age-associated cardiometabolic disorders. Since promotion of
â€œbrowningâ€ increases metabolic rate and improve cardiometabolic functions, enhancing â€œbrowningâ€ in a non-
invasive manner may be an efficient way of preventing age-associated cardiometabolic diseases. Our research
team developed biocompatible NO-releasing nanomatrix gel, which can release sustained levels of NO in vivo.
Therefore, implanting NO-releasing nanomatrx gel into white adipose tissue may induce browning of adipocyte.
We observed that cells incubated with NO-releasing nanomatrix gel induces brown-like adipocytes in vitro. From
these results, we hypothesize that SubQ administration of a NO-releasing nanomatrix gel is a novel
therapeutic strategy to treat age-related metabolic dysfunction by promoting browning of adipocytes.
To test the hypothesis; in the aim 1, we will determine the effect of subcutaneous (SubQ) administration of a NO-
releasing nanomatrix gel on obesity and insulin resistance in aged mice; in the aim 2, we will elucidate the
mechanisms by which NO-releasing nanomatrix gel enhances â€œbrowningâ€ AT. Completion of these aims will
provide a novel strategy to treat age-associated obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.","PROJECT NARATIVE

1U54AI150225-01,Valacyclovir Phase I Trial,"This study, A Phase I Adaptive, Multiple Dose Pharmacokinetic and Safety Assessment of Valacyclovir in
Infants at Risk of Acquiring Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Disease, is led by David W. Kimberlin, MD.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare cause of disease in neonates, but when it occurs the results frequently
are devastating. Despite important advances over the past thirty years in the treatment of neonatal HSV
disease, significant numbers of babies die or are left with lifelong neurologic sequelae. While the
improvements in outcomes from antiviral interventions have been significant, the best mechanism of averting
death, neurologic damage, and emotional distress from neonatal HSV is to prevent the disease from occurring
in the first place.
Since 85% of babies developing neonatal HSV disease acquire the virus from their mothers during the birth
process, detecting which women are shedding HSV would allow a rational, targeted approach focusing on
those neonates at risk. To accomplish this, however, a simple, standardized, rapid test for detecting HSV in
the maternal genital tract at the time of delivery is required, and a therapeutic intervention that can be used in
neonates exposed to HSV to prevent HSV disease from developing is needed. In a major step toward
accomplishing such an approach, we have completed enrolling an NIH-funded study, in collaboration with
Cepheid Inc., to validate a novel point-of-care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using the company's
Xpert diagnostic platform for the detection of HSV DNA in vaginal swabs of pregnant women at delivery
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01878383).
While this study is an important diagnostic advance, our ultimate goal is to assess whether preemptive antiviral
treatment of babies exposed to HSV at delivery, as detected by Xpert PCR assessment of a maternal vaginal
swab, can prevent HSV exposure at delivery from progressing to neonatal HSV infection and thus to neonatal
HSV disease. To assess this, we will need to conduct a Phase III treatment study in neonates exposed to HSV
at delivery using oral valacyclovir (due to its superior oral bioavailability compared with oral acyclovir). Prior to
this, though, we need to know what dose of valacyclovir administered to neonates safely provides the targeted
acyclovir exposure that we identified previously in babies who already have acquired HSV infection. We
therefore will conduct a Phase I pharmacokinetic study through the Congenital and Perinatal Infections
Consortium (CPIC) to determine the optimal valacyclovir dose and thereby provide trial readiness for the next,
larger efficacy study.",,2019,290830,200872,89958,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Rare Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections",DAVID W KIMBERLIN

institutional cooperation â€“ focusing on rare congenital and perinatal viral infections â€“ to advance understanding
of these diseases, improve clinical trial readiness, test therapies, advance patient care, and ultimately reduce
disease burden. These infections include congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, neonatal herpes simplex
virus (HSV) infection, and neonatal viral sepsis caused by enteroviruses (EVs) and the related human
parechoviruses (HPeVs).
Led by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and supported by an experienced and
highly efficient study team, the 28 study sites that will comprise the CPIC have cooperated closely for decades
as the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group (CASG) to investigate the natural history and treatment of rare
congenital and perinatal infectious diseases. These longstanding relationships, as well as partnerships with
community and industry stakeholders, will facilitate the success of our research efforts and our mentored
career enhancement activities. As with all successful research programs, answers to critical questions always
lead to identification of the next important questions that will further advance the field. These questions are the
basis of the CPIC research portfolio that will advance the care of children with rare neonatal viral infections and
provide experiential mentored research opportunities as we train the future generation of rare diseases
researchers.
Aims of the CPIC are: 1) to build upon clinical research advances achieved by the CASG to further advance
the diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of HSV, CMV, and EV in the neonatal population; 2) to leverage
longstanding relationships across the 28 CPIC study sites and with stakeholders to conduct clinical research
projects with the highest of fidelity to all research standards; 3) to advance rare diseases research by sharing
standardized data through close partnership with the Data Management and Coordinating Center and by
utilizing cloud computing capacities and Common Data Elements; 4) to develop and utilize pilot and feasibility
funding to leverage existing institutional resources and maximize its impact on the advancement of the science
related to rare infectious diseases impacting neonates; and 5) to support mentored research and career
enhancement opportunities for clinical fellows and junior faculty to facilitate the development of early-stage

1U54AI150225-01,Letermovir Phase I Trial,"This project, A Phase I Adaptive, Escalating Single-Dose and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetic and Safety
Assessment of Letermovir in Infants with Symptomatic Congenital Cytomegalovirus Disease, is led by David
W. Kimberlin, MD. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading non-genetic cause of
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and the most frequent known viral cause of mental retardation, affecting
0.5% to 0.7% of live births in industrialized countries. With a U.S. birth cohort of 3.8 million annually, between
19,000 and 26,600 babies are estimated to be born each year with congenital CMV infection. Ten percent of
congenitally infected neonates have symptomatic disease at delivery, of whom 35% have SNHL, up to two-
thirds have neurologic deficits, and 4% die in the newborn period. SNHL occurs at a lower rate among the
90% of congenitally infected neonates who are asymptomatic at delivery, but because there are so many more
asymptomatic neonates than symptomatic ones the majority of cases of SNHL caused by CMV occurs in this
asymptomatic group.
The number of antiviral drugs with activity against CMV is very small, with only three active moieties approved
by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA): foscarnet (approved in 1991), ganciclovir (approved in 1994),
and cidofovir (approved in 1996). Valganciclovir, the L-valine ester of ganciclovir and therefore the same
moiety as ganciclovir, was approved in 2001. To date, all studies of the treatment of congenital CMV disease
have utilized ganciclovir or valganciclovir, and have documented a modest benefit of treatment on hearing and
developmental outcomes. In addition, we have found that patients with symptomatic congenital CMV disease
who achieve viral suppression to â‰¤ 2.5 log by day 14 of therapy and then maintain it over the next 4 months are
statistically more likely to have improved hearing across the first two years of life.
In November 2017, the FDA approved letermovir for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-
seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, making it the first new CMV drug in
over two decades. The availability of letermovir as a safe and effective antiviral drug with a completely
different mechanism of action from ganciclovir offers the opportunity to explore combination therapy. First,
though, the pharmacokinetics and safety of letermovir in neonates must be characterized. We propose to
perform a Phase I adaptive, multi-center, dose-escalation evaluation of single-dose and multiple-dose
administration of intravenous letermovir in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease to develop a safe
dosing regimen for neonates and young infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease.",,2019,255074,171767,83307,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Hearing Loss; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Patient Safety; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Rare Diseases",DAVID W KIMBERLIN
1U54AI150225-01,Administrative Core,"The mission of the Congenital and Perinatal Infections Consortium (CPIC) is to eliminate the disease burden
associated with rare pediatric viral diseases, focusing on congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, neonatal
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and neonatal enterovirus (EV) and parechovirus (HPeV) sepsis, by
gathering multi-site data to improve diagnosis, clinical trial readiness, and treatment of these rare diseases.
The proposed CPIC administrative structure builds on the infrastructure, as well as the success, of our well-
established Collaborative Antiviral Study Group (CASG).
The CPIC Administrative Core will provide oversight, coordination, and logistical support for the operation of
the proposed Consortium. The specific aims of the Core are to: 1) allocate and manage personnel and the
financial accounts related to CPIC activities, and provide fiscal oversight of all cores and projects; 2) develop
and implement policies and procedures to be used by CPIC sites related to research projects and CPIC Cores;
3) oversee and monitor all internal communication between CPIC sites and external communication with the
Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC); and
4) evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the overall CPIC, its research projects, and its cores.
We have carefully selected a coalition of 28 sites that individually and collectively bring knowledge of our
disease areas, experience collaborating on the development and implementation of research protocols, and
close partnerships with their patient populations. All have worked closely together for at least the past 10
years, and in many cases for up to 30 years. Throughout that time, UAB has provided scientific, regulatory,
trial management, biostatistical, laboratory, and data management support for all studies. This collaboration
has resulted in long-standing relationships, refinement of research and communication processes, and a
collective understanding of knowledge gaps among sites. Our team will be led by David Kimberlin, MD, CPIC
Principal Investigator (PI). He will be assisted by a Program Director and a Fiscal Manager within the UAB
Central Unit to ensure timely completion of all day-to-day administrative details, including regulatory
coordination and budgetary matters. The CPIC Administrative Core will utilize an Executive Committee that

1U54AI150225-01,Longitudinal CMV,"This project, A Longitudinal Study of the Durability of Valganciclovir Therapy on Long-Term Hearing and
Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Adolescents Treated During Infancy for Symptomatic Congenital
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Diseases, will be led by David W. Kimberlin, MD. It uses a randomized cohort from an
earlier study of the treatment of infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease to ascertain whether the
treatment benefits on hearing and developmental outcomes seen to 2 years of age persist over the ensuing
decade. That study, known as the CASG 112 trial, was conducted by the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group
and enrolled 109 subjects between 2008 and 2011. It documented that a 6 month duration of treatment of
symptomatic congenital CMV provided superior hearing and developmental outcomes compared with 6 weeks
of antiviral treatment, and that these benefits persisted to 2 years of age. What is not known, though, is
whether these benefits persist longer than this, and whether there are any longer-term toxicities from
valganciclovir therapy provided very early in life.
Subjects previously enrolled in the CASG 112 study are approaching their 12th birthday. We will bring them
back when they are 12 years of age for hearing and developmental assessments. Returning subjects also will
have a pubertal assessment as a marker for potential gonadotoxicity from the earlier valganciclovir therapy,
and for inquiry about development of any cancers.
The results of this study will be important. If these benefits on hearing and development are durable, it
suggests that treatment does not need to be longer than 6 months duration. On the other hand, if the benefits
of 6 months of treatment are not durable (that is, if they wane over time), this is of equal value because it
illumines the next study that needs to be conducted to assesses treatment of perhaps 12 months (or even
longer), with or without the addition of a second antiviral drug such as letermovir. Also, if longer-term toxicities
from the earlier valganciclovir therapy are identified, this will have a direct impact on the clinical treatment of
patients with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. Most importantly, knowledge will be gained from this
longitudinal study of long-term hearing and developmental outcomes following what is now the standard
duration of treatment (6 months) that will benefit children who have received this course of therapy.",,2019,308173,207524,100649,Research Centers,U54,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,"Biodefense; Cancer; Clinical Research; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Hearing Loss; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Pediatric Cancer; Pediatric Research Initiative; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Rare Diseases",DAVID W KIMBERLIN
1U54AI150225-01,EV Sepsis Natural History,"This study, Neonatal Enterovirus and Human Parechovirus Viral Sepsis: Natural History and Predictors of
Morbidity and Mortality, is scientifically led by Mark Abzug, MD. Neonatal viral sepsis is a clinical syndrome
characterized by a constellation of organ involvement that includes hepatitis, coagulopathy (thrombocytopenia
with or without derangement of clotting times), and/or myocarditis, sometimes occurring in concert with
meningoencephalitis or pneumonitis. Although a number of viruses can cause neonatal viral sepsis, including
herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenovirus, two of the most frequent causes are
enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs). Antiviral treatment for neonatal EV or HPeV sepsis
is needed, but not yet commercially available. The design of future antiviral trials for neonatal viral sepsis
would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the natural history of this serious, but rare, condition.
More precise definition of rates of long-term morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal EV and HPeV
sepsis, and better delineation of clinical and laboratory parameters that are predictive of adverse outcomes,
are important to inform the optimal design of therapeutic trials, including issues such as appropriate endpoints,
sample size, and inclusion criteria. The potential utility of quantitative PCR (qPCR) or other laboratory
biomarkers to predict severity of illness, long-term sequelae, or mortality in these illnesses is currently
unknown. If qPCR was shown to be a useful predictor of or surrogate for clinical outcomes, this could greatly
facilitate the performance of therapeutic trials. Finally, studies to date suggest that a portion of children
presenting clinically with neonatal viral sepsis do not have EVs, HPeVs, or other known viruses. It is important
to better understand the full spectrum of etiologic agents using state-of-the-art tools for pathogen discovery.
The proposed study is designed to fill in these gaps in our knowledge about neonatal viral sepsis to advance
trial readiness for the anticipated development of antiviral treatment therapy for this condition. This will be
accomplished by evaluating the following specific aims: 1) to estimate the morbidity and mortality rates of
neonatal EV sepsis and neonatal HPeV sepsis; 2) to identify clinical and laboratory parameters, including
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), predictive of morbidity and mortality from neonatal EV and
neonatal HPeV sepsis; and 3) to determine the etiologies of neonatal viral sepsis not due to EV, HPeV, HSV,
CMV, and adenovirus using next-gen sequencing for pathogen discovery. The systematic prospective
multicenter assessment of neonatal viral sepsis, including EV and HPeV sepsis, will produce data that can be
used in the design of future Phase I, II, and III treatment studies with antiviral drugs currently in development

 The University of North Alabama (UNA) Industrial Hygiene (IH) Program is currently one of four baccalaureate
programs in the US accredited by ASAC of ABET. The UNA IH Program offers a double major in IH and general
chemistry and has earned a reputation for graduating a pool of qualified industrial hygienist who are providing valuable
services to workers and employers in this geographical region and beyond. Enrollment in the program continues to trend
upward with a record number of graduates (15) the previous academic year. The continuation of the NIOSH Training
Project Grant (TPG) is essential to remain effective in recruiting and retaining students with good scholastic merits, to
maintain the current expectations of academic quality, and to expand into new and promising foreseeable opportunities.
Therefore, the objectives of this proposal for the continuation of the NIOSH-TPG are threefold: promote the recruitment
of qualified students in the OH&S field; support the efforts of continuous academic improvement; and expand the
educational opportunities and services of the IH Program.
 Recruitment will be promoted by academic scholarships (NIOSH TPG and departmental) and planned activities to
reach potential candidates including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (mailings; presentations; and participation
in internal and external recruitment events). Continuous improvement will be approached by periodic evaluations of
program objectives, annual evaluations of educational outcomes, and timely correction of shortcomings. Educational
opportunities will be sought after in support of the new, four-year degrees in Engineering Technology (within the
Department of Engineering Technology) and Earth Systems Sustainability (within the Department of Physics and Earth
Science) at UNA.
 The NIOSH TPG has been pivotal in supporting this baccalaureate program in IH housed at a regional university.
From dismal enrollment figures that threatened its viability, the UNA IH program blossomed into a successful academic
program that is often highlighted as exemplary by UNA administrators and noticed by stakeholders as an effective
contributor to the advancement of OH&S. The discontinuation of this grant may certainly halt the continuous path of
success and affect our ability to recruit students, particularly those academically gifted students who we have seen
populating our program over the years.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01NS092651-04,Smad Signaling in Skeletal Muscle as a Biomarker of Disease Progression in ALS,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease of motor neurons that inexorably leads to progressive weakness and death. There is no specific biomarker for this disease, thus often delaying the diagnosis for more than a year. Furthermore, once a diagnosis is established, the current tools to track patients are insensitive for the timely detection of disease improvement or worsening. A biomarker that can facilitate diagnosis, track disease progression, or both, would fill a large clinical gap in ALS management, and expedite clinical trials of novel therapies. A workshop of ALS researchers came to a consensus that biomarkers are critically and urgently needed for this disease, especially those that can track disease progression. In an exploratory R21 grant, using an RNA sequencing approach, we identified members of the Smad family as promising muscle biomarkers of ALS (Si et al., 2014). Smads mediate TGFÎ² and BMP signal transduction by modulating gene transcription and miRNA maturation. We found these markers to be significantly elevated in ALS muscle samples, and they tracked disease progression in the G93A mouse model starting at very early (preclinical) stages. From our preliminary RNA sequencing and validation data, we have found: 1) early upregulation of specific TGF ligands that activate Smads and parallel disease progression, and 2) upregulation of specific miRNAs that are targets of Smad modulation. These novel findings form the basis of our overarching hypothesis in this proposal that the Smad axis of signaling in muscle is a biomarker of ALS. The long term goal is to develop this axis as a biomarker of ALS to track the disease and to provide insight into disease mechanisms at the level of muscle. We propose 3 specific aims to address this hypothesis: 1) Characterize the TGF ligands involved in the Smad axis of signaling in ALS muscle using human and mouse ALS muscle tissues and cultured muscle cells. 2) Correlate miRNA expression patterns in human and mouse ALS muscle samples (as determined by miRNA sequencing) to disease progression. We will assess the impact of Smad induction/activation on these patterns. 3) Characterize the Smad axis of signaling as a biosensor of ALS disease progression. In this aim we will prospectively study the Smad axis of signaling in muscle from a cohort of ALS patients and correlate the molecular patterns of Smad induction/activation and miRNA expression with disease progression. This bench-to-bedside proposal represents an entirely novel direction with compelling translational implications. It vertically integrates basic
and clinical approaches, capitalizing on the collaborative spirit at UAB, to address a major gap in our ability to manage patients with ALS.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disease of motor neurons. There are currently no biomarkers that can facilitate early diagnosis or track progression of the disease. This application will investigate a promising set of biomarkers (Smads) in muscle of ALS patients which may fill this clinical void and improve disease diagnosis and treatment.,2019,321563,218750,102813,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,ALS; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rare Diseases,PETER H KING
1R21NS111275-01,FGF23: a novel biomarker in ALS and more,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disease of motor neurons with no effective
treatment. New treatments are desperately needed, but clinical trials are hampered by the heterogeneous
nature of ALS, such as the variablity and unpredictability of disease progression. There is also a paucity of
sensitive measures to track responses to treatment leading to lengthier and more costly trials and a greater
burdern on the patient. Through an R21-funded RNA sequencing project on human ALS muscle (Si et al.,
2014), we have identified fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) as a promising biomarker in ALS that might help
fill this clinical gap. In our preliminary data, we observe that plasma FGF23 levels increase with disease
progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, and are elevated in a small cohort of ALS patients where
levels appear to correlate positively with rapid decline in functional rating scores. In Specfic Aim 1, we
hypothesize that plasma FGF23 levels will track disease progression and that higher FGF23 levels will
predict a poorer prognosis in ALS patients. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring plasma FGF23 by
ELISA in a large cohort of well characterized and longitudinally followed ALS patients from a national
biorepository. The cohort will represent the diversity of clinical phenotypes inherent in this disease, including
fast- and slow-progressors. In our preliminary studies, we observed also that FGF23 is elevated in muscle,
spinal cord and cortex of the SOD1G93A mouse, suggesting that FGF23 signaling is activated in ALS. FGF23
acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, can be produced by macrophages, and can activate macrophages and
other immune cells to produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². Since neuroinflammation
accelerates disease progression in ALS, elevated FGF23 may represent a disease modifier that contributes to
the clinical heterogeneity of ALS. In Specific Aim 2, we hypothesize that FGF23 is produced in the CNS of
the SOD1G93A mouse by glia or invading immune cells, and that it can activate these cells to produce
inflammatory cytokines. We will perform immunohistochemistry to localize FGF23 in CNS and muscle
tissues of the SOD1G93A mouse and with human ALS tissues from the PI's tissue repository. We will stimulate
microglia and astroglia from wild-type and SOD1G93A mice with FGF23 and assess activation, including the
induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemotaxis. This aim represents an initial investigation into the
potential role of FGF23 in the pathophysiology of ALS and will pave the way for future mechanistic studies.
In summary, this bench-to-bedside proposal represents a novel direction in ALS with compelling translational
implications. It vertically integrates basic and clinical science approaches, capitalizing on the collaborative spirit
at UAB and the U. of Miami, to address a major gap in testing new treatments in ALS. At the same time, it will
begin to investigate a new signaling pathway that might provide insight into molecular mechanisms that drive
clinical progression in ALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal degenerative disease of motor neurons. There are currently no
biomarkers that can predict prognosis or track progression of the disease. This proposal will investigate
FGF23, a novel biomarker which may fill this clinical void and also provide insight into the pathophysiology of
the disease.",2019,421545,286169,135376,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,ALS; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,PETER H KING
1I01BX004419-01,Role of Microglial Hur in promoting neuroinflammation and ALS disease progression,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease of motor neurons that leads to progressive
weakness and death. There is no effective treatment, leaving the patient (and family) burdened with an
overwhelming emotional, physical and monetary fallout as the disease progresses. The physician can provide
some symptomatic relief, but there is a deep sense of frustration in not being able to treat the disease,
underscoring a strong need to identify new treatments. Veterans of foreign wars have a significantly higher
incidence of ALS than the civilian population, and thus investigations into disease mechanisms and novel
therapeutic pathways, such as the one proposed here, are of direct relevance to the VA mission.The ever
growing list of genes linked to ALS implicates a wide range of molecular pathways in disease initiation.
Neuroinflammation, however, is a common downstream element in ALS that, independent of the disease
initiating factor, can modulate disease progression. Microglia are a major component of neuroinflammation and
play dual roles in ALS: on the one hand delaying clinical onset and progression early in the disease and on the
other hand accelerating disease progression in later stages. The diversity of these roles reflects the broad and
dynamic molecular repertoire of the microglial cell. Understanding the determinants of this repertoire is critical
for opening up new therapeutic approaches. In our preliminary data and recent publication, we have identified
the RNA binding protein HuR as a major promoter of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in
microglia and a suppressor of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Through the regulation of downstream targets, we
found that HuR drives many cellular properties of microglial activation including migration, invasion and the
chemoattraction of other immune cells. This background forms the basis of our hypothesis that HuR plays a
pivotal role in ALS by promoting the molecular underpinnings of pro-inflammatory activation in microglia and
suppressing the molecular program that promotes an anti-inflammatory, disease delaying phenotype. We
propose three specific aims to address this hypothesis: 1) determine the molecular mechanism of pro-
inflammatory cytokine attenuation and anti-inflammatory cytokine augmentation in wild-type and ALS-
associated microglia after HuR knockout, 2) characterize the impact of HuR knockout on wild-type and ALS-
associated microglial activation, migration/invasion in response to inflammatory signals and on chemoattraction
of other immune cells, and 3) characterize the impact of HuR knockout in microglia on ALS onset and
progression in the mutant SOD1 mouse. We recently developed a mouse model in which HuR is genetically
deleted from microglia and this will greatly facilitate the completion of these aims. The long term objective of
this proposal is to characterize the role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in governing the molecular and
cellular phenotype of glia and the impact on ALS. The innovation of this proposal is its investigation of post-
transcriptional regulation as a novel pathway in neuroinflammation and a proof-of-principle investigation of HuR
as a therapeutic target in ALS. The significance of this application extends beyond ALS as microglia and
neuroinflammation play critical roles in modulating other CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
multiple sclerosis ,spinal cord injury and stroke.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a relentless disease of motor neurons that leads to progressive paralysis of the
muscles and ultimately death. There is a significantly increased incidence of this disease in our veterans of
foreign wars, and treatment options are limited and with only modest effect. Initiation of ALS and its
progression is markedly influenced by neuroinflammation that is triggered by immune cells in the central
nervous system. This proposal will address the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation in ALS by
focusing on microglia which are key contributors to the immune response in ALS. This work will identify novel
pathways that can be targeted for new therapies in this devastating disease.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,PETER H KING
5R01CA213223-03,Proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors,"The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Btz), carfilzomib (Cfz) and ixazomib (Ixz) are successfully used for the
treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), but lack clinical efficacy against solid tumors despite demonstrating
significant activity in tissue culture and animal models. In an effort to understand this discrepancy, we decided
to focus on triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), a genetically diverse group that lacks targeted treatments.
TNBCs overexpress pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, which plays a key role in proteasome inhibitor-induced
apoptosis, and are proteasome-addicted. The proteasome has three pairs of active sites: ÃŸ5, ÃŸ1, and ÃŸ2. The
primary target of Btz and Cfz are the ÃŸ5 sites. At concentrations of Btz and Cfz that induce apoptosis in TNBC
in culture, co-inhibition of either ÃŸ1 or ÃŸ2 is also observed. These concentrations exceed clinically relevant
concentrations, potentially explaining why proteasome inhibitors have no in vivo activity in solid tumors, and
suggesting that stronger co-inhibition of either ÃŸ1 or ÃŸ2 would improve in vivo activity. It is not known whether
the ÃŸ2 or the ÃŸ1 site is a better target. We developed specific inhibitors of the ÃŸ1 and ÃŸ2 sites and CRISPR-
generated mutations of these sites. We found that LU-102 and mutations in the ÃŸ2 sites are much stronger
sensitizers of TNBC cells to Cfz and Btz than the ÃŸ1 inhibitor NC-021 or ÃŸ1 mutations; ÃŸ2 mutations sensitize
orthotopic xenografts of TNBC cells to sub-toxic doses of Cfz. LU-102 and ÃŸ2 mutations block recovery of
proteasome activity in Cfz-treated cells. In contrast to myeloma cells, proteasome activity recovers in TNBC
cells treated with clinically relevant concentrations of Cfz. We found that LU-102 and ÃŸ2 mutations inhibit
recovery of proteasome activity by causing aggregation of Nrf1 (NFE2L1/TCF11), a transcription factor that up-
regulates proteasome genes expression in cells treated with ÃŸ5 inhibitors. NC-021 and ÃŸ1 mutations do not
block recovery of proteasome activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that ÃŸ2 inhibitors will sensitize TNBCs to
FDA-approved ÃŸ5 inhibitors, by the mechanism which involves tumor-specific inhibition of Nrf1-mediated
recovery of proteasome activity. We further hypothesize that targeting enzymes involved in Nrf1 activation will
also sensitize TNBC to proteasome inhibitors. The specific aims of this proposal are: (i) to determine whether
ÃŸ2 inhibitors sensitize TNBC to Cfz, Btz, and Ixz in vivo; (ii) to determine whether ÃŸ2 inhibitors block recovery
of proteasome activity in a tumor-specific fashion in vivo and determine whether alternative approaches to
target this recovery sensitize tumors to FDA-approved inhibitors. Accomplishing these aims will demonstrate
that the ÃŸ2 sites and Nrf1 are effective drug targets in TNBC, establish the mechanism of action of ÃŸ2
inhibitors, pave the road to clinical trials of ÃŸ2 inhibitors in TNBC, and launch future work in solid tumors of
different organs.","According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 250,000 American women were diagnosed with
breast cancer in 2016, and ~40,000 died from the disease. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), i.e.
cancers that do not express estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors, account for ~18% of all breast
cancers but cause 25% of all breast cancer deaths. TNBCs are characterized by an early age of onset and
high aggressiveness. Although TNBCs respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy they are prone to recur,
metastasize and acquire resistance. These cancers are genetically heterogeneous, and molecularly-targeted
treatments are not available to them. Novel treatments for TNBCs are urgently needed.",2019,345478,274497,70981,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,UNIVERSITY-WIDE,368325888,Breast Cancer; Cancer,Alexei  Kisselev
1R43AI140807-01A1,Novel oral delivery system for subunit vaccine against ETEC,"Project Summary/Abstract
Oral vaccines have the potential to make a revolutionary improvement in the quality of life in
developing countries. Since these vaccines can be administered by community health workers
who are not trained medical personnel, the number of people who can be immunized in a short
period of time is drastically increased while the cost per patient is significantly lowered. Oral
vaccines also avoid the danger of contaminated syringes and needles which is a serious threat in
areas with high rates of HIV and hepatitis. One obstacle to the wider use of oral vaccines against
infectious diseases is that most vaccines are destroyed as they pass through the harsh acidic
environment of the stomach where they are degraded by proteolytic enzymes. The goal of this
research project is to develop a new delivery system for oral vaccines that protects the vaccine
proteins as they pass through the stomach and the lumen of the intestine. This vaccine targets
enterotoxogenic E. coli (ETEC), a major cause of death in young children living in South Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa. ETEC infections are also the major cause of diarrhea in tourists and
military personnel travelling to the developing world. No vaccine has been licensed for the
prevention of ETEC. This Phase I SBIR research project is designed to shield the ETEC vaccine
proteins within microbeads that remain sealed until they come into direct contact with the wall
of the small intestine. Only then are the encapsulated proteins released from the carriers. As a
result, the vaccine proteins are shielded from destruction by proteases until they are in close
proximity to the M cells of the Peyerâ€™s patches. This should greatly improve the odds that a
vaccine will be taken up by the M cells and be passed on to mucosal immune cells. To establish
proof of concept of this system, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) Optimize the performance
of the microbeads in terms of a) their protection of encapsulated protein antigens from
proteases and b) the release of the antigens upon contact with brush border enzymes; 2) Load
the microbeads with defined amounts of selected ETEC antigens and an established adjuvant;
and 3) Test the ability of the loaded microbeads to induce immune responses in mice when
administered by gavage. An important feature of the delivery system is that it is based on a
natural breakdown product of potato starch. This raises the possibility that the system can be
scaled up at modest cost and that it can provide a feasible option for widespread immunization
in resource-poor communities.","Project Narrative
Infectious diseases take nearly 15 million human lives each year, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South
America. Oral vaccines offer the single greatest hope to improve this situation but in most cases these
vaccines have not been as effective as injected vaccines. This research project is designed to test a new
strategy that could greatly improve the success of oral vaccines and could be of major benefit to millions
of people in underdeveloped areas of the world. Specifically, this project seeks to develop a relatively
inexpensive oral vaccine against ETEC, a bacterial infection that each year kills thousands of children
under the age of 5 in low income countries.",2019,224135,151034,60414,SBIR/STTR,R43,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,FOODSOURCE LURE CORPORATION,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic For-Profits,352221358,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Vaccine Related,Martin  Klinger
5R01DK087967-08,Oxalobacter formigenes colonization and oxalate excretion in calcium oxalate kidney stone disease,"Project Summary
Calcium oxalate kidney stone disease occurs in approximately 9 % of the U.S. population and contributes
significantly to health care costs. Small reductions in urinary oxalate excretion are thought to limit stone risk.
Recent studies have indicated that a lack of Oxalobacter formigenes colonization is a significant risk factor
for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation. Our Preliminary data shows that healthy human subjects lacking
O.formigenes can be readily colonized with live preparations of O.formigenes. This ability to colonize
individuals offers a powerful means of assessing responses to varying diets before and after colonization. It
is still not clear under what conditions O.formigenes modifies stone risk, and much still needs to be learned
about how this organism establishes and maintains gut colonization. In the previous funding cycle
we identified in a mouse model conditions that influence the growth of O.formigenes in the gut, its
degradation of oxalate in the gut, its effects on the amount of oxalate excreted in urine and into the intestine,
and its sustainability in the absence of dietary oxalate. In this application we will extend these findings to
humans by examining individuals before and after colonization with O.formigenes. Diets controlled in their
contents of oxalate, calcium and other nutrients, including a diet ultra-low in oxalate, will be used to examine
the interaction between diet, O.formigenes colonization and urinary oxalate excretion. This proposal will use
spinach that contains carbon 13-oxalate to accurately determine whether colonization modifies the response
to an oxalate-rich meal. Continuous intravenous infusions of the stable, non-radioactive oxalate isotope, 13C2-
oxalate, before and after colonization will directly determine if gastrointestinal oxalate secretion occurs and
whether colonization influences such secretion. Recent evidence suggests individuals are colonized with
different strains and in some cases more than one strain. However, it is not known whether the biological
differences between strains influence colonization persistence and urinary oxalate excretion and this will be
examined in this application. If the specific aims are successfully completed they will provide valuable
information about the importance of O.formigenes colonization in influencing oxalate levels, will create insight
into the factors that impact O.formigenes colonization, and will help identify new strategies for modifying the
gut milieu and calcium oxalate kidney stone risk.","Project Narrative
Despite evidence suggesting a lack of O.formigenes colonization is a risk factor for calcium oxalate stone
formation, very little is known about the factors that affect its survival, and its impact on oxalate handling. The
purpose of this proposal is to use diets of known nutrient composition to facilitate our understanding of these
poorly understood areas in both healthy human subjects and calcium oxalate kidney stone formers.",2019,442131,297731,144400,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Kidney Disease; Nutrition; Urologic Diseases,John  Knight
1I01HX002315-01,Aligning policy and healthcare services with Veterans' values and preferences for results from Whole Genome Sequencing,"Over the past decade, genomic medicine has rapidly expanded from single gene testing to include next-
generation sequencing (NGS) tests, such as Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), that reveal extensive
genomic information. During this same time period, the technical cost of sequencing a genome has fallen from
over $30 million in 2003 to approximately $1,000 in 2016. VA and the nation are making significant
investments in the research infrastructure needed to accelerate the translation of new genomic technologies to
support personalized healthcare where risk assessment, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment are informed by
a person's genomics. The VA Genomic Medicine Program's Million Veterans Program (MVP) initiated in 2009
and the national $215 million Precision Medicine Initiative launched in 2015 are expected to further speed
genomic discoveries and translation in personalized healthcare. In step with the national Precision Medicine
Initiative, the VA is developing strategies to release the results of genomic analyses to the next 500,000
Veterans who will be enrolled in the MVP cohort and WGS and other genome-based testing is beginning to be
used beyond research, to inform disease risk, diagnosis, and treatment, in VA clinical settings.
Juxtaposed with government and public enthusiasm for the potential of NGS enabled applications, a
substantial gap exists between what WGS can deliver in terms of the quantity of genomic information, and
what results can be interpreted that patients would find meaningful. One of the challenges is the complexity of
WGS information that will include findings unrelated to the original purpose of testing and results that have
uncertain significance in preventing, diagnosing, and treating disease. With emerging use of WGS and other
genome-based testing in VA, there is an urgent need to understand what information Veterans think would be
important in their healthcare. However, little systematic quantitative information is available for VA leadership
decision making on how Veterans would assess the value of WGS information, or their preferences for the
healthcare services needed to interpret the findings and their implications for health and healthcare.
The proposed project is timely, addressing a significant gap in knowledge of Veterans' preferences and taking
advantage of an opportunity to engage key VA stakeholders--Veterans and VA executives--at a critical moment
when the introduction of new technologies will require the adaptation of clinical practices. In this project, our
goal is to establish a foundation for understanding 1) how Veterans value the findings from WGS and other
NGS enabled tests; 2) what healthcare services Veterans prefer to help them comprehend the information from
these tests and to use the findings in their healthcare; and 3) how VA clinical leaders and policy makers use
knowledge of Veterans' values and preferences for WGS in their development of clinical services that
incorporate information from WGS and other genome-based tests.
To accomplish the aims of the project, we used sequential mixed methods (qualitative-quantitative-qualitative).
We will identify Veterans' values and preferences for WGS using focus groups and structured cognitive
interviews and then conduct a national population-based survey of Veterans' preferences using choice-based
conjoint analysis. To translate findings on Veterans' preferences, we will conduct facilitated deliberative
process groups to engage VA leaders in discussion about how Veterans' perspectives can inform VA policy in
clinical genomics.
This project is innovative. Its rigorous design and strong stakeholder engagement methods are expected to
contribute to Veteran-centered care in clinical genomic medicine. Further, the findings will be highly relevant to
VA executive decision-making about how to disclose the results of WGS and other genome-based tests to
Veterans.","Over the past decade, genomic medicine has rapidly expanded from single gene testing to include next-

1K01HL145128-01A1,Adiposity and Sleep-Associated Cardiometabolic Disease Risk Factors,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background. Obesity and short sleep duration are significant public health issues with evidence suggesting
these conditions are associated with premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and
inflammation. In the United States, 37.9% of adults are classified as obese, having a body mass index (BMI)
of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Stratified by sex, 35.2% of men and 40.5% of women meet the BMI cut-point for
obesity. Similarly, curtailed sleep duration is commonplace, with an estimated 35.3% of adults in the United
States receiving less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep during a 24-hour period. In recent years, there
has been an increased interest in the potential link between obesity and short sleep duration due to: (1) the
apparent parallel increase in prevalence of both conditions over the past few decades; (2) their overlapping
association with cardiometabolic outcomes; and (3) the potential causal connection between the two health
issues. Research. The proposed investigation will seek to contribute to the development of a comprehensive
adiposity-sleep model, while laying the groundwork for a future program of research seeking to prevent and
treat adiposity and sleep-related cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The study proposed within this K-award
is intended to investigate four topics pertinent to the adiposity-sleep hypothesis: (1) the relationship between
adiposity and sleep duration; (2) sex-based differences in the relationship between adiposity and sleep
duration; (3) influence of adiposity indices and sleep duration on cardiometabolic outcomes; and (4) the role
of socioecological factors as effect modifiers in the relationship between adiposity indices, sleep, and
cardiometabolic outcomes. To address these aims, the proposed study will employ a large-scale survey
(n=1,000) to recruit 159 subjects (53 normal weight, 53 overweight, and 53 obese) to be assessed in two
phases. Phase 1, an in-lab study, will be used to gather objective adiposity indices (air displacement
plethysmography and anthropometrics) and cardiometabolic data (blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and
pulse wave analysis, and blood-based biomarker). Phase 2, a one-week, home-based study, will be used to
gather sleep-related data (home sleep testing/sleep apnea, actigraphy, sleep diaries). During Phase 2,
detailed demographic and socioecological data will be collected to contextualize hypothesized adiposity and
sleep-associated cardiometabolic disease risk factors. Collection and analyses of these data will provide
necessary information to customize future observational and intervention research. Training. Pedagogically,
the training plan for the K01 is comprised of the didactic training (coursework, seminars, symposia), mentoring
(directed research, readings, tutorials), and dissemination deliverables (publications, presentations, and
proposals) required to complete the proposed project and to initiate a pathway towards research
independence. This career development plan builds upon the applicantâ€™s previous obesity and sleep health
research and couples these two independent health issues into an interconnected line of inquiry.","8. PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01AI145332-01,Dynamics of the protective vaccine-induced human influenza neuraminidase B cell response,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human immune response against influenza is dominated by the production of hemagglutinin (HA)-specific
antibodies (Abs). The yearly mutation rate in influenza HA proteins is 1-2% leading to development of new viral
strains that are resistant to previous immunity. The other most predominant glycoprotein on the virion surface is
neuraminidase (NA). Although immunogenic, predominance of human NA-specific Abs is much lower than HA,
probably because NA expression is only one fourth the amount of HA on the virion surface. The yearly rate of
mutation of NA is about half that of HA while part of the enzymatic site remains conserved across type A (IAV)
and B (IBV) influenza viruses, making NA a potentially effective target for universal vaccine and therapeutic
human monoclonal Ab (hmAb) development. Antibody responses targeting NA have demonstrated protective
and therapeutic activity against influenza infection in animals, and in humans NA-inhibiting serum Abs have been
correlated with effective protection, reduced disease severity, and duration of viral shedding, independent of or
more strongly than HA-specific Ab responses, substantiating NA as a valuable target for the prevention and
treatment of influenza in humans. Although seasonal human inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) contain NA, the
extent and mechanisms of action of protective human NA-specific humoral responses induced by vaccination
are poorly resolved. Our research has demonstrated that IIV in humans does induce both IAV and IBV NA-
specific B cells, and that the Ab clonal lineages they encode for include those that have broad and potent ability
to protect and treat influenza infection. Further, we have demonstrated that these protective NA-specific B cell
clonal lineages are present in long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans following IIV and are the likely
source for their sustained presence in circulation. We posit that NA-mediated universal humoral protection, like
HA, is dependent on B cell receptor/Ab specificity, however, to a greater extent than HA is also highly dependent
on the precise Fc/IgG subclass composition of the NA-specific Ab repertoire. Our central hypothesis is that
human IIV induces NA-specific B cell responses with broad protective potential, however, those with both the
proper specificity and anti-viral activity to confer universal protection are subdominant and sporadically induced,
hence at insufficient abundance to confer optimal protection. Through precisely defining the dynamics of those
protective human NA-specific B cell clonal lineages, including their induction, frequency, persistence, precise
specificity, and mechanisms of action, we expect to obtain insight on how to optimally stimulate them for future
human universal vaccine strategies. To that end, we propose 1) define the evolution of human NA-specific B cell
clonal lineages in response to seasonal IIV 2) assess the ability of IIV-induced human NA B cell lineages to
inhibit infection and transmission and 3) evaluate the Fc-dependence of NA-specific hmAb protection. The
process for the development of protective human NA-specific B cell clonal lineages will be defined and strategies
to translate this to universal human vaccine-mediated protection from influenza infection identified.","RELEVANCE
The extensive genetic variability in seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza strains necessitates new vaccine
strategies that can focus the immune response on generating protective antibodies against conserved targets
such as regions within the influenza neuraminidase protein. We have demonstrated that seasonal immunization
stimulates neuraminidase specific antibodies in humans that are broad and potent in their protection from
influenza when tested in animals. This project will define how various influenza vaccine types impact the
characteristics of neuraminidase specific antibodies in humans and what properties of neuraminidase specific
antibodies are most effective at preventing influenza infection against diverse strains.",2019,750079,595817,154262,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related,James J Kobie; Luis  Martinez-Sobrido
7R01DE027245-03,Targeting tonsillar B cells for the induction of effective mucosal immunity to HIV,"Project Summary/Abstract
An effective HIV vaccine is likely to be dependent on sufficient quantity and quality of HIV Envelope (Env)-specific
antibody at the rectal and vaginal mucosa. Priming of the oral mucosa is viewed as a promising approach to generate
mucosal antibody at HIV entry sites, however the understanding of the mechanisms that mediate this process are
poorly understood. Our project seeks to precisely define the dynamics of inducing intestinal-mucosal plasma cells
through direct intra-tonsillar (i.t.) immunization, and empirically test strategies to tune this process for obtaining an
optimal mucosal antibody profile (localization, breadth, function, and durability) to achieve a protective HIV vaccine
strategy. A main emphasis for inducing HIV-specific B cell responses has been to evaluate adjuvants/stimuli that
target conventional B cell responses; leaving induction of non-conventional B cell responses, including those with
direct relevance to mucosal antibody production largely under-explored. IgM memory, one such unconventional B cell
population, is IgM memory, a major first line of defense against mucosal pathogens, and includes heterologous
subsets such as marginal zone and B-1 B cells, which are major precursors of mucosal IgA plasma cells. Our
research has demonstrated that IgM memory B cells are highly responsive to acute HIV infection and their
maintenance is highly correlated with Env-specific antibody development. Mechanisms to induce robust IgM
memory vaccine responses remain poorly defined, although our recent work has demonstrated the ability of IL-
9 and IL-33, known regulators of mucosal immunity, to promote the robust development of HIV Env-specific
IgM, in addition to increasing the breadth, magnitude, and durability of the Env-specific IgG and IgA response
when combined with the promising DNA/protein HIV Env immunogen platform VC10014 which elicits Tier 2
neutralizing antibody in rhesus macaques. Our central hypothesis is that conditioning the tonsil
microenvironment with IL-9 or IL-33 will enable the rapid induction of durable and effective mucosal humoral
immunity by the VC10014 HIV vaccine platform. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: 1)
Define the effect of the tonsil microenvironment on the induction of mucosal humoral immunity, 2) Evaluate the
protective ability of IL-9 or IL-33 adjuvanted VC10014 HIV vaccine platform, and 3) Identify strategies for
enhancing human tonsil primary B cell responses to immunization. This project will significantly advance our
insight into preventing HIV transmission and the mechanisms that control the development of protective
humoral mucosal responses to HIV.","Project Narrative
The development of an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection will require the induction and persistence of
broadly neutralizing antibody at mucosal sites of virus entry. We propose to evaluate a novel strategy that
includes vaccinating directly into the tonsils to generate such antibodies and protect from infection. This project
will provide critical dissection of the mucosal HIV-specific B cell response necessary to advance HIV vaccine

5P01HL136267-03,Integrated control of endothelin production in the collecting duct,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
 The collecting duct (CD) endothelin-1 (ET-1) system plays a key role in regulating blood pressure (BP) and
urinary Na+ excretion. ET-1 directly inhibits CD Na+ and water reabsorption; CD-specific knockout of ET-1
causes salt-sensitive hypertension. ET receptor antagonist-induced fluid retention, a major factor limiting the
success of these agents in clinical trials, is largely due to blockade of CD ET-1 actions. Given that CD ET-1
modulates body fluid volume (BFV) homeostasis, it is important to define how this system is regulated by
changes in BFV status. Urinary ET-1 excretion is increased in response to salt or water loading; since urinary
ET-1 largely derives from the CD, these findings suggest that BFV regulates CD ET-1 production. The
mechanism(s) by which BFV expansion enhances CD ET-1 synthesis are incompletely understood. We have
found that flow enhances ET-1 production by the inner medullary CD (IMCD) through activation of Ca2+-
depending signaling and may require primary cilia and polycystins-1 and -2; these findings raise exciting
possibilities about the role of primary cilia and polycystins in the regulation of CD ET-1 and CD salt and water
reabsorption. In addition, we found that the purinergic receptors P2Y2 and P2X7 may be important in the IMCD
ET-1 flow response, suggesting a link between acutely (ATP) and chronically (ET-1) acting natriuretic and
diuretic factors in the CD. We have also found that nitric oxide (NO), likely via NO synthase 3, is necessary for
flow stimulation of IMCD ET-1; since NO has never been shown to increase ET-1, this represents a novel and
important area of investigation. Taken together, these new findings form the basis for our key hypotheses: 1)
Flow increases IMCD ET-1 production through an interplay between cilia, polycystins-1 and -2, P2Y2 and
P2X7 receptors, NO and Ca2+-depending signaling; and 2) Cilia, polycystins-1 and -2, P2Y2 and P2X7
receptors, and NO modulation of CD ET-1 affects CD salt and water handling and BP. The following specific
aims will be addressed: 1) Evaluate cilia and polycystin regulation of CD ET-1 synthesis and renal
function. This involves determining if cilia and polycystins-1 and -2 in the CD regulate BP and salt and water
excretion under physiological conditions, if ET-1 plays a role in such regulation, and how cilia and polycystins-1
and -2 in the CD modulate ET-1 production. 2) Evaluate purinergic regulation of CD ET-1 synthesis and
renal function. This involves determining if P2Y2 and P2X7 modulate BP and urinary salt and water excretion
under physiological conditions, if CD ET-1 plays a role in such regulation, and how P2Y2 and P2X7 in the CD
modulate ET-1 production. 3) Evaluate NO regulation CD ET-1 synthesis and renal function. This involves
identification of the role of specific NOS isoforms in the CD in modulating BP and urinary salt and water
excretion under physiological conditions, if CD ET-1 plays a role in such regulation, and how NOS isoforms in
the CD modulate ET-1 production. Taken together, this studies will greatly enhance understanding of how
tubule fluid flow regulates CD salt and water reabsorption and the role of ET-1 in this process.","PROJECT 2 NARRATIVE

5P01HL136267-03,Animal and Analytical Core,"ANIMAL AND ANALYTICAL CORE (B) PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary goal and function of Core B is to provide the appropriate animals and analytical assays required
by projects in the Program Project. The objectives of Core B are to serve three basic support functions. First,
Core B is responsible for maintaining the rodent colonies used in each Project. Second, Core B is responsible
for generating the new collecting duct and vascular endothelial-specific knockout (KO) mice used in each
Project. Third, Core B will provide analytical expertise and genotyping services. Core B will be a joint effort
between the University of Utah (Dr. Donald Kohan) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) (Dr.
Jennifer Pollock). This arrangement will allow sharing of expertise in developing and breeding novel rodent
models to provide the highest degree of quality control and allow consistency in animal models and analytical
services across all of the individual projects of the Program Project. Aim 1 is to provide ETB-receptor deficient
rats, Bmal1 KO rats, global P2X7 KO mice, global P2Y2 KO mice, LC-1 mice, and mice with collecting duct-
specific KO of Bmal1, NOS1, ET-1 or ETB. This includes setting up the appropriate breeding pairs, assigning
unique identifiers to each animal, tail clipping, genotyping, maintaining husbandry and genotyping records, and
ensuring that a sufficient number of animals continue to be available for Projects 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, it
will include coordinating shipping of animals from Utah to UAB (Projects 1 and 3), and UAB to University of
Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) (Project 3). Aim 2 is to generate and provide the
mice with inducible collecting duct-specific KO (polaris, polycystin-1, polycystin-2, or HDAC1), collecting duct-
specific KO (NOS3, NOS1/NOS3), and vascular endothelial cell-specific KO (ET-1, ETB Bmal1). This activity
includes breeding floxed polaris, floxed PC1, floxed PC-2 or floxed HDAC1 mice with HoxB7-rtTA and LC-1
mice to create inducible, collecting duct specific KO mice. Floxed (loxP-flanked) NOS3 or Bmal1 mice will be
bred with AQP2-Cre mice to generate collecting duct specific KO of NOS3 or Bmal1, respectively. Tie2-Cre
mice will be bred with floxed ET-1, ETB or floxed Bmal1 mice to generate vascular endothelial cell-specific KO
of ET-1, ETB or Bmal1, respectively. These activities will occur at the University of Utah and UAB and will
provide sufficient animals for all Projects. This includes setting up breeding pairs, assigning unique identifiers
to each animal, tail clipping, genotyping, and maintaining husbandry and genotyping records. Aim 3 is to
provide analytical expertise and genotyping services for of the gene-targeted animal models outlined in this
PPG require genotyping. Core B will assist all Projects with analysis of genotyping results; in addition, given
Dr. Kohan's expertise with confirming the degree and site(s) of gene targeting, Core B will assist all Projects
with analysis of experiments characterizing the degree and sites of KO of the targeted allele(s). Aim 4 is to
provide quality control and quantity purchasing for all mouse and rat studies for consistent and accurate results
by monitoring and integrating procedures performed at the University of Utah, UAB, and the UTHSCSA.","ANIMAL AND ANALYTICAL CORE (B) NARRATIVE

5R25HG010028-02,Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences in Genomic Medicine (SURE-GM),"Summary
New strategies to increase the diversity of biomedical scientists engaged in genetic and
genomic research is a critical goal for continued improvements in human health and genomic
medicine. This goal is especially important in the Deep South, a region in which a large
proportion of the population experiences health care disparities, where there is a large African-
American population, and where many studentsâ€”from both advantaged and disadvantaged
backgroundsâ€”pursue undergraduate education in the Alabama state university system, or in
historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs) within Alabama.
This R25 application proposes to leverage and build on the collaborative environment at the
University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB) and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology to
develop SURE-GM, a two consecutive summer program tailored for HBCU undergraduate
students that will equip and provide them with the necessary skills, exposures, and experiences
to participate and contribute meaningfully to graduate and/or professional training in genomic
sciences. Twelve scholars per year will be identified and recruited from Alabama HBCUs as
rising juniors. The scholars will spend their first summer at HudsonAlpha engaged in training for
foundational research skills, their second summer at UAB engaged in mentored research, and
will participate in a ""One to Two"" continuity program during the intervening academic year. A
robust assessment and review process will be developed that allows for real-time feedback and
evaluation. These efforts will lead to greater participation of underrepresented students in the
biomedical workforce, greater diversity of scientists and physician scientists engaged in
biomedical research, and greater appreciation of the roles and potential of genomic medicine in
science and society.","Narrative

2R01EY023603-05,Comprehensive quantification of cone dynamics,"Project Summary
 Vision forms a prominent part of our daily lives, and this sensory process begins with the
capture of light by a particular class of photoreceptor called cones, a class well adapted to daylight
conditions, to high acuity vision, and to color perception. The basic response properties of cone
photoreceptors have been largely described in studies conducted in isolated cells or retinal tissue.
Surprisingly, many of these response properties, such as temporal dynamics and intensity
sensitivity range, remain controversial in the literature. Moreover, some of them conflict with
data acquired in vivo and with human visual performance when measured psychophysically. The
primary aims of this grant are to generate a more comprehensive characterization of cone
photoreceptors in cone-dominated animals, including primates. This will be achieved by conjoint
experiments conducted in intact retinal explants in parallel with in vivo recordings where it is
now possible to target single cones with adaptive optics microstimulation. Similar stimulation
paradigms will be employed in each experimental approach to the measure intensity response
functions, the rapidity of time-to-peak, the decay kinetics following saturating stimuli, and the
adaptation rate in response to changing background light levels. These data will be used to
develop a complete theoretical model of response properties based on cone phototransduction
which will be of great use to vision scientists and may delineate the limits and boundaries of in
vivo vs. in vitro experiments on the retina. An additional aim will be to detail how a novel form
of cone activationâ€”via pulsed infrared 2-photon excitationâ€”may be used for improved spatial
stimulation of cones. The 2-photon experiments are best done interleaved with traditional 1-
photon stimulation in order to examine how the 2-photon excitation mechanism differs from 1-
photon absorption, and also to determine how much endogenous fluorescence may be generated
by such stimuli. As 2-photon absorption may be used to measure the health of the cone visual
cycle, understanding the basic response properties of infrared stimulation will be foundational for
future studies of cone function and disease.","Project Narrative
 The fundamental physiological responses of primate cone photoreceptors will be
quantified along two independent but parallel lines of experiments: one will be drawn from
explant tissue where cone responses can be measured directly, and the second will be made in situ
where the cones will be stimulated one-by-one in the intact eye and downstream neural responses
will be recorded indirectly. The experiments will also compare photoresponses produced from 2-
photon absorption in cone photopigments, as this may become a useful tool for assessing
photoreceptor health in the future. We will be developing a theoretical model of cone
phototransduction based on molecular underpinnings that will take into account the dynamic
response properties of cones as revealed by the physiological experiments.",2019,483860,349230,134630,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences,Timothy W Kraft; LAWRENCE C SINCICH

7. Project/Summary Abstract
Non-invasive assessment of eye structure and function is essential to both basic and translational research in
vision science. Widely used technologies include slit lamp for biomicroscopy of anterior and posterior segment,
electroretinography (ERG, for massed retinal signal separable into components), optical coherence tomography
(OCT) for display of layered tissues in posterior and anterior segments, imaging of the fundus via multiple modes
of visualization (color, autofluorescence, dye-based angiography, infrared reflectance), and optokinetic
nystagmus (to assess visuomotor control, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity). In response to growing UAB
vision researcher needs, a new â€œOcular Phenotyping Coreâ€ was established to encompass a comprehensive
suite of instrumentation and to provide the necessary support for a qualified PhD staff member to assist in
accurate ocular phenotyping. Specific instruments include Bioptigen 840 nm SD-OCT and Micron IV digital
fundus camera for small animals, Spectralis SDOCT for large animals and human donor eyes, and Optomotry
optokinetic nystagmus in small animals including mice and zebrafish. This core will support 15 UAB Vision
Scientists, including 13 with planned moderate to extensive use and 9 who are currently NEI R01-funded. Review
of publications during the two years prior to this application reveals excellent productivity using these
collaboratively purchased instruments, justifying the formalizing of these activities as a core. The Director and
Associate Director of this proposed core have extensive publication experience in electroretinography and OCT
validation/ interpretation, respectively. New directions for the core include the establishment of MRI imaging for
calcium flux in rodent eyes. Additionally an â€œOcular Phenotyping Fairâ€ will be implemented to identify new ocular
mouse models through full ocular phenotyping screens of mouse models generated by non-ocular scientists that
were originally generated to answer questions pertinent to thier organ systems of interest.",,2019,72891,49382,23509,Research Centers,P30,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences,Timothy W Kraft
5K23MH106683-05,Structural and Neurometabolic White Matter Integrity in the Deficit Syndrome,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current system of psychiatric diagnosis does not include characteristics that delineate patterns of symptoms, severity of illness or prognostic features. This greatly hinders progress in our understanding of mental illness and development of more specific treatments. The deficit syndrome is thought to be a more homogeneous subgroup of schizophrenia that is characterized by primary and enduring negative symptoms. It is associated with greater global impairment, lower quality of life, and poorer long-term outcome. We propose to use multimodal neuroimaging to study 20 schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome, 20 schizophrenia patients without the deficit syndrome, and 20 matched healthy controls. We will use (1) Diffusion Tensor Imaging to measure structural white matter integrity, (2) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure neurometabolic white matter integrity, and (3) resting state functional MRI to measure functional connectivity to test the hypotheses that white matter integrity and related functional connectivity patterns differ between deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. Using complementary neuroimaging techniques will allow generating a broad characterization of structural and neurometabolic white matter abnormalities and their functional consequences in the deficit syndrome. The results of proposed study might not only lead to identification of biomarkers that can assist in identification of patients at risk for developing the deficit syndrome before the clinical picture manifests, it will also provide the training necessary to prepare the candidate for an independent research career with focus on translational research in psychotic disorders.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The deficit syndrome is a subtype of schizophrenia that is associated with greater global impairment, lower quality of life, and poorer long-term prognosis.

60 unmedicated chronic psychosis patients, and 120 matched healthy controls. We will use (1) advanced
diffusion weighted imaging to measure white matter structural integrity, (2) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

peripheral inflammatory and glutamatergic markers to test the hypothesis that white matter integrity deficits
increase as a function of illness stage and that glutamate excess and inflammation contribute to white matter

5R03AG059994-02,Fibroblast Growth Factor 23/Klotho Crosstalk and Airway Epithelial Senescence in COPD,"ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to identify Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 23 and klotho as potential aging
markers in COPD subgroups and develop future therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) currently represents the third leading cause of mortality in
North America and the majority of cases are caused by cigarette smoke. Both clinical and cellular evidence
support the concept that accelerated lung aging serves as an underlying mechanism for its pathogenesis.
We have good in vitro models and in vivo models to analyze the crosstalk between FGF23 and klotho and their
effect on cell senescence in the airway epithelium. In addition, we will employ the COPDGene cohort to
translate these findings to determine their relevance in individuals with COPD.
Both FGF23 and klotho have been associated with chronic airway inflammation and accelerated aging in
COPD and we hypothesize that a dysregulated klotho/FGF23 â€˜rheostatâ€™ contributes to airway epithelial cell
senescence. We therefore propose to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms in order to identify
future novel therapeutic targets.
Aim 1 will investigate the impact of increased FGF23 signaling on airway epithelial cell senescence by primary
human airway epithelial cell cultures and mice, deficient in klotho or overexpressing klotho and expose them to
cigarette smoke Â± FGF23.
Aim 2 will determine the underlying molecular mechanisms on accelerated airway aging in individuals with
COPD and characterize klotho and FGF23 as prognostic aging markers by using the COPDGene cohort with
access to plasma samples and de-identified clinical data.
Overall, this proposal will identify a novel pathway involved in airway epithelial cell senescence leading to
smoke induced lung diseases such as COPD and therefore open novel therapeutic options in diseases that are
on the rise due to an aging population.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to increasing life expectancy in combination with exposure to
environmental pollutants and cigarette smoke, COPD is becoming a rising problem and therefore, novel
therapeutic approaches, â€œanti-aging strategiesâ€, are needed. We propose a translational approach to
investigate signaling pathways of two proteins and their crosstalk: 1) Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, a pro-

5R01HL138023-02,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Exosome in Efferocytosis of Apoptotic Cardiomyocytes and Repair after Myocardial Ischemia,"Summary
Cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of mortality in patients with
diabetes. In infarcted heart, efficient clearance of dying cells (called efferocytosis) by activated
neighboring phagocytes (primarily infiltrating macrophages) is essential for inflammation resolution and
tissue repair. However, improper clearance of dying cells leads to secondary postapoptotic necrosis and
therefore may precipitate the transition to heart failure. Our preliminary study demonstrates that diabetic
condition impairs efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes by macrophages, in vitro and in human diabetic
heart as compared to non-diabetics. However, the molecular players in diabetes-mediated defective
efferocytosis and its effect on cardiac remodeling and outcome are surprisingly not studied yet. Therefore,
studying the mechanisms of diabetes-mediated impairment in efferocytosis of dead cells (specifically
cardiomyocytes) and strategies to enhance resolution of inflammation leading to efficient cardiac healing
and recovery are clinically relevant and therapeutically novel. In this regard, therapy with paracrine
factors (exosomes) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a potent immunomodulator and clinically tested
for safety and efficacy in ischemic heart failure patients, holds great promise. However, the effect of MSC
and its derivatives on macrophage efferocytosis of cardiomyocytes either with or without diabetes in a
small/larger animal model of MI has never been studied so far. Our preliminary data shows that MSC-
derived exosomes increase macrophage efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes, in vitro. Based on these
preliminary data coupled with our published and existing literature, our central hypothesis is that i)
diabetes impairs macrophage efferocytosis of dead cardiomyocytes leading to delay in resolution of
inflammation and cardiac repair in diabetics, ii) MSC-derived exosomes are enriched in factors
(RNA/miRNA/proteins) that promote efferocytosis, therefore iii) intramyocardial delivery of MSC-
derived exosomes in a small/large animal model of MI enhances efferocytosis and wound healing leading
to efficient regeneration and repair. We will test our hypotheses under the following three aims:
Aim 1: Determine the effect of diabetes on clearance of dead cardiomyocyte (efferocytosis) after
myocardial ischemic injury.
Aim 2: Elucidate the molecular mechanism of MSC-exosome effect on macrophage-mediated
efferocytosis.
Aim 3: a. Delineate the invivo effect of MSC-exosome on efferocytosis after myocardial infarction a) in
mice and b) in a translationally realistic large animal (pig) model of heart failure.","Narrative

Basic Research Core (Core H)
The technological advancements of the last two decades in the area of biomedical research have been nothing
short of breathtaking and are propelling the generation of detailed knowledge at an ever increasing speed.
Access to these technologies is key for cutting-edge research programs, however, no single laboratory can
cover the breadth of the now available high-end research tools and provide complete expertise.
The mission of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Basic
Research Core (BRC) is thus to maximize the benefits of key technology by providing the necessary
instrumentation and services within a well-organized, centralized, facility that is capable of handling potentially
infectious material.
For this purpose, we have used the last funding period to expand the high-tech service portfolio of the core
from a flow cytometry centered operation to an operation that now also offers access to services for ATAC-seq,
RNA-seq and kinome analysis. To assist those without laboratory experience or access, we provide sample
preparation services for all methods. The BRC has installed a task-specific bioinformatics pipeline that QCs all
data sets and provides network analysis based signal pathway description/identification or target prioritization
for interested users. More detailed analysis can be provided by UAB's Bioinformatics Institute.
To optimize the synergy between the service components and reduce redundancy, we further included the
operation of the previous virology core into the BRC. This component provides a tangible collection of HIV
clones, lenti- and retroviral vectors as well as engineered cell lines that were generated for projects by UAB
researchers and the engagement of the core leaders Drs. Kappes and Ochsenbauer with national HIV-1
research initiatives such as CHAVI or IAVI. Lastly, we seized a unique opportunity provided by the
establishment of the HIV+ to HIV+ transplant donor program at UAB, one of only 13 such programs in the
USA, and established a HIV+ donor tissue procurement and processing facility. Reliable access to lymphoid
and other tissues from HIV+ donors will massively expand our understanding of immune function and actual
dysfunction in HIV patients. In its current form, the BRC now provides complete tissue, tool and analytical
services supply chain to our users.
The critical impact of the BRC is demonstrated by its productivity. During the last funding period, support by the
BRC helped CFAR researchers that had HIV-related NIH funding publish over 130 papers. Obviously, the
number of supported publications is much higher, as the components of the BRC not only supported 38 HIV-
related grants (and 10 developmental awards), but also mostly through the flow cytometry component, 80 non-
HIV-related grants. The core supported a total of 86 Principal investigators that were funded by 13 different

5R01AI122842-03,Overcoming HIV-1 transcriptional latency in unresponsive CD4 T cells,"ABSTRACT
 Latent HIV-1 infection has been recognized as a major obstacle to the development of a curative HIV-1
therapy, but host cell-virus interactions that control latent infection are still ill defined. Key to this application is
the realization that the host cells of latent HIV-1 infection events are actually phenotypically altered in a manner
that (i) forces the virus into a latent state and that (ii) renders the host cells unresponsive to stimulation,
thereby preventing efficient therapeutic induction of HIV-1 reactivation. These changes go beyond a simple
quiescent state that is characteristic for functional memory T cells. This proposal will extend on these findings
and seek to address three major roadblocks in the field of HIV latency research. Roadblock #1 (Aim 1)
concerns our inability to identify biomarkers that specifically define T cell sub-populations in which latently
infected T cells are highly enriched. Such biomarkers would allow us to detail the molecular biology of the host
cell state that enables and maintains latent HIV-1 infection. Leading to this application, we found that the
intracellular changes allowing latent HIV-1 infected to persist are associated with a unique CD4+CD28â€“
CD9+CD151+ phenotype, a T cell phenotype that also demarcates a small CD4 T cell sub-population that is
increased in HIV patients on ART. We already demonstrate that CD151 expression by itself is associated with
reservoir capacity. We will now detail the viral reservoir capacity of T cell sub-populations described by CD28,
CD151 and CD9 expression. Roadblock #2 (Aim 2) addressed in this application is the question how the
intracellular changes observed in host cells of latent HIV infection events act (i) to control HIV transcription and
and (ii) to suppress T cell responsiveness. In addition to the proposed research on host-cell factors/networks
controlling latent HIV infection, we already have identified several targets/interaction networks that control
latent infection and that will be immediately probed. We will further address roadblock #3 (Aim 3), the question
why stimulation of ex vivo T cell material from HIV patients seems to only trigger HIV-1 reactivation in a small
fraction of the latently HIV-infected cells. Based on our results, we predict that T cell subpopulations described
by differential CD28, CD9 and CD151 expression patterns, will exhibit varying levels of unresponsiveness to
stimulation, allowing latent HIV infection to persist with different efficacies. Based on the results we have
obtained leading to this application and the additional results we will generate, we will immediately begin to
rationally design compound-based intervention strategies that would (i) first reconstitute T cell responsiveness
in reservoir populations and then (ii) trigger efficient HIV reactivation, a prerequisite for any HIV-1 eradication
strategy and the ultimate goal of this application.","NARRATIVE
Latent HIV-1 infection represents the principal obstacle to a curative AIDS therapy. Previous attempts to
therapeutically eradicate these latent HIV-1 reservoirs have failed, creating a need to identify novel HIV-1
reactivating therapeutic strategies to eliminate this reservoir. We propose to combine the use of new
biomarkers that could define latently HIV-1 infected reservoir T cell populations with an integrative systems
biology approach that generates data describing the complex interactions of cellular factors that control latent
HIV-1 infection with the goal to identify novel HIV-1 reactivating drug targets.",2019,650499,481215,169284,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases,OLAF  KUTSCH
5R61AI133679-03,Identification of drugs that induce terminal transcriptional silencing of latent HIV-1 infection,"As it is becoming increasingly clear that currently pursued HIV-1 reactivating strategies may not result
in therapeutic HIV-1 eradication, alternative eradication strategies need to be explored. We here propose to
develop terminal transcriptional silencing (TTS) strategies specific for latent HIV-1 infection events. TTS
strategies would have their biological equivalent in retro/lentiviral silencing. However, TTS would not target de
novo infection events, but have to transcriptionally silence pre-existing, latent provirus in the absence of viral
proteins, mostly RNA or non-integrated DNA that usually trigger the antiviral cellular response. Evidence for
the existence of cellular innate immune mechanisms that specifically target lentiviral infection is provided by
the fact that lentiviral silencing is a major roadblock for lentiviral-based gene therapy. The existence of innate
cellular defense mechanisms that can control pre-existing virus-style genome expression is suggested by the
existence of defense mechanisms against a related, evolutionary ancient class of â€œgenomic intrudersâ€ called
retrotransposons. These defense mechanisms individually evolved in response to each different
retrotransposon class. Unfortunately, because of this specificity, mechanisms that continuously actively control
retrotransposons to suppress their genomic spread, actually are inactive against HIV-1. Specificity of TTS
strategies against HIV-1 infection is essential as, beyond the general consideration of toxicity issues of any
drug intervention, TTS strategies cannot cause (i) any interference with innate control mechanisms that
suppress retrotransposon activity or cause (ii) any interference with mechanisms that control epigenetic
silencing of genes in human cells. For the R61 phase, we propose an iterative approach that combines high
content analysis methods (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, kinome array analysis) with pharmacological perturbation
screens to identify drug targets that specifically control the cellular innate antiviral response to HIV-1 infection.
The proposed research will take advantage of (i) a preexisting, large selection of HIV-1 reporter cells, (ii) the
finding that certain clinical HIV-1 and in particular HIV-2 strains cause a much more potent innate TTS
response than the commonly used laboratory adapted HIV-1 clones, and (iii) the finding that macrophages are
much more efficient in executing TTS than T cells. The deliverable of the R61 phase will be (1) the
identification of druggable targets that if pharmacologically addressed, enable TTS in latently HIV-1 infected T
cells and (2) HTS-compatible drug screening assays for the identification of TTS-inducing drugs against these
targets. In the R33 phase, we will perform the actual drug screens to identify TTS-inducing compounds.
Identified candidate compounds would be tested in primary cell models of latent infection and cell material
derived from HIV-1 patients. By the end of the R33 phase we expect to have identified at least one clinically
relevant TTS strategy comprising of one or several drugs.","All cells have an innate, intrinsic ability to defend against viral infections. In this application we seek to
identify drugs or drug combinations that that restore this antiviral response in latently HIV-1 infected cells and
allow the cells to permanently silence the expression of any viral products, a therapy approach that we call
terminal transcriptional silencing. Our proposal provides a first-in-class example of HIV-1 reservoir eradication
without the need of HIV-1 reactivation.",2019,657007,442429,214578,Non-SBIR/STTR,R61,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Human Genome; Infectious Diseases,OLAF  KUTSCH
5R01EY027857-03,Perceptual mechanisms underlying reading difficulties in glaucoma,"PROPJECT SUMMARY
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), characterized by progressive neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion
cells and associated visual field defects, is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. The
predominant view has been that glaucoma spares central visual function until the end-stages. However,
accumulating evidence shows that the macula is involved in even early glaucomatous damage, including a
significant reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer and/or ganglion cell layer thickness. In parallel with
physiological evidence, behavioral evidence shows that functional deficits in various central vision tasks,
such as reading and face recognition, often appear in individuals with glaucoma. Surprisingly, reading
problems have been cited as a main source of anxiety among people with glaucoma. However, at present,
we have no understanding of how glaucomatous damage impedes pattern recognition in the assumed-to-
be-preserved central visual field. Nor do we know of effective means to alleviate these deficits. Even when
treatment controls disease progression, individuals with existing visual field defects need to cope with
compromised vision. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms limiting everyday visual function in
glaucoma is important from both clinical and basic science perspectives. The proposed study will build on
the empirical findings from our preliminary work and theoretical work from several decades of human
pattern vision in order to make fundamental advances in our understanding of central visual function of
glaucoma. The major goals of the proposed research are to understand how glaucoma undermines central
pattern vision and to apply this knowledge to guiding the development of effective rehabilitative strategies to
optimize the remaining vision of people with glaucoma. In particular, our specific aims are (1) To understand
the impact of glaucomatous damage on central pattern recognition, (2) To understand the role of the spatial
pattern of visual field defects, (3) To apply perceptual learning to reading rehabilitation of individuals with
glaucoma. To date, very little attention has been paid to such research. The outcome of the current
research proposal is expected to help us understand the limiting factors underlying daily visual function in
glaucoma and identify potential rehabilitative interventions. Furthermore, the knowledge obtained from the
proposed research will provide new insights on how retinal ganglion cell pathology affects human pattern
recognition.

Project Summary/Abstract
This exploratory study will examine the current state of fertility preservation (FP) counseling for women with
cystic fibrosis (CF) from the perspectives of the 3Ps (Patient, Partner, and Provider) with the goal of identifying
the gaps, barriers, and facilitators in clinical practice in order to develop FP guidelines for women with CF,
broaden their reproductive options, and improve their reproductive health outcomes. This study aims to: (1)
explore the knowledge, experiences, preferences, and concerns of women with CF related to FP as a
reproductive option prior to lung transplantation; (2) explore the knowledge, experiences, preferences, and
concerns of partners of women with CF related to FP as a reproductive option prior to lung transplantation; and
(3) explore the knowledge, practices, and attitudes of CF providers related to FP counseling in women with CF
prior to lung transplantation.
With advances in early diagnosis and management, CF is no longer considered a disease of childhood, and
people with CF are living into adulthood, with the average survival age of the mid-40s. Half of the CF
population are women, many of whom want to engage in all developmental milestones, including motherhood.
For the subset of women with severe lung disease who are being evaluated for a lung transplant, there are no
published studies on whether CF providers discuss FP with them. While FP counseling is part of
comprehensive care in the oncology population undergoing radiation and/or chemotherapy, there are no
clinical guidelines for those with non-malignant conditions.
Using a mixed methods design, a cross-sectional survey will be administered to examine the FP knowledge,
experiences preferences, and concerns of adult Patients (n=50) and their Partners (n=30), and FP knowledge,
practices, and attitudes of CF Providers (n=50). An interview with a subset of Patients (n= 20), Partners
(n=20), and CF Providers (n=20) will be conducted to supplement the quantitative results and more fully
understand the current state of FP counseling for women with CF and their partners pre-lung transplantation.

5R01MH113800-02,Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,"ABSTRACT
 Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological
mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic
drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being
partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily
dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those
with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments.
We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naÃ¯ve first
episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.
 We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we
can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early
compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By
characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will
further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.
 We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naÃ¯ve and treat them with
the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment
response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another
APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of
treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3)
MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using
several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment
response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying
pathologies in those with poor response.
 Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific
targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients
characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1K08HL141652-01A1,Mechanisms of Pulmonary Microbiota-Induced Inflammation and Vascular Dysfunction in Neonatal Lung Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 This revised NIH K08 proposal describes a 5-year training and research plan for the candidate, a physician
scientist with a long term goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of neonatal pulmonary
biology with expertise in understanding the role of the pulmonary microbiome in chronic lung disease of
prematurity. To accomplish this goal, he and his mentoring committee put forth an integrated career
development plan encompassing a novel research idea.
 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common pulmonary morbidity in extremely preterm infants is
initiated by injury to the immature lung by early neutrophil influx, collagen degradation, remodeling, and arterial
thickening. The candidate has discovered that the airways of newborn infants are not sterile but are occupied by
a diverse microbiome even at birth, and that the microbiome is altered (dysbiosis) during the development of
BPD. He has also recently discovered the role of exosomal microRNAs in BPD prediction and pathogenesis.
His mentors have previously established that the tripeptide N-acetyl proline-glycine-proline (Ac-PGP) derived
from the breakdown of the ECM plays a critical role in various chronic lung diseases by enhancing neutrophilic
inflammation and endothelial permeability. The preliminary data in this proposal indicate that the airways of
infants with BPD which have increased Gammaproteobacteria (Â¡-Proteobacteria) also have increased levels of
Ac-PGP. Moreover, gain of Ac-PGP function creates the phenotype of BPD in murine models, whereas loss of
Ac-PGP function reverses the BPD phenotype. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and prolyl endopeptidase
(PE) degrade collagen, leading to the release of Ac-PGP. MMP9 and PE are top predicted targets of exosomal
miR 548m and miR 129-1-3 respectively and both these miRs are reduced in BPD. Collectively, these findings
lead to the novel mechanistic hypothesis that Â¡-Proteobacteria-induced reduction in exosomal miRs
increase protease levels which in turn increase Ac-PGP release and cause chronic neutrophilic
inflammation and vascular dysfunction in BPD. In addition to determining these mechanisms (Aim 1), the
candidate will conduct a human study using independent â€˜Discoveryâ€™ and â€˜Validationâ€™ cohorts of extremely
preterm infants to test the hypothesis that decreased exosomal miRs 548m and miR 129- 1-3p and increased
MMP9, PE and Ac-PGP, in relation to a dysbiotic airway microbota are early predictors of severe BPD (Aim 2).
Thus the work proposed in this research proposal will generate novel information about the mechanisms of
microbiota induced neutrophilic inflammation and vascular dysfunction in BPD, and will determine novel early
biomarkers for BPD.
 The candidate has already assembled a research advisory committee with complementary intellect and
content expertise that can guide him throughout the award period. In addition, the candidate will obtain didactic
education to gain requisite knowledge culminating in the awarding of an MSPH degree. Through this integrated
mentoring and didactic plan, the candidate will gain skill and expertise in pulmonary inflammation, microbial
pathogenesis, microRNA and exosomal molecular biology, microbiome sequencing, bioinformatics, skills in
manipulation of germ free mouse models and research ethics. This will enable the him to develop an
independent research program and obtain NIH R01 funding.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

5R25GM129867-02,Filtered: a story-driven digital learning platform for bioinformatics and infectious disease ,"Abstract
Filtered introduces students and teachers to the biological concepts and logical thinking skills used in the
bioinformatics analysis of human and viral genomes. Bioinformatics employs computational tools to store,
manage and query biological data, weaving together engineering, biology, computer science, statistics and
mathematics. It is a key component of modern clinical research and patient care. Although bioinformatics
concepts are often incorporated in high school life science courses, there is a lack of available educational
resources to effectively address key learning targets. To fill this gap, the HudsonAlpha Institute for
Biotechnology is developing a bioinformatics-based serious game called Filtered, which takes place during a
pandemic. Played on a tablet, mobile device or through a web browser, students become entry-level
bioinformaticians employed by a laboratory searching for genomic insights into a deadly virus and the small
group of humans seemingly resistant to infection. Through gameplay, students are introduced to a series of
core biological concepts, reinforced through bioinformatics tools that align DNA sequences, call genetic
variants, compare sequences across evolutionary history, and determine the impact of sequence changes. A
series of puzzles allows students to recognize the tool's purpose, strengths and weaknesses. Once students
master the tools, they can appropriately classify the virus, identify human variants that confer resistance to
infection, and propose a treatment option to halt the pandemic.
Online written and multimedia materials support students and educators, and link the content to workforce
opportunities in genome analysis and other aspects of bioinformatics. Educator resources include content
primers and extensions, links to national and other standards, sample lesson plans, guides for classroom use,
and suggested assessment strategies. Professional development includes pedagogical training in using
Filtered as well as content-deepening sessions on bioinformatics, genome analysis and evolution. The
implementation plan focuses on high school biology classrooms. Special emphasis is given to training
educators who work with typically underrepresented populations, including students of African-American and/or
Hispanic ethnicity as well as those in inner-city or rural areas.
Filtered allows students to approach real-world problems using 21st century skills, pulling multiple lines of
evidence from molecular biology, human genetics, population biology and evolution as they draw connections
between their classroom lessons, personal interests and present-day applications.","Narrative

5R01CA200979-04,RADIOLABELED ANTIBODIES TARGETING LAT1 FOR IMAGING AND THERAPY OF PROSTATE CANCER,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The L-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1, SLC7A5) is an outstanding target for both imaging and therapy of prostate cancer because it is upregulated in many primary and metastatic prostate cancers and is strongly negatively correlated with overall survival. The current paradigm for imaging LAT1 uses radiolabeled amino acids that are transported into tumor cells to a greater extent than normal tissues. However, these substrate-based approaches for imaging LAT1 in tumors outside of the brain have met with limited success. LAT1 can mediate both influx and efflux of its substrates, leading to relatively low and transient uptake in tumors with poor tumor visualization. The specificity of anti-LAT1 antibodies will provide a more accurate measure of LAT1 protein density than the currently available system L transport substrates, which are not entirely selective for LAT1. This increased selectivity is important because LAT1 is the transporter that provides the greatest prognostic and predictive values. The overall goal of this project is to develop and evaluate radiolabeled antibody constructs selective for LAT1 as positron emission tomography (PET) and therapeutic agents that overcome the substantial limitations of currently available tracers. The development of these new agents is essential to realizing the full potential of LAT1-based imaging and treatment strategies. The long-term goal of this work is to develop clinically applicable imaging and therapeutic agents targeting LAT1 that possess optimal biological properties, are robust markers of prostate tumor aggressiveness, predict response to therapies targeting LAT1, and can be used for radio immunotherapy (RIT). Building on our previous work, we aim to investigate the tumor uptake of the anti-LAT1 immunoPET agent [89Zr] DFO-Ab2 in relevant prostate cancer models. Next, we will compare the uptake of these novel agents to the radiolabeled amino acids [18F] FET and [18F] FACBC. Finally, we will develop a theranostic strategy to visualize LAT1 levels through immunoPET followed by therapy with the anti-LAT1 antibody constructs labeled with 90Y, a therapeutic radionuclide. In addition to providing clinically relevant immunoPET and RIT agents, this work will lead to powerful and well characterized new tools for investigating the role of LAT1 in cancer biology that cannot be performed with currently available radiolabeled amino acids. Thus, the immunoPET and RIT agents developed through this proposal are highly innovative, have great potential for clinical impact, and can help investigators around the world answer clinical and basic research questions regarding the role of LAT1 in cancer biology that cannot be currently addressed with existing technologies.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The expression of the neutral amino acid transporter LAT1 expression is negatively correlated with overall survival in prostate cancer. A method to accurately measure the levels of LAT1 in cancer will help identify patients at high risk for poor outcome and select the most appropriate therapeutic approach.

4R00CA215604-03,Quantitative PET Imaging for Oncologic Immune Response Prediction,"Abstract
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly improved overall survival in a number of cancers, which
has in turn sparked tremendous scientific and financial investment into further expansion of this treatment
paradigm. Currently, however, the benefits of immunotherapy have only been realized in a minority of patients.
Further complicating the issue, many immunotherapies carry risks of severe adverse immune events, and
methods to detect therapeutic efficacy such as anatomical staging and 18F-FDG PET imaging are confounded
by the potential presence of immune infiltrate. These invading immune cells can cause potentially responding
tumors to increase in size and in 18F-FDG consumption, which make them indistinguishable from progressing
malignancies. Because of the lack of current diagnostic capabilities, the only option many patients undergoing
immunotherapy have to determine if they are responding is overall survival, which is a long and potentially
dangerous approach to determining therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, given the increasing number of drugs
and combinations being clinically trialed, the ability to monitor therapeutic efficacy at an earlier stage would
potentially help bring new treatments to approval much faster. Currently, there is no approved biomarker for
determining therapeutic efficacy, and biopsy analysis of tumor markers such as PD-L1 prior to treatment have
only resulted in modest improvements of outcome. Thus a biomarker that predicted response would permit
significant advances in both the pre-clinical and clinical investigations.
 Granzyme B, which is secreted by T effector cells following activation and acts as a potent inducer of
apoptosis, is a strong predictor of immunotherapy response. I have developed a novel and selective PET
imaging peptide that detects the secreted and active form of granzyme B, permitting differentiation between
active response to immunotherapy and non-response in which â€œexhaustedâ€ T cells that contain granzyme B
may be present but are not actively secreting the enzyme. PET imaging with the granzyme B peptide permits
highly sensitive and specific prediction of response to immunotherapy prior to changes in tumor volume in
murine syngeneic models of cancer. This phenotype is not limited to mice, as human samples analyzed both
by antibody and my peptide show significantly higher levels of granzyme B in responding versus non-
responding patients. Thus, granzyme B PET imaging offers a unique insight into early response that is not
currently possible using any other technique. Current methods cannot accurately define a response prior to
destructive sampling, as a response is defined as lack of progression. Given these limitations, I am proposing
to use granzyme B PET imaging to stratify mice based on granzyme B levels, followed by biochemical and
genetic analysis of responding and non-responding tumors. The non-invasive nature of PET imaging will not
only provide accurate differentiation of response prior to any anatomic changes, but will also allow for
secondary therapeutic manipulations based on initial PET imaging results.","Project Narrative
Immune checkpoint inhibitors activate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, and have
markedly advanced treatment options for patients with a broad variety of cancers. However, standard imaging
methods are often not useful in response assessment of immune modulators due to a lack of change in tumor
size or metabolic activity with an immune cell infiltrate. To address this unmet clinical and research need, a
novel PET imaging approach will be utilized to measure T cell activation within a tumor as a new imaging
paradigm for tumoral response evaluation to immune modulators.",2019,247942,166964,80978,Non-SBIR/STTR,R00,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Immunization; Immunotherapy; Precision Medicine; Vaccine Related,Benjamin M Larimer
4R00HG009678-02,Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,"The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive
training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics
to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in
genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training,
followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration
of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic
research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information
captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate
clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic
data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2)
improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and
reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny
application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data
integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers
for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will
be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future
studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to
capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively,
this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches
and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers
(HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to
complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold

The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for
this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art
computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's
training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a
strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics
research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center.","Project Narrative

1F32AG062048-01A1,Mechanisms of Human Skeletal Muscle Motor Unit Remodeling in Parkinson's Disease,"ABSTRACT
Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a leading neurodegenerative disease among aging adults, affecting ~1% of the
population over age 65. The well-established root cause of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra pars compacta, part of the basal ganglia in the midbrain, leading to the classic motor symptoms (tremor,
bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, gait problems) and a host of non-motor symptoms (e.g., depression,
anxiety, sleep disorders, loss of smell, and cognitive decline). Prior to our laboratoryâ€™s recent work, it was
unknown whether PD progression extended to a unique phenotype in limb skeletal muscles. We found an
exaggerated pathological grouping of type I (slow, oxidative) myofibers in PD thigh muscle compared to age-
matched non-PD peers. More severe type I grouping in PD was associated with exaggerated motor unit
activation during weight-bearing tasks (i.e., sit-to-stand), indicating increased physiologic difficulty, along with a
worsened mobility scores, suggesting that type I myofiber grouping may contribute to or progress along with the
classic motor symptoms of PD. Abnormal type I grouping is indicative of heightened rates of denervation-
reinnervation cycling, with denervated myofibers characterized by recapitulated expression of developmental
factors [e.g., neonatal voltage-gated sodium channel 1.5 (Nav1.5) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)].
In our recent work, type I grouping in PD was accompanied by elevated Nav1.5 mRNA expression and differential
mRNA and/or protein expression of key components involved in regulating neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
stability. In a recent transcriptome-wide RNA-Seq investigation, we further demonstrated that the degree of type
I myofiber grouping was linked to gene expression networks involved in neuromuscular communication, neural
development, and cell adhesion and survival. We previously found that high-intensity resistance exercise
rehabilitation training (RT) successfully reversed several pathologies of PD, including type I myofiber grouping.
We suspect this change is likely mediated by molecular transducers regulating NMJ stability, such as microRNAs
(miRNAs), which have recently emerged as cross-tissue mediators of gene expression. In further support, a
number of muscle-expressed miRNAs associated with type I myofiber grouping in our recent work target genes
associated with neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance. These combined findings raise the
central hypothesis that the extreme motor unit remodeling phenotype seen in PD, and its partial reversal with
RT, will be linked to differentially expressed miRNA networks in conjunction with alterations in the prevalence of
denervated myofibers. We will test this hypothesis with two aims. Aim 1: We will identify serum exosome-isolated
miRNAs unique to PD and determine the impact of 16 wk RT on this miRNA expression profile using small RNA-
Seq. Aim 2: We will quantify the magnitude and distribution of denervated myofibers from our PD replicate
cohort, enabling us to determine the impact of 16 wk RT. This research is expected to markedly advance the
field, while providing innovative and fruitful training and career development for the applicant.","Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) affects ~1% of the population over 65y, and there is currently no treatment to
completely reverse the motor symptoms that eventually progress toward cognitive decline, dementia, and loss
of independence in the vast majority of those with PD. However, exercise training is a potent rehabilitative
therapy in individuals with PD, and preliminary data suggest that these benefits are likely reflected by
improvements in the muscle molecular environment and accompanying phenotypic changes that facilitate
neuromuscular junction stability. Further examination of putative contributors to exercise-induced improvements
in physiological functioning in PD (e.g., post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and skeletal muscle
fiber denervation-reinnervation cycling) will enable enhanced application of exercise as an adjuvant treatment to
improve motor function and overall quality of life in this population.",2019,57380,57380,,"Training, Individual",F32,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation,Kaleen M Lavin

Core D will implement hyperspectral imaging technologies, image analysis approaches, and mathematical
modeling to answer questions concerning the time course and spatial spread of cellular signals and
subsequent regulation of endothelial function. Core D will support all PROJECTS by providing spectral analysis
of the molecular composition of tissues, enabling quantitative imaging of localized intracellular signals and
implementing novel image processing, data analysis, and mathematical modeling approaches.
Service component: Core D will provide capabilities for next-generation imaging, image analysis, quantitative
data extraction, mathematical modeling, and data storage and retrieval to support all projects and cores. In
specific, Core D will 1) provide expertise and assistance in implementing next-generation 5-dimensional
imaging (x,y,z,t,Î») approaches; 2) develop customized analysis approaches for extracting localized signaling
information from 5-dimensional image data; 3) assist in creating mathematical models of signaling pathways to
aid in hypothesis testing and generation; and 4) manage a central repository for image and modeling data
storage that will facilitate cross-project collaboration and data mining.
Academic component: The investigators of Core D will continue to develop new technologies for next-
generation hyperpsectral, high-speed microscopy. As these microscope systems are implemented, Core D will
provide access to and training on the new imaging technologies. During the upcoming cycle, Core D will focus
on implementing several high-speed hyperspectral imaging technologies that are currently in the late stages of
prototype development. Access to these technologies will enable project investigators to take the next step in
studying pulmonary vasculature on a cellular and biosystems level (for example, simultaneous subcellular
measurements of Ca2+-cGMP-NO, or assessing cAMP in whole tissue constructs and intravitally).
Synergy with projects and scientific cores: Core D will serve as a hub for project synergy by implementing
cross-project quantitative imaging, analysis, and modeling approaches and by ensuring that all image and
modeling data is archived and maintained in a central database (repository). The quantitative nature of 5D
imaging and the ability to access data from experiments across multiple projects will further build synergy. For
example, we can quantitatively assess whether Ca2+ influx through T-type channels in response to a 20 second
depolarization is sufficient to modulate sAC and AC6 activity at designated subcellular locations and to effect
changes in cAMP and endothelial barrier integrity. Thus, the quantitative nature of Core D provides a
framework for interweaving imaging and modeling studies performed by all projects.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5K23HL127100-05,Chronobiology and Chronopharmacology to Prevent Sickle Cell Nephropathy,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance of proposed research: Untreated hypertension and renal injury are risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality in sickle cell
disease, yet early markers of progressive disease have not been identified and therapies to prevent the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes have not been defined. Circadian blood pressure, as defined by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, is more accurate than clinic blood pressure in defining secondary hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressured dipping has been linked to progressive renal disease in other diseases.    
   
Methodology/Aims: A randomized feasibility trial of losartan will be conducted among 40 adolescent HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (11-19 years) with abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dipping. During this six month feasibility trial, two dosing strategies of losartan (titraed to keep BP <95th percentile vs. <75th percentile) will be analyzed for safety and effect on restoring normal circadian blood pressure. A prospective cohort study among HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (6-19 years) will also be conducted to evaluate the incidence of hypertension and role of monitoring potential biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Cohort participants will undergo annual evaluations of hypertension and markers of kidney injury (24 hour blood pressure monitoring for participants = 11yrs; Blood: uric acid; Urine: Cystatin-c, Kim-1, NGAL, B2M). Expected Results: At the completion of the feasibility trial, vital background information will be obtained to design a definitive multicenter trial of hypertension in sickle cel disease. At the completion of the cohort study, the incidence of pediatric hypertension will be identified and the role for monitoring blood and urine biomarkers will be better understood.    
   
As therapy for patients with renal failure is dismal, it is imperative that SCD patients at risk ar identified early and that therapeutic trials are conducted that prevent progression.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hypertension is a known risk factor for stroke in sickle cell disease and in other diseases associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Within the context of a feasibility trial, this proposal will develop vital background data to understand the acceptability of, adherence to, and dosing strategy for losartan prior to conducting a definitive trial for adolescent sickle cell disease patients with abnormal circadian blood pressure.

5R03HL144485-02,Acute Kidney Injury During Sickle Cell Crisis,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients suffer from repeated episodes of vaso-occlusive pain crisis and acute chest
syndrome, yet data is lacking on the impact of these clinical events on progressive end-organ damage,
including kidney injury. Cell free heme and hemoglobin can be elevated during these hemolytic events.
Murine models suggest that an acute increase in cell free heme and hemoglobin from a hemolytic event will
mediate kidney injury. As it is well recognized the patients with sickle cell suffer from a higher prevalence of
developing kidney injury, it is vital to conduct research to determine the impact of hemolysis during acute SCD
crisis (pain crisis or acute chest syndrome) on the development of kidney injury. We hypothesize that during
SCD crisis, kidney injury occurs and is associated with elevations in cell free heme/hemoglobin and endothelin-
1 levels.
Methodology and Aims: Patients with HbSS and SB0 thalassemia (ages 6-20) admitted for SCD crisis (pain
crisis or acute chest syndrome) will consent to daily first morning urine and blood collection. Urine samples will
be measured for acute kidney injury biomarkers and blood will be measured for cell free heme, hemoglobin,
and endothelin-1. To understand the epidemiology of SCD crisis associated AKI, we will determine the
frequency of AKI as defined by the KDIGO definition (rise in serum creatinine of 0.3mg/dL or 50% from
baseline, or decrease in urine output). We will perform analysis of potential risk factors for kidney injury
including changes in blood counts from baseline and administration of NSAIDs or other nephrotoxic
medications. Second, we still study the pathophysiology of kidney injury during SCD crisis. We will determine
the associations between elevations in cell free heme/hemoglobin and endothelin-1 with the development of
clinical AKI (defined by KDIGO) or subclinical AKI (elevation in urinary biomarkers without a rise in serum
creatinine).
Expected results: At the completion of this R03 proposal, we will establish an association linking hemolysis
during SCD with the development of kidney injury. As sickle cell patients are at increased risk for mortality
from chronic kidney disease, it is imperative to better understand the impact of repeated sickle cell crisis on
kidney injury so that diagnostic, therapeutic, and supportive care protocols for monitoring and preventing AKI
during SCD crisis can be developed.","Project Narrative
Patients with sickle cell disease can suffer from repeated acute chest syndrome events and vaso-occlusive
crises that may be triggered by or associated with an acute drop in hemoglobin (hemolysis). Acute kidney
injury can occur during these sickle cell crises and may be associated with hemolysis. As acute kidney injury
is a risk factor for development of CKD in other disease and sickle cell patients have a high prevalence of

acute kidney injury, and progression to CKD.",2019,74250,50000,24250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Hematology; Kidney Disease; Pain Research; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Sickle Cell Disease,Jeffrey D Lebensburger
5R01HL139692-02,Hemodynamic Adaptation and Vascular Remodeling in Fistula Development,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The vascular access is the lifeline for the hemodialysis patient. The most common etiology of vascular access
dysfunction in hemodialysis patients is failure of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to mature successfully for
dialysis use (AVF maturation failure). At present, there remains a very high rate of AVF maturation failure in the
United States and there are no effective treatments to enhance AVF maturation. On a radiologic level, AVF
maturation failure is most commonly characterized by a stenosis at the venous anastomosis, and at a
histological level it is characterized by a combination of aggressive neointimal hyperplasia and poor outward
remodeling. The poor outcomes following AVF creation reflect our limited understanding of the mechanisms
leading to AVF maturation failure; and the lack of therapies to treat this clinical problem represent an unmet
clinical need. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(NOS3)/nitric oxide (NO) system in AVF development. Preliminary work from our rodent AVF models has
demonstrated: (1) impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (decreased NOS3-derived NO
bioavailability) at the AVF anastomosis, (2) poor hemodynamic adaptation and biological responses in the
setting of NOS3 dysfunction, (3) increased AVF neointimal hyperplasia and matrix metalloproteinase
production in the setting of chronic kidney disease, and (4) reduced neointimal hyperplasia and improved
vascular biological responses to a NO-releasing bionanomatrix gel applied directly at the AVF anastomosis
during AVF creation. Based on these preliminary studies, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
NOS3/NO system plays a critical role in successful AVF maturation by regulating local vascular hemodynamic
adaptation and vascular biological responses after AVF creation; and locally delivered NO therapies applied at
the AVF anastomosis can improve these two processes. Using our murine and rat AVF models, we will test our
central hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) To determine how the NOS3 system modulates hemodynamic
adaptation and biological responses during AVF maturation and (2) To evaluate the effect of a nitric oxide-
releasing nanomatrix gel administered locally at the AVF anastomosis during AVF creation on enhancing AVF
development. We believe our proposed research is significant because: (1) it addresses a very important
clinical problem in hemodialysis patients, AVF maturation failure, where there are presently no effective
therapies and (2) examines a fundamentally important system in AVF development, the NOS3/NO system.
Successful completion of these aims will identify important targets for developing innovative therapies that aim
to modify the NOS3/NO system in order to enhance AVF maturation. Our results will also have broad
implications for other vascular conditions such as peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, and
postangioplasty restenosis.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because of the majority of arteriovenous fistulas created in

5I01BX003387-03,The Role of Endothelial Dysfunction in Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation,"Â 
Â 
Project Summary/Abstract
The vascular access is the â€œAchilles Heelâ€ of the hemodialysis procedure. Sixty percent of arteriovenous
fistulas (AVF) that are created fail to mature successfully for dialysis use (AVF non-maturation), resulting in a
very significant clinical morbidity and mortality for hemodialysis patients. On a radiologic level, AVF non-
maturation is most commonly characterized by a juxta-anastomotic stenosis, and at a histological level it is
characterized by a combination of aggressive neointimal hyperplasia at the juxta-anastomosis and an absence
of outward vascular remodeling. At present, there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of the
mechanisms and pathways that lead to AVF non-maturation. Thus, there are few, if any, effective therapies to
improve AVF non-maturation. The poor early outcomes following AVF creation and lack of therapies to treat
this clinical problem represent an unmet clinical need. Our long-term goal is to better understand the
pathobiology of AVF non-maturation in order to develop novel therapies. Preliminary work from our rodent AVF
model has shown impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (EDR) locally at the AVF early after creation.
Impairment in EDR represents reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)-derived nitric oxide (NO)
bioavailability. A decrease in NO bioavailability is associated with endothelial dysfunction. NOS3 and cGMP
regulation play key roles in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and vascular endothelial function. We
have identified histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1), through its dysregulation of NOS3 function, and cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as potential mediators of endothelial dysfunction following AVF creation.
Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine two important systems, HDAC1 and cGMP, that may play
key roles in influencing endothelial function during AVF development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
that dysregulation of NOS3 and cGMP activity during AVF development (exacerbated in the setting of chronic
kidney disease), results in loss of NO bioavailability, which impacts AVF remodeling and neointimal
hyperplasia development. We will test our central hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) To evaluate
mechanisms by which HDAC1 reduces NOS3 function and alters local endothelial function in the setting of
AVF development and (2)Â To determine the effects of inhibiting cGMP degradation on restoring local
endothelial function, and improving AVF remodeling and reducing neointimal hyperplasia development. We
believe our proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the understanding of the
pathobiology of AVF non-maturation. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve therapies for
AVF non-maturation. We expect that novel therapies to treat AVF non-maturation will positively impact
Veteran ESRD patients' health by improving morbidity and mortality, through reduction in tunneled
hemodialysis catheter use.

5R01AI116584-05,Regulation of T cell responses to allergens and environmental microbes,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The worldwide prevalence, morbidity and mortality of allergic asthma and associated cost are increasing. Moreover, asthma is the most common chronic disease reported in children, limiting the activities of many of then. In addition, allergi sensitization in childhood is a major predictor of chronic-relapsing asthma in adulthood. The pathophysiological features of chronic inflammation in allergic asthma are primarily the result of the aberrant activation and expansion of pathogenic T-helper 2 (TH2) immune responses to common environmental allergens. Thus, therapeutics that target the development, maintenance or function of allergen- specific TH2 cells could be used to treat asthma-associated pathology. Unfortunately, there are significant gaps in our understanding of mechanisms that initiate and regulate TH2 responses to inhaled allergens, which complicates the identification of therapeutic modalities that specifically block TH2 responses. Our preliminary data suggest that TH2 type-T follicular helper (TFH)-like cells represent TH2 memory precursors that persist long-term and convert into TH2 cell effector upon allergen recall responses. Moreover, our data suggest that the requirements to induce TH2 type-TFH-like/memory precursors vary with the age of the allergen sensitization and the levels of exposure to endotoxin. Finally, our data suggest that the age-related variances are, at least in part, mediated by differences in dendritic cell (DC) intrinsc response to toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation. Thus, we hypothesize that allergen sensitization induce DC-mediated priming of TH2-type TFH cells that full develop and survive as allergen-specific TH2-type memory cells for extended periods of time after interaction with B cells within the follicle. After allergen re-exposure, allergen-specific TH2-type TFH/memory cells differentiate into short-term effector-TH2 cells and home into the lung to cause pathology. Importantly, we hypothesize that the process of allergen sensitization is more efficient in childhood due to the fact that DCs differently respond to environmental endotoxin levels and induce enhanced priming of HDM-specific pre-TH2- type TFH cells and/or TH2-type TFH cells display an enhanced survival/maintenance in childhood. In this proposal we will test this model and evaluate how allergen-bearing DCs initiate TFH cell commitment and imprint a TH2-cytokine profile in adults and infants and how microbial exposure differentially affects this process. We will study the factors required for the long-term maintenance of allergen-specific TH2 type-TFH- like/memory cells and explore the plasticity of TH2-type TFH-like cell compartment. Finally, we will evaluate the potential clinical benefits of TFH-cell antagonist to deplete HDM-specific memory TFH cells and treat allergen- specific TH2 responses. We believe that our work will contribute to our understanding of how allergen TH2-type cell responses are initiated and maintained and ultimately reveal new information about potential targets for therapeutic intervention in patients with asthma.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease initiated and directed by T helper cells type 2 (TH2). The mechanism involved in generation of TH2 responses to inhaled allergens is largely unknown. This proposal will determine whether co-exposure to allergens and environmental endotoxin or other microbial products in childhood can influence development of long-lived memory type-2 T cells and therefore asthma severity in adults.,2019,367500,250000,117500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Asthma; Lung; Pediatric,Beatriz  Leon Ruiz

to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. IPF has a worse prognosis than most cancers: the five-year
mortality rate is 50-70%, and there are no curative medical therapies. The most significant risk factor for
developing IPF is a common, gain-of-function MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950, accounting for at least 30%
of the total risk. The MUC5B variant is also predictive of those with preclinical forms of pulmonary fibrosis (pre-
PF), which suggests that IPF risk variants may be helpful in identifying subjects with higher risk of disease
development. There could be a window of opportunity for targeted intervention, before significant loss of viable
lung parenchyma has occurred in at-risk individuals with preclinical stages of fibrotic disease.
Though MUC5B has been associated with IPF, the mechanistic role of MUC5B in IPF pathogenesis is unknown.
Our central hypothesis is that MUC5B abnormalities contribute to pathologic mucus and decreased mucociliary
clearance (MCC), which may help initiate and propagate fibrosis in IPF. Our objective is to elucidate the
mechanisms by which abnormal mucociliary physiology influence pulmonary fibrosis in (1) novel bleomycin-
induced pulmonary fibrosis ferret models and (2) human IPF patients stratified by rs35705950 genotype and
disease severity. These aims are in line with the mission of the NHLBI because they address important basic
and translational aspects for the interplay between mucociliary dysregulation and the development of pulmonary
fibrosis. As a result of the proposed studies, we expect to develop novel targets within the molecular regulation
of MUC5B expression or therapies to improve MCC such as mucolytics for intervention in the pre-PF to IPF
transition and in IPF patients, which could alter the disease course and improve both quality and duration of life.
This proposal will provide a solid training period for Jacelyn Peabody (PI) under the mentorship of Drs. Steven
Rowe (Sponsor) and Victor Thannickal (Co-sponsor) which will foster her career development as an astute and
creative physician-scientist. Successful completion will position her for an independent career investigating
disorders of mucociliary clearance and mechanisms of fibrosis using cutting-edge techniques.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease with increasing incidence
and prevalence that leads to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure. A promoter variant of MUC5B
confers the greatest risk, genetic or otherwise for developing this fatal disease that has no curative therapies;
nevertheless, the role of increased MUC5B expression in IPF pathogenesis remains unknown. This proposal
aims to determine whether MUC5B abnormalities and impaired mucociliary physiology impacts the development
and progression of pulmonary fibrosis in novel ferret models of disease pathogenesis and IPF patients.

5F31DK115169-03,Myeloid Expression of Heme Oxygenase-1 in the AKI to CKD Transition,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication for the critically ill and those undergoing cardiac surgery. Up
to 24% of cardiac surgery and more than 57% of intensive care unit patients suffer AKI. ICU-AKI patients have
a greatly increased odds of mortality (OR = 6.9 for stage 3 KDIGO Criteria). Additionally, patients who
experience AKI requiring dialysis are at a 28-fold increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Despite these facts, there are no targeted therapies available for AKI beside treating the underlying cause.
Oxidative stress-driven tubular cell death and acute inflammation, characterized by leukocytic infiltration, are
major components of AKI pathogenesis. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) degrades heme released from heme-
proteins from dying cells and is induced as a protective response to oxidative stress that occurs in AKI. We
previously demonstrated that the ability to induce HO-1 in myeloid cells is protective from damage,
inflammation, and fibrosis secondary to AKI in the acute phase. While much is known about inflammation in
AKI, the specific immune-mediated mechanisms that drive progressive kidney damage after AKI are
unknown. MF mediate interstitial kidney fibrosis as well as immune complex deposition. The MF cellular
origin (embryonic vs blood monocyte-derived) is an important determinant of function. Therefore, there is a
crucial need to understand the origin and lineage relationships of kidney macrophages and their intersection
with HO-1 expression in the AKI to CKD transition. Our central hypothesis is that deficiency of myeloid cell
expression of HO-1 following AKI worsens early inflammatory tissue damage and delays injury resolution and
tissue repair. Our objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which myeloid cell HO-1 regulates the AKI to
CKD transition. This is in line with the mission of the NIDDK, because it addresses important basic and
translational aspects of the highly prevalent and detrimental AKI to CKD transition. As a result of the proposed
studies, we expect to develop novel targets within the regulation of HO-1 expression or cell-based therapies for
intervention in the AKI to CKD transition.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Expanding our understanding of the genetic contributions and etiologies of birth defects and childhood cancer
will have a significant and direct impact on those affected by those conditions and contribute significantly to
research in related adult conditions. This proposal continues the HudsonAlpha-St. Jude Genome Sequencing
Center (HASJ-GSC) and expands its capabilities. The HASJ-GSC will provide an efficient and experienced
genomics resource to generate and analyze high-quality sequence and variant data from the largest number of
pediatric cancer and birth defect cohorts possible using the funds available over a three-year period. The
innovation, capabilities, and experience of the HASJ-GSC will produce data for the Gabriella Miller Kids First
Research Program that will be accessible and available to the research community and leveraged to its
maximal impact for years to come. A robust cost reduction plan allows for an increase in the number of cases
that can be sequenced and analyzed per dollar per year. The HASJ-GSC will generate exceptional quality
whole-genome sequence and variant data for all samples and for the pediatric cancer samples, RNASeq and
whole-exome data. The combined genome, exome and RNASeq will provide as much resolution as possible to
understand the genetic and functional genomic changes observed in pediatric cancer. The HASJ-GSC will also
provide support for a comprehensive collection of additional methodologies such as long read, lined-long read
and RNAseq. These will expand the resolution and type of investigation that can be supported for X01
investigators. The HASJ-GSC will also provide a reliable and efficient data storage and data access capability
that provides fast, reliable and efficient data access, sharing and reporting for the X01 projects and samples.
Finally, the HASJ-GSC will support efficient submission of sequence and variant data to the Gabriella Miller
Kids First Data Resource Center and help facilitate submission to the appropriate public databases.

5U01DK057008-20,03/16 Action for Health in Diabetes Extension Study Research Project,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 25% of the US population >65 years of age have type 2 diabetes and 80% of these individuals are overweight or obese. These individuals face shortened lifespans, increased health care needs, greater medical complications, and lower quality of life relative to those of similar age without these conditions. Lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss are recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but whether these interventions meaningfully improve the lives of older individuals with diabetes over extended follow-up is unknown. Look AHEAD is a randomized trial comparing the effects of intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity versus a control group given Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Although ILI did not produce beneficial effects on the primary and secondary outcomes related to cardiovascular disease, it did produce beneficial effects on a broad spectrum of health parameters during the period of the intervention. The LA Extension (LA-E) will examine whether ILI, provided for 10 years during mid- life, has enduring benefits that persist beyond the period of the intervention for older individuals with diabetes. We propose to follow approximately 3,800 participants (current ages 58-89 years) for 4.5 additional years with biennial clinic visits and 6-month outcomes phone calls. The primary aims of LA-E are to test whether ILI relative to DSE has long term legacy effects on 1) increased lifespan and 2) reduced health care costs. Secondary aims test whether ILI relative to DSE has long-term effects on key dimensions of healthy aging: less frailty, reduced diabetic microvascular complications, and improved quality of life. LA-E will also compare long- term trajectories of weight, physical activity, fat and lean mass, and bone density and examine how these are related to outcomes. LA-E focuses on the clinical outcomes that are most relevant to healthy aging and resilience and will provide the long-term data needed to frame guidelines related to lifestyle intervention in
the care of older overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Weight loss is recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, but the long-term effects of such approaches on the issues of greatest concern to older individuals --including mortality, health care utilization and costs, diabetic complications, quality of life, and frailty -- remain untested. The Look AHEAD-Extension will follow approximately 3800 of these individuals for an additional 4.5 years to determine whether random assignment to an intensive lifestyle intervention focused on weight loss achieved through healthy eating and increased physical activity relative to a control group leads to improved long-term health in later life. This extended follow-up will provide important information about the long-term beneficial effects of a lifestyle intervention in a growing segment

5U01AG018947-18,Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) Second Renewal - UAB Clinical Center,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic painful disorder that is the most frequent cause of mobility disability in older people. The MOST study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of this disease and factors that affect its course. Since the study began in 2003, it is increasingly recognized that by the time people develop chronic symptoms of knee OA, they usually have advanced structural findings of disease on MRI. Findings such as meniscal tears, malalignment and cartilage loss drive further structural deterioration and almost certainly limit prevention opportunities. We believe that prevention opportunities are likely to be greater if started in those who do not yet have severe continuous knee pain or advanced structural findings of disease. The functional impacts of knee OA occur in older people who experience multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities, and preventing disablement from OA requires a broader perspective than a focus on a single knee. For example, those with pain in one knee are at high risk of pain in other lower extremity musculoskeletal regions and, even if the knee is replaced, they may ultimately need treatment for pain in other joints developing as a consequence of the first joint affected. Also, in additionto functional loss, persons with OA experience buckling, falls and constraints in their involvement with the outside environment. We suggest there are opportunities to develop treatments and disease prevention strategies that have been unexplored and that by using new technologies and focusing on persons at a milder or earlier disease stage than previous studies, we can identify such opportunities. We propose to recruit a new mild disease cohort and continue to study the existing MOST cohort to identify new risk factors for disease and to study consequences of disease. Our goal is to find new strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knee osteoarthritis which causes chronic knee pain affects at least 12% of persons age 60 and over and is the most common cause of disability in elders, yet little is available to treat or prevent this disease.

5R21NS108508-02,Dopaminergic Modulation of Astrocytic Function in the Cerebellum,"ABSTRACT
Astrocytes are a key element of brain connectivity because they regulate neuronal communication at
synapses. Bergmann glial cells (BGCs), a major type of astrocytes in the cerebellum, are intimately associated
with excitatory glutamatergic synapses between Purkinje cell (PC) spines and parallel fibers or climbing fibers,
playing a significant role in synaptic stability and long-term plasticity. BGCs express a high density of Ca2+-
permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs), which are required for the maintenance of the BGC
processes that ensheath PC spine synapses. Genetic deletion of CP-AMPARs results in impaired associative
motor learning. Our preliminary data indicate that CP-AMPARs in BGCs are subject to dopaminergic (DAergic)
modulation. Pharmacological stimulation of D1 receptors enhances CP-AMPARs-mediated currents in BGCs,
and phosphorylates the GluA1 subunit at Ser845. Using transgenic mice with fluorescently-tagged D1
receptors and anterograde axonal tracing, we determined that D1 receptors are exclusively expressed in
BGCs, which receive DAergic afferents from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta in
the midbrain. Intriguingly, D1 receptor activation also increases PC firing and locomotor activity. Based on
these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that activation of D1 receptors induces insertion of CP-
AMPARs in BGCs, which in turn modulates PC synaptic function. To test this hypothesis, we will use a
combination of experimental approaches, including whole-cell recordings with optogenetic stimulation,
immunocytochemistry, molecular biology, and pharmacology. We propose two Specific Aims: (1) characterize
membrane insertion of GluA1 in Bergmann glial cells induced by DA; and (2) define the role of DAergic
modulation of Bergmann glial cells in PC activity. We expect to generate conceptually novel knowledge
regarding DA modulation of cerebellar circuitry function by defining the contribution of CP-AMPARs in BGCs to
synaptic function in PCs. These new findings will not only deepen our understanding of DAergic function in the
healthy brain, but also provide additional avenues for the development of disease-modifying therapies for
motor-related neurological disorders.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01DE028264-02,GÎ±13 signaling attenuates periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss in the mouse model of age-associated periodontitis,"The goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying how cell endogenous signaling regulates
chronic inflammation and bone loss in aging-associated periodontitis. Periodontitis is one of the most common
inflammatory diseases in humans that results in the destruction of periodontal tissues and alveolar bone which,
ultimately results in teeth loss, especially in aged population, and potentially manifests into systemic conditions.
Periodontal disease is inefficiently tackled by current therapeutics due to low response rates and adverse side
effects presenting a significant challenge in the aging population. However, the mechanism underlying the role of
GÎ±13 in inflammation diseases, including periodontal disease, especially under physiological aging and
pathological periodontitis, as well as the molecular mechanism by which GÎ±13 regulates periodontal
inflammation remains unknown. Current therapy is hindered by lack of understanding of the mechanisms
underlying how physiological changes result in an age-associated reduction of periodontal tissues tissue
functional capacity and contribute to increased incidence of periodontal disease. In our preliminary studies we
found that the expression of GÎ±13) significantly decreases as mice age increases, and we revealed that
Gna13f/fLysM-Cre mice exhibited severe bone loss with a significant increase in OC number, and PDL damage in
periodontal disease lesions. We also found exacerbated alveolar bone loss and PDL damage associated with
Gna13 deficiency in a periodontitis-induced model, while overexpression of local Gna13 constitutively active
form (Gna13CA) resulted in reduced periodontal bone loss and inflammation and repaired PDL. Based on
our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that GÎ±13 is a master negative regulator that inhibits
periodontitis-induced chronic inflammation and bone loss through GÎ±13/RhoA/AKT/IKK/NF-ÎºB pathway and the
increased GÎ±13 activate and signaling reduce the risk for age-associated periodontal disease. Three specific
aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will determine the function of GÎ±13 deficiency in
monocytes on exacerbating periodontal inflammation and cementum, periodontal ligament (PDL), and alveolar
bone loss by characterizing the phenotypes and pathomechanism of conditional knockout mouse models in
aging-associated periodontitis. In Aim 2, we will define the function of GÎ±13 in monocytes on attenuating
periodontal inflammation and periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone loss by characterizing the
phenotypes and pathomechanism of Gna13OE transgenic mouse models and AAV mediated GÎ±13 local
overexpression in aging-associated periodontitis. We will dissect the molecular mechanism by which GÎ±13
regulates periodontal inflammation and periodontal tissue and bone loss in age-associated periodontitis through
GÎ±13/RhoA/AKT/IKK/NF-ÎºB, and integrins signaling pathways. The proposed study will provide important
insights into the negative regulation of bone resorption and inflammation in aged-associated periodontitis by

excessive osteoclast (OC) differentiation implicated in many metabolic bone diseases. The immediate goal of
this application is to understand how OC differentiation is regulated through negative signaling mediated by
transcription factors and epigenetic regulators, which may serve as novel therapeutic targets for bone diseases
such as osteoporosis. Current therapies for osteolytic diseases are hindered by lack of understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of OC function to prevent bone loss. Moreover, the
mechanism(s) underlying how transcriptional factors and epigenetic factors co-regulate, especially negatively
co-regulate, OC differentiation and function remain unclear. We have identified Cbx3/HP1Î³. Our subsequent
immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that C/EBPÎ± interacts with Cbx3/HP1Î³ in OCs. Notably, our preliminary
data showed that Cbx3/HP1Î³ overexpression inhibited OC differentiation and activity, while Cbx3/HP1Î³ silencing
enhanced OC lineage commitment and formation. Consistently, Cbx3/HP1Î³-deficient mice were found to exhibit
osteoporosis-like phenotype due to enhanced OC formation and activity. Interestingly, through ChIP analysis, we
found several binding sites of Cbx3/HP1Î³ on the promoters of C/EBPÎ± regulated OC genes, NFATC1 and
C-FOS. Our RNA-seq analysis also revealed that Cbx3 deficiency in monocytes led to increased OC gene
expression. Collectively, the preliminary data indicated that Cbx3 can restrict C/EBPÎ±-mediated OC
differentiation and activity. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Cbx3 negatively regulates
osteoclast differentiation through interacting with C/EBPÎ± and epigenetic factors as a result of epigenetic
modification and preventing osteoclast gene expression in bone homeostasis. We will test the hypothesis
through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we examine the function of Cbx3 in OC differentiation, skeletal
development and bone homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions through characterization of
the phenotypes and pathomechanism in two Cbx3 CKO mouse models through loss-of-function studies. In Aim
2, we determine the role of Cbx3 in OC differentiation, skeletal development and bone homeostasis under
physiological and pathological conditions by characterizing the phenotypes and pathomechanism in Cbx3
conditional transgenic overexpression mice through gain-of-function approach. We define the molecular
mechanism underlying how Cbx3 negatively regulates OC differentiation through interacting with C/EBPÎ± and
controlling epigenetic modification in Aim 3. The study will elucidate the mechanism(s) through which Cbx3
cooperates with transcriptional factors and other epigenetic factors to negatively regulate OC differentiation and
activity. Insights gained from this study will not only address the basic scientific question about epigenetic
regulation of gene expression in OC biology, but also will provide the foundation for the ultimate goal of

2R01DE023813-06,Inhibiting inflammation and bone erosion in periodontal disease by targeting cell endogenous negative signaling,"The goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying how cell endogenous signaling regulates
chronic inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis. Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory
diseases in humans that results in the destruction of periodontal tissues and alveolar bone, which ultimately
lead to teeth loss. It is estimated that majority of adults over the age of 30 suffer from periodontal bone loss.
Also, growing evidence suggests that chronic periodontal inflammation is an important risk factor for several
pathological disorders including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis and arthritis. Hence, there is
an urgent need to develop novel and efficient therapeutic approaches to treat periodontal disease. Current
therapy is hindered by lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying how cell endogenous positive and
negative signaling changes result in the reduction of periodontal tissues functional capacity and contribute to
increased incidence of periodontal disease. In our preliminary studies, we found that GÎ±13f/fLysM-Cre mice
exhibited severe bone loss with a significant increase in OC number, and marked periodontal ligament (PDL)
damage in periodontal disease lesions. We also found overexpression of local GÎ±13 constitutively active form
(GÎ±13CA) resulted in reduced periodontal bone loss and inflammation and repaired PDL. Importantly, we
demonstrated that GÎ±13 deficiency promoted nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) activation through
downregulated RhoA and upregulated AKT activity, and that AAV-mediated GÎ±13 overexpression could
effectively reduce inflammation with decreased T cells and dendritic cells. Based on our preliminary studies,
we hypothesize that Endogenous negative regulators of macrophages, dendritic cells and osteoclasts
attenuates periodontitis-induced chronic inflammation and bone loss through the GÎ±13/RhoA/AKT/IKK/NF-ÎºB
pathway, and GÎ±13 signaling reduces the risk for periodontal disease. Three specific aims are proposed to test

Research Summary The etiology of most human diseases involves complicated interactions of multiple
environmental factors with individual genetic background which is initially generated early in human life, for
example, during the processes of embryogenesis and fetal development in utero. Maternal exposure to certain
diets with properties in influencing epigenetic processes may influence the epigenetic reprograming processes
during early embryogenesis, which may consequently influence gene expression patterns and eventually affect
phenotype outcome in the offspring such as differences in disease susceptibility. The bioactive dietary
components, sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate enriched in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli
sprouts (BSp), and genistein (GE) in soybean products are strong epigenetic modulators and robust
chemopreventive agents against various human diseases such as cancers and obesity-related diseases in
vitro and in vivo. We now have compelling evidence showing that maternal dietary BSp or GE treatments
influence offspring susceptibility to diseases and metabolic disorders such as breast cancer and
obesity in adult life. We hypothesize that BSp or GE bioactive natural plant products impact early embryonic
development by affecting epigenetic profiles resulting in different susceptibility to breast cancer and metabolic
disorders such as obesity later in life. The specific aims of this proposal are therefore to 1) determine the
temporal effects of early BSp or GE administration on development of breast cancer and obesity in mouse
models, 2) evaluate gene expression and epigenetic alterations of specific epigenetic-controlled genes in
response to early BSp or GE treatment and 3) assess the impacts of maternal BSp or GE diet on epigenomic
profiles including methylome and acetylome alterations as well as determination of key candidate epigenetic
genes in control of early disease chemoprevention by this regimen. The goal of this proposal is to determine
the effectiveness of maternal BSp and GE diets on early-life disease intervention and the potential epigenetic
mechanisms. This study may lead to translational disease chemoprevention potential that benefits human
health by appropriate administration of prenatal and/or postnatal dietary supplements leading to early
prevention of multiple human diseases including breast cancer, obesity and obesity-related human diseases.
The Candidate anticipates being able to complete the studies within a five-year award period through
collaborative efforts with her Mentors and collaborators.","Public Health Relevance Statement

5F31NS105458-02,Consequences of metabolic reprogramming by GLUT3 in GBM,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV astrocytoma; GBM) is the most common and deadly primary malignant brain
tumor in adults. Therapy development has been hampered by the heterogeneous nature of GBM. Within
GBM, a subset of tumor cells known as brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) are highly tumorigenic and have
some properties of neural stem cells. By co-opting the high affinity neuronal glucose transporter type 3
(GLUT3) brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) can preferentially survive in low nutrient tumor microenvironments;
leading to tumor promotion and progression. GLUT3 expression in many solid tumor types such as GBM, colon
cancer, head and neck cancers and ovarian cancer is correlated with poor prognosis and survival. High GLUT3
expression also correlates with metastatic or invasive disease. The relationship between GLUT3 expression
and invasion in GBM has not been explored. In this study, we aim to understand the role of metabolic
reprogramming by GLUT3 in the invasion of GBM and explore opportunities for the pharmacological targeting
of GLUT3 . We have identified novel GLUT3 inhibitors that are able to preferentially inhibit the growth and
glucose up take of BTICs with little toxicity to non-neoplastic cells. Through this study, we hope to understand
the role of GLUT3 in tumors and to identify a potential new therapeutic option to target metabolic
reprogramming for the treatment of GBM.","PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE
Metabolic reprogramming is an emerging hallmark of cancer. We have determined that glucose transporter 3
plays a main role in the metabolism of glioblastoma derived brain tumor initiating cells. Understanding the
consequences of and targeting GLUT3 shows promise for improving the treatment of glioblastoma.",2019,28225,28225,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases,Catherine J Libby
3R01HL136432-03S1,Role of FAK in vascular inflammation,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that arises due to a combination of various stimuli, such as
cytokines and disturbed blood flow. These stimuli result in pro-inflammatory cell adhesion molecule expression,
an early event in atherogenesis, which recruit leukocytes to the activated endothelium, leading to a chronic
inflammatory state. Although the use of preventative pharmacological approaches for these conventional risks,
such as lipid lowering and antihypertensive drugs, have been beneficial, there is no treatment available to
reduce these early steps of atherogenesis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an integrin-associated protein
tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in maintaining normal vascular physiology upon changes in both
cytokine and blood flow signaling. Our preliminary findings have revealed that FAK inhibition in endothelial cells
(EC) prevented tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±)-induced expression of various pro-inflammatory molecules,
suggesting a potential â€œant-inflammatory roleâ€ for FAK inhibition. Interestingly, in ApoE-/- model, FAK inhibitor
was able to block vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression and reduced macrophage
recruitment, implicating FAK as a potential target for atherosclerosis. While NF-ÎºB is normally inhibited by IÎºBÎ±,
inflammatory stimuli lead to rapid IÎºBÎ± degradation and NF-ÎºB activation. IÎºBÎ± is then upregulated by NF-ÎºB
activity, thus inhibiting NF-ÎºB. In atherosclerosis, however, sustained NF-ÎºB activation occurs due to continued
inflammatory stimuli, which leads to oscillations of NF-ÎºB activity as IÎºBÎ± is continually made and degraded. We
discovered that FAK inhibition in ECs prevented sustained NF-ÎºB activation due to increased stability of IÎºBÎ±,
sequestering NF-ÎºB in cytoplasm inactive. Further, we found that this long term IÎºBÎ± stabilization by FAK
inhibition may be mediated by reduced FAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ± kinase (IKK). Taken
together, our data suggest that FAK activity drives TNF-Î±-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression through
sustained NF-ÎºB oscillations. Surprisingly, FAK inhibitor blocks plaque formation in ApoE -/- model of disturbed
flow, indicating a potential role of FAK activity in flow signaling. Taken together, our central hypothesis is that
FAK inhibition may prevent atherosclerosis by blocking stimuli-induced pro-inflammatory molecule expression
via dampened NF-ÎºB oscillations. In aim-1, we will determine the molecular mechanism of FAK action in
maintaining sustained NF-ÎºB signaling upon TNF-Î± and disturbed blood flow in ECs. In aim-2, we will evaluate
if FAK-mediated NF-ÎºB activity in ECs has therapeutic potential by using pharmacological and genetic FAK
atherosclerosis mouse models. This study will produce new insights into atherogenesis via FAK-mediated
NF-ÎºB activity in ECs. Furthermore, FAK inhibitor's ability to block sustained NF-ÎºB activity and plaque
formation might provide a new therapeutic option in the treatment vascular inflammatory diseases.","Atherosclerosis is caused by chronic vascular inflammation, in which sustained NF-kB activity plays a major

Nita Limdi, Pharm.D, PhD has built a successful research program focused on antithrombotic therapy
pharmacogenomics encompassing both observational and clinical trial designs. Her scientific career goals
are to comprehensively understand the clinical, environmental and genetic factors that influence variability
in antithrombotic response and to use this information to personalize antithrombotic treatment, especially in
patients with multiple comorbidities. The proposed award would enable her to continue mentoring while
augmenting her research, specifically incorporating aims built to address key knowledge gaps regarding the
oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.
The new research proposed herein is builds on ongoing work to create unique and much needed patient
oriented research (POR) training opportunities within the evolving landscape of oral antithrombotic therapy
and integrates pharmacogenomics and implementation of precision medicine. The candidate's NHLBI R01
grant along with the three new projects will form the basis for the mentee training. Each project is led by a
mentee. PROJECT1 will elucidate the influence of heart failure as defined as left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF <40%) on warfarin response. PROJECT 2: will evaluate the influence of clinical and genetic
(candidate genes) on Dabigatran (DBG) related hemorrhage and build clinical prediction rules to
personalize the prediction of hemorrhage among DBG users. PROJECT 3: will evaluate the effectiveness of
genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy (GGAT) on complications following percutaneous coronary
intervention and assess its clinical utility and economic value.
Mentorship aims expanding the POR training opportunities for MD, Pharm.D, and PhD trainees. Mentees
will lead the new projects, conduct analysis and publish original research. They will leverage this to propose
new research as part of their NIH- K23 applications.
In the strongly supportive and collaborative environment of UAB, this award will ensure Dr. Limdi continues
to grow her research program, and build capacity in POR by mentoring junior investigators to build their own
careers. The breadth and depth of the multiple institutional programs, UAB's CTSA and her leadership in
UAB's Personalized Medicine Institute will provide the resources and the foundation to advance precision
cardiovascular medicine.","Clinical, genetic and environmental factors that predict individual variability in antithrombotic response can help

5P30DK074038-15,The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Disease Core Center Pilot and Feasibility Program,"ABSTRACT
The Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease Core Center (HRFDCC) has a robust Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program
that provides one to two years of support for outstanding and innovative research proposals related to
hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (HRFDs), with an emphasis on ARPKD. The mission of the HRFDCC P&F
Program is: 1) to attract and support the development of junior scientists interested in HRFD-related research;
2) to enable established investigators from other fields to explore the feasibility of innovative concepts in
HRFD; and 3) to entice investigators with existing expertise in the Center's thematic areas to apply their
expertise to HRFD-related questions. The Center has been very successful in accomplishing all of these goals
and has supported 16 projects over the past nine years. This included support for many physician-scientists
and nine investigators that were new to the HRFD field. In agreement with the intent of the Center to serve a
national research base and to develop junior faculty, most of the awardees were from outside the HRFDCC
institutions (UAB/MUSC/CN) and were at the Assistant Professor rank. Our P&F awardees have been
remarkably successful with 35 peer reviewed publications and $10.4 million (from $1.13 million investment in
P&F awards) in follow-up direct support related to their P&F awards. Importantly, all but two of the P&F
awardees remain active in HRFD research. Major added value of the HRFDCC P&F Program are the
collaborative environment established with the UAB/UCSD O'Brien Center, the UAB Nephrology Research and
Training Center (NRTC), the CTSA programs at UAB, MUSC, and CN, and the continued leverage of
institutional resources to increase investment and training opportunities for the Pilot Program recipients. These
joint efforts will allow support for a third P&F award utilizing institutional resources to the HRFDCC and the
NRTC for a UAB investigator with a highly meritorious application focused on one of the Center's themes. In
addition, the HRFDCC P&F Program is partnering with other P30 PKD Centers for joint mentorship, training,
and professional development activities, to develop a national awards program, and for expanded access to
resources and important services that will further increase P&F awardee success outcomes. Finally, the P&F
Program will offer Vouchers to junior investigators with meritorious projects that did not quite rise to the level of
funding in our P&F program (or through other funding agencies) for Core usage to facilitate novel resource or
assay development or for preliminary data generation needed for successful grant resubmission. This will also
enhance interactions between the Investigator Base and our Cores and promote innovative advances through
generation of new models and establishment of new services that will benefit the whole HRFD research field.

5R35HL135830-03,Program on cellular metabolism and lung fibrosis,"Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a clinically refractory disease with a life expectancy of 2-6 years after
diagnosis. Despite decades of extensive research, effective treatments for IPF are disappointingly limited.
There is a pressing need for discovering novel therapeutic strategies based on better understanding of the
disease pathogenesis. This program is based on my prior work and vision that lung fibrosis is characterized by
perturbations of distinct core metabolic programs in different types of pulmonary cells, a potentially paradigm-
shifting concept that has just begun to be appreciated. Delineation of how core metabolic pathways are
specifically regulated, particularly at the epigenetic level by specific miRNAs, in different pulmonary cell types,
how they contribute to the pro-fibrotic phenotypic alterations of the affected cells, and how metabolic
intermediators act in intercellular communication to promoter pulmonary cell dysfunction will significantly
advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. In this program, we will use genetic, epigenetic
and pharmacological approaches to fine-tune dysregulated core metabolic program in the lung to gain novel
insight into the contributions of core metabolic abnormalities to lung fibrosis pathogenesis and to determine the
best strategies to fix these metabolic aberrations for treating this disease. I believe that my program will lay a
solid foundation for designing potentially ground-braking metabolic approaches to effective lung fibrosis
therapies. My program will also shed new light into disease mechanism of many other mechanistically related
pulmonary disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension and COPD.","Project Narrative Description
The program is built around my vision that pulmonary metabolic dysregulation has an important role in the
pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. The studies proposed in this program should not only improve understanding of
the participation of metabolic abnormalities of different types of pulmonary cells in progression of lung fibrosis,
but also are likely to provide solid groundwork for translating metabolic approaches into effective lung fibrosis
therapies.",2019,742500,500000,242500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R35,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases,Gang  Liu
1R01EY030470-01,Automated Orientation & Mobility Training in Virtual Reality for Low Vision Rehabilitation,"The long-term objective of the research is to use Virtual Reality-based Intelligent Orientation & Mobility
Specialists (VR-IOMSs) to teach a large portion of the orientation & mobility (O&M) curriculum to low vision
(LV) patients. O&M, the ability to orient oneself and to travel independently, safely and efficiently in any
environment, is the foundation of independent living and high quality of life. O&M rehabilitation is the only
proven intervention that restores mobility lost to LV. Current O&M rehabilitation is conducted by certified O&M
specialists (COMS) in real streets. The shortage and uneven distribution of COMS, the mobility difficulty of LV
patients, the long training needed to regain independent travel, the non-reimbursable cost of COMS time and
the low income/unemployment status of the LV population make this valuable service inaccessible and
unaffordable to many who need it the most. A VR-IOMS, a computer program, combines virtual reality and
intelligent tutoring technologies. When VR-IOMS courses are delivered through the internet, LV patients can
receive quality O&M training in safe virtual environments at their convenient location and time with little cost.
This new intervention can thus reduce the accessibility and affordability barriers to O&M rehabilitation.
The proposed research is built on our previous study of teaching O&M skills in virtual streets. It is designed to
test the hypothesis that there is no difference in real street O&M performance between LV patients who receive
O&M training from VR-IOMSs and those who receive training from human COMSs in real streets. Three
specific aims will be achieved. 1) Design VR-IOMSs. Three VR-IOMSs for three important O&M tasks, timing
to cross a signalized street, timing to cross an uncontrolled street and learning the outdoor numbering system,
will be designed. This involves collecting expert knowledge about teaching these tasks through focus group
research, defining intelligent course flow and designing course contents in virtual reality. 2) Implement the VR-
IOMSs. This involves building virtual reality simulators, developing virtual street scenarios, authoring the
intelligent course, programming interfaces between the intelligent O&M specialists and virtual street scenarios.
3) Validate the VR-IOMSs. A randomized training trial will be conducted to compare VR-IOMS and human
COMS O&M training. LV subjects will be randomized to learning the three O&M tasks from the VR-IOMSs,
from human COMSs and no training. All subjects will be taken to real streets by COMSs before and after
training to evaluate their O&M task performance. Pre- and post-training performance changes of the three
groups will be compared to quantify relative training effectiveness. If these VR-IOMSs are proven effective,
more will be developed and validated in future research. Clinical deployment of these training agents will
restore independent travel to more LV patients. The VR-IOMSs, with their explicitly defined training strategies,
objective assessments of learner behavior and quantitative outcome measures, can serve as platforms to
advance O&M research. Experience gained here can be used to improve other fields of rehabilitation.","Project Narrative

5P01HL114470-07,Animal Core,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a most enigmatic fatal lung disorder. Although significant progress
has been made in our understanding of IPF pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathophysiology of IPF remain poorly understood. Moreover, although two anti-fibrosis drugs, pirfenidone and
nintedanib, have been approved by FDA for the treatment of IPF, the efficacy of these drugs for the later stages
of the disease is uncertain and neither drug reduces IPF mortality (1-4). Based on the results from the Cycle I
of this Translational Program Project (tPPG), we will, in this renewal tPPG, test a hypothesis that redox-metabolic
control of myofibroblast activation, modulated by innate/adaptive immune mechanisms (alveolar macrophages
and B-cells), leads to progressive fibrosis. Specifically, we will test the safety and efficacy of a small molecule
inhibitor of NOX1/4 in a Phase IIb clinical trial (Project 1; Duncan, Project Leader) and explore the mechanisms
by which NOX4 regulates pro-fibrotic metabolic programs in myo-Fbs (Project 2; Thannickal, Project Leader).
Based on new convincing data, we will also investigate the role of NOX4 in regulating cellular metabolism and
pro-fibrotic phenotypes of alveolar macrophages (Project 3; Carter, Project Leader) and the role of auto-Abs (B-
cells) in regulating epigenetic control of pro-fibrotic genes in activated myo-Fbs (Project 4; Sanders, Project
Leader). To aid in testing the hypothesis and developing the therapeutic drugs for IPF, the overall objective of
the Animal Core is to provide centralized and standardized procedures for the animal studies proposed in
Projects 2, 3, and 4. Specifically, the Core will provide two of the most commonly used murine lung fibrosis
models, bleomycin-induced and asbestos-induced lung fibrosis models, for Project 2, 3, and 4 to test the
therapeutic potential of GKT137831 for lung fibrosis and the underlying mechanism. The core will also provide
standardized service for drug (GKT137931) delivery through oral gavage. Moreover, the Core will provide
standardized technique service for the measurement of lung injury and fibrosis by micro CT image and mouse
lung function by FlexiVent. Centralization and standardization of the procedures will lead to high quality,
reproducible, and comparable results among individual projects, which are essential for the success of this tPPG.","Based on the results from the Cycle I of this Translational Program Project (tPPG), this renewal tPPG will explore

Background: Triple-negative (estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor [PR]/human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer.
Approximately 34% of patients with TNBC will experience distant recurrence within 3 years and eventually
develop chemotherapy-resistant, incurable disease. Therefore, development of novel treatments is necessary.
Accumulating data demonstrate that microRNA (miR)-146a, which is part of the miR-146 family, inhibits cancer
cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in human cancers, including TNBC, suggesting that miR-146a
functions as a tumor suppressor in tumor cells. Previously, our group demonstrated that miR-146a negatively
regulates NF-ÎºB activation to inhibit tumor growth in TNBC. Furthermore, our data suggested that miR-146a
suppresses TNBC colonization through the cellular transfer of miR-146a by exosomes at distant sites and the
delivery of miR-146a mimic influences the cells at metastatic sites in vivo. Thus, miR-146a may have potential
to block TNBC cell colonization at distant sites. We now seek to test the therapeutic value of miR-146a in the
prevention or treatment of TNBC metastasis.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that miR-146a effectively blocks the tumor colonization of disseminated TNBC
cells at metastatic sites. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) To evaluate the therapeutic value
of miR-146a in blocking tumor colonization at metastatic sites, and 2) To determine the mechanism of miR-146a-
mediated suppression of tumor metastasis.
Approach: First, to address the impact of miR-146a on preventing human TNBC cell colonization, we will
intravenously inject scramble miR or miR-146a mimic nanoparticles once circulating tumor cells are detected in
xenograft mouse models. Next, to evaluate the efficacy of miR-146a in inhibiting tumor metastasis in a clinically
relevant model, we will intravenously inject scramble miR or miR-146a mimic nanoparticles into TNBC patient-
derived xenograft mouse models and determine if miR-146a blocks TNBC metastasis to distant organs. Finally,
to identify which cells are influenced by miR-146a and which miR-146a-regulated pathways are involved in tumor
metastasis, we will use our innovative transgenic mouse model that expresses a miR-146a-targeted GFP
reporter to monitor miR-146a activity in specific cell types during tumor metastasis.
Innovation and Significance: TNBC remains a highly aggressive and fatal subtype of breast cancer, with the
highest mortality in young minority women. Developing effective therapies to treat this disease is crucial. The
data from this study will not only provide a novel therapeutic approach to block tumor metastasis in TNBC, but
will also identify a new molecular mechanism responsible for tumor metastasis. Since our preliminary studies
support the suppressive role of miR-146a in tumor metastasis, the tight focus of this project will allow us to
establish the mechanism-driven innovative pre-clinical studies that could lead to a first-in-human clinical trial.","Project Narrative

5R01DK113980-02,CKD Risk Prediction among Obese Living Kidney Donors,"SUMMARY
Living kidney donors continue to be a critical source of organs facilitating timely transplantation and excellent
outcomes. Historically, living donors were healthy and free of baseline abnormalities. In response to the organ
shortage, transplant centers now commonly approve donors classified as obese (body mass index (BMI) â‰¥
30kg/m2), and currently, more than 25% of all living donors are considered obese at donation. Relaxation of
selection criteria to include obese living donors has occurred despite a paucity of safety data. Determining
candidacy for living donation among obese individuals remains challenging, as the appropriate BMI cutoff
above which donation is no longer safe is unknown. Most centers have implemented a â€œone size fits allâ€
approach to setting BMI limits (e.g. individuals with BMI > 35kg/m2 are excluded from donation) rather than a
personalized approach that accounts for individual baseline differences. In the general population, obese
individuals have a 3.57-fold higher risk for ESRD compared to individuals with normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9
kg/m2). Donors are not drawn from the general population, but are very carefully screened, and the impact of
obesity might be different in these healthier individuals. In a recent multi-cohort study of individuals healthy
enough to be potential donors (healthy non-donors), the adjusted risk for ESRD associated with obesity was
only 1.16-fold higher but varied significantly based on other baseline comorbidities. The true risk among obese
living donors likely falls somewhere in between these estimates: obese living donors are otherwise healthy at
baseline but lose half their nephron mass. Our preliminary findings suggest that risk for post-donation ESRD is
significantly higher among obese compared with non-obese donors. However, it remains unclear if this risk is
modified by other baseline comorbidities or obesity-related characteristics (e.g. BMI trajectory, metabolic
syndrome), reflective of underlying differences between obese and non-obese persons, or directly attributable
to donation itself. We hypothesize that the impact of obesity on post-donation ESRD risk varies significantly by
obesity-related characteristics and other comorbidities, and an obese phenotype exists in whom living kidney
donation is safe. To better understand the relationship between obesity and risk for post-donation kidney
failure, we will leverage and build upon an existing NIH-funded retrospective cohort study of live donors to
assemble the largest cohort of obese living donors and will: (1) explore the association of baseline health
characteristics with risk for post-donation kidney failure among obese living kidney donors; (2) explore the
association of obesity-specific risk factors with risk for post-donation kidney failure; (3) develop a tool for kidney
failure risk among obese living donors; (4) estimate risk for post-donation kidney failure among obese living
donors directly attributable to donation. Our findings will have a major impact on the practice of living donation
among obese persons, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care.","NARRATIVE

5K23DK103918-05,Long-term outcomes among living kidney donors with isolated medical abnormalities,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for kidney transplantation continues to exceed the supply. Increasing the number of living kidney donors is a major priority. Historically,
living donors were healthy and free of isolated medical abnormalities (IMA) at the time of donation. Recently, general US population demographics have changed, and in response, transplant centers now include donors with IMAs such as pre-hypertension (pre-HTN), obesity, and metabolic syndrome. At a general population level, individuals with IMAs, particularly African Americans (AA), are more likely to develop comorbidities, such as diabetes, HTN, and chronic kidney disease. Recent data suggest that AA living kidney donors are more likely to have a pre-donation IMA. It remains unclear what impact, if any, living donation will have on development of these comorbidities, and whether racial disparities in risk attributable to donation exist. Current methods for assessing living donor long-term health risks are imprecise, relying heavily on traditional factors such as family and social histories. Morphometric measures (e.g. vascular calcifications; fat distribution), using radiologic imaging, have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular risk. Pre-donation imaging, routinely acquired during donor evaluations to assess renal anatomy, can be leveraged to identify novel morphometric risk predictors for post-donation comorbidities. I hypothesize that morphometric measures will greatly improve prediction of post-donation comorbidities, including risk directly attributable to donation. Given significant knowledge gaps in risk prediction and stratification of donors with IMAs, I propose an ancillary study that will leverage data from an ongoing R01-funded cohort study of live donors to create the largest cohort of IMA donors studied and will address unique aims: (1) explore the association of novel morphometric measures and traditional risk factors with post-donation comorbidity stratified by race; (2) develop a risk tool for predicting post-donation comorbidities; and (3) estimate risk attributable to living kidney donation. Utilization o novel morphometric measures obtained from routine pre- donation imaging is innovative, highly practical, and will create a level of risk prediction of living donor outcomes that currently does not exist. Precise risk prediction will improve informed consent, donor autonomy in medical decision making, and will change the practice of live kidney donor selection in the US. Resources and infrastructure at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, including the most AA living kidney donors in the US, are keenly in-line with the proposed aims, and will provide the necessary foundation to see the proposed project to its successful completion. The mentored award will foster my growth as an independent investigator by affording me opportunities to focus on building an expertise in novel risk prediction research and enhancing my exposure to health disparities and chronic disease epidemiology in minority populations. This additional training will inform my path toward long-term career goals of research independence as a surgeon-scientist and R01 funding.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As the demand for kidneys continues to exceed the supply, transplant centers have begun to relax selection criteria to include living donors with obesity and/or high blood pressure.

5F30HL136195-03,"Protein o,o'-Dityrosine Cross-linking in Lung Injury and Wound Healing","PROJECT SUMMARY
 This F30 application is for support of Morgan Locy's MD/PhD training. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a
chronic, progressive lung disorder that results in loss of functional alveolar-capillary units leading to impaired
gas exchange and respiratory failure. The number of individuals with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in the
United States is estimated at 500,000 with increasing incidence and prevalence. About 40% of diagnoses of
ILD are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with this population having particularly high mortality and morbidity
with a five-year mortality rate of 50-70%. IPF is a disease of aging with features of aberrant wound healing.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in IPF pathogenesis, and â€œsignaturesâ€ of chronic oxidative damage
observed in lung tissue from IPF patients. Our lab has shown that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) producing enzyme, is upregulated in the lung of IPF patients; the pro-fibrotic cytokine,
transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), upregulates NOX4-dependent H2O2 production. We recently reported
that o,o'-dityrosine levels, a covalent tyrosine modification catalyzed by H2O2 and a heme peroxidase (hPx),
are increased in proteins within the circulating plasma of ILD patients. This increase in plasma levels of this
oxidative biomarker was also replicated in a murine model of lung injury and fibrosis. The identity of the hPx or
the enzymatic source of H2O2 in the context of ILD and experimental lung fibrosis is not known. Mechanisms of
the formation of protein-associated o,o'-dityrosine and how it contributes to disease pathogenesis is also
unknown. I have observed that the ECM protein, fibronectin (FN), undergoes o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking. FN
is known to play a central role in physiologic and pathologic wound healing. Further understanding the
modulation of FN by o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking could provide novel insights into normal wound healing and
the dysregulation that occurs in pathologic states of aberrant wound healing. The central hypothesis for these
studies is that the hPx, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and NOX4-dependent H2O2 generate o,o'-dityrosine in an in
vivo lung injury model; additionally, FN o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking alters its function/stability in in vitro cell
models. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the mediators of o,o'-dityrosine formation and its
effect on physiologic and pathologic wound healing in the lung. This understanding will guide strategies for the
development of novel therapeutics in the setting of aberrant wound healing seen in ILD.
 This proposal will provide a solid training platform for Morgan Locy (PI) under the mentorship of Dr. Victor
Thannickal (sponsor) that will foster his career development as an astute and creative physician-scientist.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01HD095248-02,Promoting Transportation Safety in Adolescence,"Project Summary / Abstract
The application will address the leading cause of death for adolescents, motor vehicle crashes. In 2010, there
were more than 887,000 police reported motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) involving teen drivers resulting in
2,387,139 people involved in MVCs with a teen behind-the-wheel. Teen drivers account for a disproportionate
number of fatal and nonfatal injuries from motor vehicle crashes. Evidence is emerging that comprehensive
parenting programs and on-road driver assessment and feedback can optimize the learner's permit period and
possibly reduce crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to identify effective programs that can reduce
adolescents' risk for motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). The current best-practice policy approach to teen driver
MVC prevention are state-level Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) programs; however, GDL's success has
come from its focus on restricting access to high risk contexts and not on directly improving novice adolescent
drivers' competence. While additional public health benefit can be obtained by directly addressing this issue,
existing training programs and models have not been successful. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for
novel efficacious interventions that target young drivers' inexperience directly to complement the strong and
policy-level structure put in place by GDL. The current application addresses this need. In the proposed study
we will evaluate a comprehensive program that consists of both parent- and teen-directed components. For
teens, there is a state-of-the art on-road driver assessment (ODA). The ODA is completed by a certified driving
rehabilitation specialist (CDRS) who provides tailored feedback on the teens' performance and verbally
reinforces use of the parent intervention components. For parents, there are face-to-face parent sessions with
a trained facilitator and learning-to-drive handbook. These are designed to improve parent engagement across
a wide range of parenting behaviors related to the learner and intermediate periods of GDL. This
comprehensive parent-teen intervention (PTI) improves on existing programs by jointly targeting both parents
and teens and utilizes data from R03HD082664 that indicates the ODA reduces crash risk by an estimated
53%. We propose a randomized controlled trial with 1,200 parent-teen dyads to evaluate our central
hypothesis, which is that the comprehensive parent- and teen-directed intervention administered during the
learner period of GDL can reduce the proportion of adolescent drivers who are in a motor vehicle crash (MVC)
during the first 12 months of licensure compared to a usual practice control condition.","Project Narrative

Project Summary
The immune system plays a critical role in protecting us from infection and resolving or repairing tissue injury
following infection or other environmental insults that cause damage. The immune system is also a major
contributor to chronic inflammatory diseases that drive health care costs and morbidity and mortality in the
U.S., including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmunity, asthma, transplant rejection and many others.
Over the last three decades we have learned much about how immune cells develop and mature, how immune
cells are activated and differentiate into â€œeffectorâ€ cells, how immune cell memory is initiated and maintained
and how immune cells contribute in a functional way to immune-mediated protection and damage. In this U19
Program, we are particularly interested in B lineage cells that contribute to immune function by presenting
antigen and activating CD4 T cells, by altering the immune microenvironment through the production of
cytokines and chemokines and, most importantly, by differentiating into short- and long-lived antibody
producing plasma cells (ASCs) and long-lived memory B cells. These cells are responsible for the humoral arm
of the adaptive immune system and are key to host defense against most viral and bacterial pathogens.
However, antibodies produced by ASCs are also responsible for much of the tissue damage associated with
autoimmunity, asthma and transplantation. Many of our insights into the protective and pathologic functions of
B lymphocytes and ASCs have come from genetically modified mouse model studies and, although these
studies have been very informative, it is clear that mice and humans are not identical and that there is a need
to better understand how human B cells contribute to immune (dys)function. Our studies of human B cells are
still quite rudimentary â€“ largely because the studies have been limited to the easily accessible circulating blood
compartment. This is the equivalent of studying the tail of the elephant without seeing the whole elephant â€“ we
miss most of the complexity and heterogeneity of B cells when we only examine a tiny fraction of the cells that
are present in the body. In this U19, we plan to move beyond the elephant tail as our goal is to
comprehensively examine the molecular, cellular and functional properties of human B cells that reside
specifically in the less accessible human tissues and organs. The major objective of Core A is to provide
oversight and support for the overall Program and the individual projects and cores. We will meet this objective
by: (i) providing all projects and cores with scientific, administrative, regulatory and financial oversight; and (ii)
organizing scientific interactions, including the monthly research in progress meetings for the Program
scientists, the annual retreat with the scientific advisory board, the annual meeting with other Cooperative
Centers on Human Immunology groups and the Human Immunology themed session at the Southeastern
Immunology Symposium.

1U19AI142737-01,Tissue and organ specific human B cell immunity,"Overall: Tissue and organ-specific human B cell immunity
Project Summary
Experiments conducted using genetically modified mice and model pathogens or antigens have shaped our
current understanding of adaptive immunity. From these studies, it is clear that both B and T cell immunity is
exquisitely tailored to the pathogen or antigen. Furthermore, the data show that adaptive immune responses in
lymphoid and peripheral tissues, which are found in both mucosal and systemic sites, can differ dramatically.
Thus, we now know that studying immunity in a single lymphoid tissue to model antigens, while informative, does
not reveal the full complexity of the adaptive immune response. This lesson, learned using mouse models, can
also be applied to human immune responses. To date, the vast majority of human immune responses have only
been queried in the blood. This approach has not only limited our analysis to the lymphocytes that are in
circulation but has also restricted us to examining a small fraction of the cells (typically 1-2%) that are in
circulation at a given time. This â€œlimited sampling approachâ€ has also impaired our capacity to examine antigen-
specific lymphocytes as these cells are rare populations, even during an ongoing immune response, and are
largely undetectable under homeostatic conditions. Thus, we know exceedingly little about the phenotype,
molecular programming, lifespan and function of human immune cells that reside primarily in tissues under
homeostatic conditions. Moreover, we know essentially nothing about the clonal connections between antigen-
specific cells in the different tissues of the human body. These represent fundamental gaps in our basic
knowledge of the human immune system and reduce our ability to design new vaccines to prevent emerging
infections, to create immunotherapies that can be used to treat cancer, autoimmunity and chronic disease and
to develop tolerance-inducing regimens that will improve transplantation outcomes. Therefore, the overall goal
of this U19 Program is to determine the molecular and functional relationships between human memory B
lymphocyte and antibody secreting cell (ASC) populations that are found in pulmonary, intestinal and adipose
tissues under homeostatic conditions. This U19 Program, which is composed of three Projects and three
scientific Cores, will test our central hypothesis that antigen-specific, antigen-experienced human tissue-residing
B cells are heterogeneous with respect to phenotype, transcriptome, breadth of reactivity, and function. We
expect our studies to reveal the identity of novel subsets of antigen-experienced B cells exhibiting unique tissue-
specific â€œsignaturesâ€. This outcome will inform future studies of fundamental basic human immunobiology and is
likely to influence future translational and clinical studies, as B cells specific for the viral antigens and bacterial
cell wall components are important targets for vaccination and are required for host defense against a number
of different Biodefense Category A and C pathogens.","Overall: Tissue and organ specific human B cell immunity

The NIH Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology (CCHI) program was designed to promote research in
human immunology by providing funding for 8-10 Programs as well as additional financial support for pilot
projects, new resource and reagent development and/or cross-program collaborative efforts. These
developmental awards are made possible through funding provided by the Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund
(IOF) grant. The Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund grant is awarded to one of the Programs supported
through the CCHI U19 mechanism. The institution that receives the Infrastructure and Opportunity Funds grant
is responsible for establishing an Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund Management Core (IOFMC). The
IOFMC works with the NIH Program officers and the CCHI scientific steering committee to solicit, review and
distribute Infrastructure and Opportunity Funds as subawards to researchers at the IOFMC parent institution
and investigators working at other institutions, who are, in many cases, members of one of the other funded
CCHI cooperative centers. The IOFMC is responsible for administrative oversight of the subawards and for
ensuring that the recipient of the award and the institution in which they work are in compliance with all
applicable state, NIH and federal regulations and that charges to the subaward are reasonable and allowable.
Finally, the IOFMC must also provide annual financial reports on the awarded subcontracts to NIH. The major
goal of the UAB IOFMC will be to establish an administrative structure that will manage the subaward program
from the request for applications (RFA) stage, to the pre- and post-award process, and through the grant close-
out and reporting phase. In order to meet this goal, we will: (i) coordinate the IOF project application and
selection process; (ii) establish subcontracts to distribute IOF development and pilot project grants to Project
Leaders at other institutions; (iii) provide administrative and fiscal oversight of these subawards; and (iv) serve
as the communications interface between IOF awardees, the CCHI steering committee and the NIH.

Tissues
Project Summary
Antibodies against influenza virus protect against infection and reduce morbidity and mortality. As a result,
vaccines against influenza are designed to elicit antibodies against circulating strains of virus. Given that
antibodies are made by B cells, it makes sense to characterize influenza-specific B cells in order to determine
how they are selected, how they function and where they are maintained. However, most studies of influenza-
specific B cells in humans are limited to B cells from peripheral blood, rather than those in lymphoid organs or
the lung. Moreover, most studies characterize influenza-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), which
circulate for a short period after infection or vaccination. Consequently, we have minimal understanding of
influenza-specific memory B cells or ASCs in human tissues. Thus, there is an urgent need to characterize the
phenotypes and functions of influenza-specific B cells in human lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Given this
gap in knowledge, we are proposing experiments that will use â€œB cell tetramersâ€ to identify influenza-specific B
cells responding to hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP) and non-structural-1 (NS1) proteins of influenza
virus in blood, lymphoid tissues, lung and visceral adipose tissues of normal human donors. We will then
determine how the phenotypes, transcriptional programs, functional properties, reactivities and affinities of
those B cells differ between tissues and between B cells of different specificities. Importantly, we will use an
automated, single-cell cloning and antibody-expression system to rapidly and efficiently generate recombinant,
influenza-specific antibodies from sorted memory B cells in order to determine their affinity and cross-reactivity.
Therefore, we believe that this project is highly innovative and will significantly advance our understanding of
influenza-specific B cell biology in various human tissues.",,2019,415709,279939,135770,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related,Frances E.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rickettsia rickettsii is the causative agent of one of the most severe tick-borne diseases in the United States. The compounding factors of rickettsial pathogenicity and route of tick transmission (horizontal and vertical) influence the ecology and epidemiology of human rickettsioses. Our long term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that are central to rickettsial transmission by ticks. The bacterial-derived molecular determinants of rickettsial infection of vertebrate cells have been described using various in vitr models. Our research indicates that rickettsial infection of tick hosts also utilizes similar processes described for infection of vertebrate host cells. However, the role of rickettsial proteins in tick infection is unknown. Likewise, although the tick actively responds to the infecting rickettsiae, the central mechanisms orchestrating the tick-derived response are not known. Thus, the experimental focus of this application emphasizes the roles of pathogenic determinants underlying rickettsial infection and the bacterial-induced alterations of the tick immune response mediating successful rickettsial colonization of the vector. The following specific aims will provide a better understanding of the constituents of rickettsial infection and transmission in arthropod vectors. 1) Defining the contribution of conserved surface cell antigens (Sca) to SFG Rickettsia infection of the tick vector. Sca proteins are known to be essential to rickettsial infection and dissemination in vertebrate cells. We hypothesize that there
will be a distinct profile associated with infection of the arthropod vector. The objective of this
aim is to define the role for rickettsial proteins during the infection process in the tick host. 2 To determine how the tick immune response to SFG Rickettsia correlates to vector competence. A vigorous tick response to SFG Rickettsia supports a species-specific host response to rickettsial infection. Therefore we hypothesize that a central molecule, Relish, is responsible for the balance between successful rickettsial colonization and clearance from the arthropod host. The objective of this aim is to delineate the IMD immune signaling system focusing on the production of active Relish in the tick host.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite the overlapping distribution of ticks with multiple Rickettsia species, in nature, individual tick species are not infected with a diverse range of rickettsial species.

Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1)
through the full projects, identify molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate
cancer, which is present at a higher rate in African American men, and, through the pilot project, adapt the
current, successful patient navigation program for racial/ethnic minority recruitment at the UAB CCC for
implementation at the MSM and Grady Hospital; 2) through the Outreach Core, apply an innovative cancer
survivor care plan at MSM, TU, and the UAB CCC by linking community- and health system-based patient
navigators and advisors to improve satisfaction with care, and implement culturally appropriate community
health education for cancer survivors and caregivers; 3) through the Research Education Core, employ an
integrated cancer research education program that involves capacity building and linkages to undergraduate
and graduate students and junior faculty, allowing them to pursue careers in cancer research; and 4) provide
funding for additional Pilot Research projects. The Planning & Evaluation Core will continually assess/evaluate
the outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared resources. The Bioethics Shared Resource will

This type-2 application is to strengthen and build upon the established U54 Partnership between Morehouse
School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center
(UABCCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically
underserved, African American population, has the overall goal of attaining excellence in research focused on
elimination of cancer health disparities and on reducing the cancer burden among underserved populations in
the region. The partnering institutions possess unique strengths that complement each other in achieving the
proposed goal through integrated research, education, and outreach. The primary objectives are to enhance
productive cancer research programs, to develop a pipeline of racial/ethnic minority investigators in cancer
research at MSM and TU, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators conducting research on
cancer disparities at the UAB CCC. The Partnership has four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Research
Education, and Planning & Evaluation); two Full Research Projects; a Pilot Research Project; and two Shared
Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1)
through the full projects, identify molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate
cancer, which is present at a higher rate in African American men, and, through the pilot project, adapt the
current, successful patient navigation program for racial/ethnic minority recruitment at the UAB CCC for
implementation at the MSM and Grady Hospital; 2) through the Outreach Core, apply an innovative cancer
survivor care plan at MSM, TU, and the UAB CCC by linking community- and health system-based patient
navigators and advisors to improve satisfaction with care, and implement culturally appropriate community
health education for cancer survivors and caregivers; 3) through the Research Education Core, employ an
integrated cancer research education program that involves capacity building and linkages to undergraduate
and graduate students and junior faculty, allowing them to pursue careers in cancer research; and 4) provide
funding for additional Pilot Research projects. The Planning & Evaluation Core will continually assess/evaluate
the outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared resources. The Bioethics Shared Resource will
promote and ensure adherence to bioethical principles and address ethical considerations in relationships

5I01CX001530-02,The Role of Microbial Antigen-Specific T Cells in Crohn's disease,"Microbial-antigen reactive T cells are the primary effectors of inflammatory damage in animal models of
Crohn's disease, causing T cell-mediated colitis only in the presence of gut microbiota. By focusing on a
proposed similar key role for T cells in Crohn's inflammation, we hypothesize that anti-flagellin antibodies that
are highly shared by Crohn's patients, and characterize an aberrant B cell response, are potential markers for
the presence T cell clonotypes that are reactive to the same gut commensal antigens (but different epitopes).
Of note, the presence of anti-CBir1 flagellin antibodies is the strongest predictor of severe, complicated
Crohn's disease.
 Our preliminary data demonstrate two features critical to the success of this long-term project. First,
there is a disease-specific repertoire of expanded T cells (defined by TCRÎ² CDR3 sequences) that is very
highly shared among Crohn's patients, making the study of these T cells' antigen reactivity relevant for the
majority of patients. Second, this highly shared T cell repertoire is associated with patterns of shared serum
anti-flagellin antibodies that are themselves restricted to Crohn's disease patients, suggesting a potential link
between aberrant B cell and T cell responses.
 To accomplish this study, we will enroll active Crohn's patients as well as remission Crohn's patients,
active ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls to test for significant associations between profiles of
serum antibody reactivity to a panel of gut microbial antigens and the TCRÎ² CDR3 repertoire. The goal is to
identify high value CDR3 sequences that couple with cognate flagellin antigens. We plan to define the
distribution of these TCRÎ² CDR3 sequences among peripheral blood and gut tissue T cells subsets (effector,
regulatory and memory) with the goal of identifying sequences that segregate to a particular compartment or
phenotype and to see if the memory T cell subset is a reservoir of highly shared TCRÎ² CDR3 clonotypes.
Lastly we will measure which TCRÎ² CDR3 clonotypes are expanded in vitro following specific antigen
exposure to identify candidate antigen-specific sequences and test for their significant association with antigen
seropositivity and cell phenotype. These data will then be used to isolate single T cells from different
individuals who share identical expanded TCRÎ² CDR3 clonotypes in order to compare the similarity of
structure (Î±/Î² pairing), MHC specificity, and recognition of antigen. The focus will be on targeting highly
shared TCRÎ² CDR3 sequences that have been robustly linked with antigen-specific responses (cytokine
production, proliferation) and seropositivity across multiple Crohn's patients.
 The long-term goals of this project build on these data and aim to define the hierarchy of mechanisms
(antigen peptide binding motifs, MHC promiscuity, e.g.) that contribute to shared antigen reactivity among
Crohn's patients, to develop strategies that disrupt the antigen-specific T cell activation, and to assess the
feasibility and value of targeting microbial antigen-reactive T cells as a treatment approach in Crohn's disease.","This proposal aims to identify the specific T cells that drive the inflammation in Crohn's disease. We
believe that these cells are a primary cause of the inflammatory damage to the gut due to an abnormal
inflammatory response to normal resident bacteria of the GI tract. Our preliminary data show that Crohn's
patients actually share identical T cell receptor antigen-binding regions and that this sharing can be linked with
similarly shared serum antibodies (only seen in Crohn's disease) that are known to recognize specific bacterial
proteins. Based on this link we plan to show that these highly shared T cell receptor regions actually react
against these same bacterial proteins providing a major mechanism of Crohn's disease. We plan to isolate
single T cells so they can be studied more intensively as to how they react to the bacteria and how best to
develop T cell-based strategies that block the activity of these inflammatory T cells.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,Peter  Mannon
5I01BX003272-03,AMP Kinase Activation in Calcineurin Inhibitor Nephrotoxicity,"Solid organ transplantation necessitates the use of lifelong immunosuppression. In particular, the calcineurin
inhibitors (CNIs) are utilized in nearly all transplant recipients as they are potent immunosuppressants. In
kidney transplantation, the use of CNIs has led to the very low rejection rates of ~7-10% per year. However,
long term graft survival has not improved substantially with their utilization, with a mean half-life of 10 years for
kidney transplants. A key contributor to late graft injury is CNI-nephrotoxicity which is manifested by declining
kidney function and the histological features of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arteriolar hyalinosis. The
mechanism by which CNI induce kidney injury and failure is multifactorial, and to date, there are no specific
therapeutic strategies to mitigate this injury. The goal of this submission is to identify a novel and clinically
applicable strategy to ameliorate CNI-associated kidney injury. Recently, AMP-Activated Protein Kinase
(AMPK), a key regulator of cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, has been linked to
modulating kidney injury. Further, loss of AMPK activation is associated with organ inflammation and fibrosis.
We hypothesize that AMPK activation could ameliorate some of the adverse metabolic consequences in renal
tubular epithelium and as a corollary, AMPK activation could be a clinically relevant intervention to mitigate
long term CNI nephrotoxicity. Our study will focus on cyclosporine A (CsA), a classic CNI therapeutic agent.
We will utilize a complementary series of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, using a mouse model of CsA injury
that we have used successfully in our laboratory. In vitro, we will focus on renal tubular epithelium, the primary
target of in vivo injury. We will study both the impact of AMPK activation as well as knock down using
pharmacologic agents and silencing RNAs. Outcomes will include assessments of bioenergetics, mitochondrial
function, pro-inflammatory markers and the DAMP HMGB1, and paracrine impact on macrophages and their
differentiation. In vivo, we will test the impact of AMPK activation on ameliorating CsA renal injury by assessing
kidney function (serum creatinine), mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators within the kidney, and
biochemical, cellular and histologic assessments of injury and fibrosis. We will assess both pre-emptive
inhibition as well as determine the impact of AMPK activation after established CsA nephrotoxicity. To
complement these pharmacologic studies, we will also employ the novel use of AMPK ï¡1 and ï¡2 deficient
mice. Cross-transplant studies will allow us to dissect the role of systemic versus renal expression of AMPK in
injury. We believe that this comprehensive approach will provide key mechanistic insights into ameliorating or
mitigating CNI nephrotoxicity. The use of a clinically relevant activator, metformin, will provide an opportunity
for rapid translation into our human recipients of kidneys and other solid organ transplants.","Solid organ transplantation has revolutionized the care of individuals with organ failure. The VA National
Transplant Program, established in 1962, provides transplants, including bone marrow, heart, liver, pancreas,
lung and kidneys, to Veterans at 12 VA Medical Centers across the continental US. These individuals all
require immunosuppressive medications for their lifetime to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. Nearly all
of these recipients are placed on drugs known as calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). While these drugs are potent
immunosuppressives, they are highly toxic to the kidney and lead to kidney failure over time. Current clinical
management has included dose reduction or avoidance, but sadly, such strategies have negligible success.
This application proposes to study a new mechanism for CNI-caused kidney injury. The study uses both
laboratory and mouse models to find a novel and effective therapy to minimize the nephrotoxic effects of these
critical immunosuppressive agents and to improve patient outcomes after transplant.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,ROSLYN B MANNON
5R01CA222903-02,Oncolytic Immunotherapy using Chimeric HSV C134: A Phase I Trial and Establishment of Response Indicators in Recurrent Glioma Patients,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Gliomas are the most frequently occurring primary malignant brain tumors, with
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) being one of the most fatal and treatment-refractory of all cancers. New
treatments are urgently needed. First-generation oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses (1st gen oHSVs) used in
Phase I clinical trials were safe and produced a 50% response rate however, only a minority of patients had a
durable anti-tumor response. Analysis of the 1st gen oHSV-treated glioma specimens shows that increased
antiviral and immunostimulatory activity in the tumor directly correlates with longer survival in the Phase Ib
study. The 1st Gen oHSVs were designed to restrict viral replication and therefore could not maintain infection
or sustain an antiviral immune response. To improve oHSV antitumor activity, we have developed a next-
generation oHSV, C134, with enhanced immunostimulatory activity. C134 is designed to activate antiviral
cellular pathways important for amplifying the immune response and to improve viral replication in tumor cells.
While it shares a similar safety profile as the 1st gen oHSVs, C134 has superior anti-tumor efficacy in pre-
clinical models. Murine studies also show that C134 more effectively induces T cell and antigen presenting cell
responses that are associated with improved patient survival in the Phase Ib studies.
We will test our hypothesis that â€œC134 is safe and induces immune activity that enhances the anti-tumor
response in patients with recurrent malignant gliomaâ€ by the following aims:
Aim 1: To conduct a Phase I clinical trial to determine a safe C134 (IND 17296) dose in patients with
recurrent malignant glioma. Hypothesis: Intratumoral administration of C134 is safe in patients with recurrent
malignant gliomas. We are ready to start our Phase I trial. Our clinical grade C134 has received regulatory
approval from the NIH-Recombinant DNA Council (RAC) and FDA-Investigational New Drug (IND#17296).
C134 will be intratumorally-administered to patients using a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) design
and will be monitored for C134 safety and tolerability.
AIM 2 To monitor immune response changes associated with oHSV mediated anti-tumor responses
among C134-treated patients. Hypothesis: C134-induced antiviral and Th1 immune activity contribute to anti-
tumor efficacy and can be inferred from peripheral blood samples. Our past clinical trial results indicate that
oHSV-induced immune activity is associated with improved survival. We will therefore monitor patient's
peripheral blood (immunophenotyping and cytokine) after C134-treatment and define how immune response
changes relate to anti-tumor response. Studies will also examine how sustained viral activity and T cell clonal
changes contribute to the C134-anti-tumor response.
Impact: Successful completion of these studies is the first step in establishing an effective therapy for an
incurable tumor and would provide a way to monitor and potentially enhance the virotherapeutic response.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

We are requesting three years of support to conduct an open-label, dose-escalating, Phase I clinical trial in
subjects with recurrent malignant glioma (MG) to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), safety
and toxicities of a novel modification of a âˆ†Î³134.5 Herpes Simplex Virus (âˆ†Î³134.5 HSV) that expresses human
interleukin-12 (M032, NSC733972). This oncolytic HSV was developed under a Program Project Grant
(CA071933) and has been extensively tested in vitro and preclinically in two animal species, including nonhuman
primates. These studies have shown M032 to be as safe as other clinical oncolytic âˆ†Î³134.5 HSV (G207, 1716)
used intracerebrally, to have no unexpected toxicities in immunocompromised mice or immunocompetent
animals (mice, non-human primates), and to replicate 10-1000 fold better than G207 in a variety of preclinical
models of MG. We have conducted three Phase I clinical trials with G207 in a similar patient population (17 of
35 subjects had objective responses) and will apply our unique knowledge and experience to evaluate this novel
HSV. The NExT program produced cGMP clinical grade M032 (NSC733972) at >3 x 109 PFU/ml, generating
>560 single-dose vials. The FDA has issued IND #14,946, a trial protocol and informed consent were IRB-
approved and the first subject has been treated without DLTs (NCT02062827). In Aim 1, this first-in-human
Phase I clinical trial will use a modified Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) to determine dose modifications
to obtain both safety and toxicity data as well as secondary biologic correlative information critical to assessing
the potential application of this virus to treat malignant brain tumors. Subjects with biopsy-proven recurrent MG
will have M032 infused (400Î¼l/hr x 6 hrs) in up to four sites in the enhancing tumor mass via stereotactically
placed catheters and will be monitored adverse effects and survival. Dose escalation in each subsequent subject
will occur after a 24 day interval and will be defined by the CRM. We will determine the RP2D, will identify any
unanticipated toxicities and will determine, secondarily, progression-free and overall survivals. In Aim 2, we will
simultaneously acquire biological specimens from each subject on a designated longitudinal timeline and
process these for immediate analyses or for cryopreservation and batch analyses at a later time. We propose
to: a) assess M032 shedding in blood, saliva, and conjunctival secretions by virus culture and PCR; b) document
serological (antibody titers) and cellular immune responses (profiling, proliferation and function of immune
subsets) to M032 infusion; c) define changes from an immune suppressing environment to an immune enhancing
environment, including changes in circulating cytokines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; and d) establish
tumor genotype differences that might reveal molecular bases for tumor susceptibility or resistance. Previously
archived tumor tissues (when available) and blood DNA will be analyzed to provide an in-depth molecular profile
for each subject's tumor. Analyses will be focused to define a RP2D of M032 and will consider all clinical variables
and correlative parameters to better inform future trial designs for the best outcomes.","Â

5R01DK115473-02,Role of Vitamin D in the Prevention and Progression of Urinary Incontinence,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Overactive bladder (OAB), the presence of urgency, frequency, and nocturia, is common with aging, as is
urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). These are among the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms â€“
associated with worse mental health, poor physical well-being, and increased falls, fractures, and nursing
home placement. Despite treatment options, many patients do not become symptom-free and discontinue
medications due to side effects or perceived inefficacy. Attention is shifting to possible prevention and early
treatment strategies. Potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several relevant organ systems, and vitamin
D could act via multiple pathways to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by improving detrusor activity and
decreasing inflammation. Indeed, evidence emerging from epidemiologic studies indicate that higher vitamin D
levels are associated with decreased risk for OAB and UI.
 In this revision application, we will leverage two large, complementary epidemiologic studies â€“ the VITamin D
and omegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, n=25,000 women and men) and the observational Nursesâ€™ Health Studies
(n>100,000 women) -- to conduct a rich exploration of vitamin D and OAB, as well as UUI. In this revision, we
extend research to both OAB and UUI, increasing clinical relevance by broadening the outcomes (previously
only UI) while focusing on symptoms related to detrusor contractility. We also improve innovation by targeting
research in: (1) African Americans (n=2300 in NHS, n=5200 in VITAL), who disproportionately suffer from OAB
and UUI, and have higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; and in (2) obese adults (n=34,000 in NHS,
n=7200 in VITAL), who are at higher risk of OAB and UUI, and have lower bioavailability of vitamin D as it is
retained in adipose tissue. Our main Aims are to: 1) assess if vitamin D3 supplementation decreases OAB and
UUI in VITAL, where participants have been assigned to 2000IU/day of vitamin D or placebo for five years, and
in NHS, where observational data are available on a large range of doses, from <400 IU to >800 and >1000
IU/day; and 2) to prospectively assess if higher plasma 25(OH)D levels at baseline are related to a decreased
incidence and progression of UUI in the NHS. In VITAL, where an estimated 50% of participants had
25(OH)D<30ng/mL at baseline, we propose to collect data on OAB and UI symptoms at year 5 by adding new
questions on urgency, frequency, nocturia and urine leakage at the close of the trial. The NHS already includes
extensive UUI data, and we will newly measure baseline vitamin D levels from stored blood samples and add
OAB questions in upcoming follow-up periods. The large samples of African American and of obese adults in
these cohorts uniquely enable important and novel research. The expected outcomes will be to provide
exciting new knowledge regarding vitamin D as a possible convenient, low-cost intervention for
preventing OAB and UUI symptoms and progression among women and men, specifically targeting
high-risk subgroups of African Americans and obese adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Overactive bladder (OAB) can occur with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). OAB and UUI affects
the lives of millions of men and women and is very costly. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic studies link
higher vitamin D levels with lower rates of OAB and UUI. With this proposal, our goal is to understand the
relationship of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo on OAB and UUI symptoms, especially in high-
risk subgroups. We will also evaluate how supplementation may improve new-onset OAB and UUI over time.",2019,352480,313810,38670,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Interstitial Cystitis; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention; Urologic Diseases,Alayne Denise Markland
5U01DK106858-05,"Pathways to LUTS Prevention: A Model for Public Education, Behavioral Skills, and Early Detection","ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms including urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, bladder pain syndrome, and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. There is an extensive literature describing the many approaches to treatment of LUTS, but much less is known about prevention. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors for LUTS, but evidence is lacking for the roles of behavioral factors, including how we learn our bladder habits,
whether they affect the risk of developing LUTS, and what defines healthy bladder habits. The primary aim of this proposal is to participate as a Clinical Center in the ""Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Women: Bladder Health Clinical Centers"" (PLUS) Research Consortium and work with other centers to examine the existing evidence and plan foundational studies for development of future trials of prevention interventions for LUTS. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Continence Team is an interdisciplinary group of investigators from behavioral science, geriatrics, preventive medicine, public health, urogynecology, and urology. Our epidemiological work includes identifying risk factors for incident incontinence using the NIA-funded UAB longitudinal Study of Aging, national VA databases, and risk factor analyses of NHANES data. The depth of the UAB team covers all aspects of LUTS clinical trial design and conduct (including NIH multi-site networks), evaluation and treatment of LUTS in women, and a strong track record of recruitment and retention of both patients and control subjects (including being a Vanguard Center for the NHLBI Women's Health Initiative). The second aim is to address known gaps in current epidemiological knowledge, through a prospective longitudinal cohort study to assess a range of behavioral factors and their effect on the incidence and progression of LUTS. Understanding the roles of bladder health behaviors will support the development of a risk model for identifying individuals and groups at risk for LUTS, as well as inform public education initiatives. The third aim is to conduct foundational studies guided by our conceptual framework to develop three potential pathways to prevention of LUTS: public education initiatives targeted across the lifespan to convey knowledge and dispel myths about healthy bladder habits and LUTS; skill-based interventions for young women and at-risk groups to teach evidence-based behavioral skills and healthy bladder habits; and detection of and self-administered interventions for early LUTS. The plan of studies includes 1) the longitudinal cohort study, which will also provide meaningful content for public education campaigns, 2) a survey of providers to assess feasibility of teaching pelvic floor muscle control and healthy bladder habits to young women at a time of relative readiness - the first gynecology encounter, and 3) developing and pilot testing an internet-based, self-administered behavioral intervention including a smart-phone application as a practical first step in addressing early LUTS. Findings from these studies will lay the foundation for future trials of interventions to prevent LUTS in women across the lifespan.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms that affect women of all ages.

2P30AI027767-31,SWG Ending HIV in Alabama,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ending HIV in Alabama Scientific Working Group (SWG)
The UAB CFAR is at the forefront of research investigating psychosocial and behavioral factors influencing all
aspects of the HIV prevention and treatment care continuums in targeted social, cultural, economic,
geographical, and healthcare settings, situated in the Deep South. Formed in 2017, the Ending HIV in Alabama
SWG promotes interdisciplinary research in this especially vulnerable region through: 1) development of novel
approaches to improve outcomes in prevention, testing, linkage to care, retention in care, and viral suppression;
2) implementation of evidence-based interventions through coordination of interdisciplinary teams; and 3)
recruitment and mentoring of trainees and early stage investigators in epidemiologic and implementation science
research aimed at eliminating HIV in Alabama. These are crucial steps to controlling the domestic HIV epidemic.
The overarching goal of the SWG is to lead the statewide effort to eliminate HIV in Alabama by promoting
advances in HIV research and innovation. SWG membership reflects a broad range of clinical, epidemiologic,
socio-behavioral, community, and implementation science experts working together. Our areas of research
consist of scaling up proven HIV prevention interventions including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) targeted to
local HIV incidence informed by geospatial modeling, biomedical and behavioral intervention development to
improve engagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy to optimize viral suppression, and
epidemiological and biostatistical methods to refine measurement of baseline and post-intervention endpoints.
The SWG goals over the next project period include: adding 10 investigators to HIV research; developing novel
partnerships at the community, regional, and state levels; funding five pilot grants commensurate with the SWG
aims facilitated by intra-CFAR synergy with Core B; securing at least five funded NIH R-level awards based on
findings from the SWGâ€™s early work; publishing 20 peer-reviewed manuscripts that represent clinical and
scientific advances aligned with the SWGâ€™s goals; organizing training workshops focused on HIV-related
implementation science and geospatial methodologies; and hosting an annual symposium with community
partners highlighting our progress towards Ending HIV in Alabama. Progress in these goals will ultimately lead
Alabama closer to the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets and the U.S. National HIV/AIDS strategy goals. Based on 2017
HIV surveillance estimates, achieving these targets will require a 7% increase in the number of diagnosed people
living with HIV, and a 35% and 61% increase in care engagement and viral suppression, respectively, in the
state of Alabama.
The SWG structure within the UAB CFAR is uniquely positioned to confront the disproportionate burden of the
HIV epidemic on the Southern U.S. while advancing the scientific agenda of the CFAR and the NIH Office of
AIDS Research priorities.",,2019,26143,17605,8538,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Substance Abuse,JEANNE M MARRAZZO

The 2019 STI and HIV World Congress comprises the 23rd biennial meeting of the International Society for
Sexually Transmitted Diseases Research (ISSTDR), which is jointly held with the 20th meeting of the International
Union Against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI). ISSTDR was founded in 1977 and is governed by an
International Board of Directors that currently represents 6 countries. IUSTI, which is on the Roster of the United
Nations Economic and Social Council and is an Official Non-Government Organization in Consultative Status
with the World Health Organization, was founded in 1923 and is organised on both a global and regional basis.
It is the oldest international organization with the objective of fostering international cooperation in the control of
STI including HIV/AIDS. The two organizations met independently until 2013, when the first joint STI & HIV
World Congress was held in Vienna, Austria; that meeting was co-chaired by Dr. Thomas Quinn of the NIH and
Johns Hopkins and received critical support from the NIH Division of AIDS.
The STI & HIV World Congress marries cutting-edge and highly topical research themes with critical public health
policy decisions in the fields of STI and HIV/AIDS. STIs, in particular syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, are
frequently acquired concurrently with HIV and are increasingly occurring in persons living with HIV; these STIs
also increase the acquisition and transmission of HIV. Thus, HIV elimination strategies benefit significantly from
consideration of the impact of STI/HIV co-infections, and joint approaches to control both epidemics. As such,
the STI & HIV World Congress is the major forum for cross-disciplinary discussions among leading experts on
optimal strategies for decreasing the public health burden of STIs and HIV worldwide.

5R01NS093941-04,Whole-body therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal storage diseases consist of >40 distinct disorders, each having an underlying defect in lysosomal function that leads to storage of normally degraded substrates. Lysosomal diseases have a cumulative prevalence of 1 in 7,700 live births, similar in frequency to cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. All lysosomal storage diseases
affect peripheral organs to some degree, and the majority also attack the central nervous system (CNS). Though effective treatments have been developed for peripheral manifestations of some lysosomal diseases, those with neurological components have been virtually untreatable. A new therapeutic era is at hand for lysosomal storage diseases with neurological involvement. Intracranial injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has led to > 4-fold increases in life span and vastly improved quality of life in mice and cats with Sandhoff disease, a type of GM2 gangliosidosis caused by a lack of the enzyme hexosaminidase. In fact, AAV vectors address the central nervous system disease component so successfully that peripheral disease becomes the primary barrier to long-term survival. A second barrier to successful clinical application in humans is the risk of directly injecting the brain, especially in children ith progressive neurologic disease. The current proposal will minimize risk and optimize vector delivery to the brain, spinal cord and peripheral organs to treat CNS and peripheral disease simultaneously. Aims include the following: (1) Optimize treatment of the brain and spinal cord by injection of AAV into the cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral effect also will be tested, but the primary goal of Aim 1 is treatment of the CNS. (2) Treat peripheral organs by intravascular delivery of AAV. Effect in the brain and spinal cord also will be measured, but the primary goal of Aim 2 is treatment of the periphery. (3) Evaluate whole-body AAV therapy through simultaneous application of cerebrospinal fluid and intravascular approaches. This project will investigate a new AAV capsid that transduces the brain at high efficiency, a bicistronic vector that expresses both subunits of hexosaminidase from a single construct, a combination of treatment approaches not previously reported and clinical assays such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging/ spectroscopy at high field strength (7 Tesla). Conclusions from this project will inform future human clinical trials for GM2 gangliosidosis.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: First reported in 1881, GM2 gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases) are lysosomal storage disorders usually fatal by 5 years of age after a long period of neurodegeneration leading to a semi-vegetative state. Though no treatment exists currently, AAV gene therapy in mouse and larger animal models has proven effective, justifying the pursuit of human clinical trials. The current application builds upon previous work to develop second-generation gene therapy approaches, which maximize safety and treat peripheral pathology through cerebrospinal fluid and/or intravascular delivery routes.",2019,584327,489966,94361,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE,368325888,Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases,MIGUEL S ESTEVES; DOUGLAS R MARTIN
1F31AR076234-01,Biopsyochosocial Mechanisms of Lupus Progression in African American Women,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease that disproportionally
burdens African American women with more rapid disease progression and worse outcomes compared to their
White counterparts. Increasing evidence suggests racial disparities in SLE progression are due in part to
disproportionate exposure to psychosocial stress, as well as qualitatively unique racial minority stressors,
which accelerate physiologic deterioration and may undermine shared inflammatory stress-response pathways
involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Routine experiences of psychosocial stress are common in the lives of
African American women with SLE and can include stressors inherent with managing a chronic illness, in
addition to those stemming from community disadvantage and poverty. African American women also face
distinct forms of psychosocial stress, including experiences of racial discrimination and exposure to other race-
related stressors. Despite existing evidence, mechanisms for racial disparities in SLE progression are poorly
understood. To address these gaps in knowledge among African American women with SLE, this study aims
to: (1) examine understudied dimensions of race-related psychosocial stress in relation to disease activity and
organ damage; (2) examine the influence of area-level neighborhood characteristics and stressors on rates of
SLE progression; and (3) identify trajectories in biomarkers of inflammation relevant to SLE and identify high-
risk subgroups. Data for the proposed analyses are from the Black Women's Experiences Living with Lupus
(BeWELL) Study, one of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the social epidemiology of SLE. The
BeWELL Study represents a rigorous assessment of rich psychosocial factors, validated measures of disease
outcomes, and objective inflammatory biomarkers among an innovative population-based sample of African
American women with confirmed SLE (n=438) living in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The proposed research
will leverage the strengths of the BeWELL Study and yield insight into specific pathways that may contribute to
the disproportionate rate of SLE progression experienced by African American women. We will investigate the
role of novel race-related psychosocial stressors on SLE outcomes, including â€œsecondhandâ€ or vicarious
exposure to racist incidents, subtle everyday slights or microaggressions, and anticipation of experiencing
racial threats. Multilevel analyses will examine the influence of spatial factors, specifically socioeconomic
disadvantage and racial residential segregation on SLE outcomes. Trajectories in inflammation will be
identified and explored in relation to sociodemographic, mental and physical health factors. Longitudinal
methodological approaches will be utilized to help support causal inference. Training activities throughout the
proposed fellowship will develop skill sets and enhance knowledge needed to conduct the intended analyses
and prepare for a career in research. Various opportunities for professional development and mentorship from
a diverse team of scholars will facilitate this goal.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5U18FD005553-05,Improving the Food Testing Capability of Alabama Public Health Laboratories,"Abstract
The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) Bureau of Clinical Laboratories
(BCL) is identified as the primary laboratory for conducting microbiological and
chemical food analyses on behalf of the ADPH Bureau of Environmental Servicesâ€™
Manufactured Food Regulatory Program (MFRP). According to Standard 10, the
primary laboratory must perform testing in conformance with ISO/IEC 17025:2005
standards. Laboratory accreditation for performing food testing is critical for ensuring
defensible data and providing prompt and appropriate state and federal response to
foodborne illness outbreaks and emergencies.
Therefore, the goal of this project is to achieve and maintain ISO/IEC 17025:2005
accreditation for the BCLâ€™s microbiological and chemical food testing programs which
will help satisfy MFRP Standard 10. This will require enhancements to the Quality
Assurance program to upgrade to the more stringent process requirements for this
prestigious accreditation. The schema for accomplishing the objectives for this
accreditation includes an initial quality management system assessment and gap
analysis; implementation of processes to address gaps identified; development of a
timeframe to address identified gaps; scheduling of final assessment; and achieving
ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation status.
Laboratory quality management personnel will participate in the initial gap analysis and
subsequently be primarily responsible for developing practices and procedures for
meeting accreditation requirements processes. Testing personnel familiar with the
technical and operational aspects of chemical and microbiological food laboratory
practices will participate in the initial gap analysis and will subsequently be primarily
involved with developing practices and procedures to meet analytic laboratory
accreditation requirements. Informatics personnel will develop and implement tools to
achieve and maintain processes and mechanisms for the timely and accurate sharing of
laboratory data with federal agencies for regulatory, surveillance, and emergency
response activities.","Project Narrative

5U01ES027697-04,CIALISÂ® reverses halogen induced injury to pregnant animals and their offspring,"The halogen bromine (Br2) is used as water disinfectant, for bleaching fibers, for manufacturing antiepileptic
drugs, dyestuffs, flame-retardants, insecticides, drilling fluids, and gasoline additives. When inhaled, it causes
exposure-level-dependent acute and chronic pulmonary and systemic injuries ranging from mild eye and
airway irritation, to significant damage to cardiopulmonary system and other organs, which can lead to death.
Survivors may develop reactive airway disease syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis as well as restrictive and
obstructive pulmonary diseases. Presently, there are no studies evaluating acute and chronic sequelae of Br2
inhalation in pregnant rodent and non-rodent models, even though US census bureau data predicts two of
every 100 people in the US being pregnant. Exposure of pregnant mice at gestational day 15 (E15) to Br2 (600
ppm for 30 min.) results in 75% mortality over four days, in contrast to 25% mortality in males or non-pregnant
females (p<0001). When delivered at E19, fetuses of surviving Br2-exposed mice exhibit severe fetal growth
restriction (FGR) and fetal demise (FD). Placentas are poorly developed and express increased levels of
short-FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an anti-angiogenic mediator and biomarker of both preeclampsia and
pulmonary hypertension. When born naturally, none of the fetuses survive. Oral administration of an FDA-
approved type 5 cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5i; tadalafil) to the dams post-
exposure, dramatically improved maternal survival, fetal growth restriction and neonatal survival. We
hypothesize that brominated intermediates, formed by the reaction of Br2 and HOBr with plasmalogens cause
injury to the endothelium and the placenta, inducing the release of vasoconstrictor and anti-angiogenic
mediators which in turn mediate pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased pulmonary artery pressure and right
ventricular dysfunction. Tadalafil restores pulmonary and uterine vasodilation, preserves heart function and
improves uterine/placental blood supply resulting in maternal and fetal survival. We will test these proposed
mechanisms and we will perform the necessary efficacy studies to identify the optimum therapeutic regimen of
tadalafil to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality, improve fetal growth restriction and increase fetal
survival when administered orally post exposure. Specific Aim #1. To test the hypothesis that exposure of
pregnant mice to Br2 at E15 causes extensive pulmonary injury as well as systemic endothelial injury, placental
injury, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure resulting in maternal mortality, fetal growth restriction and
fetal demise/stillbirth. Specific Aim #2: To identify the sequence of events and mechanisms involved in the
development of maternal vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Specific Aim #3. To
investigate the efficacy of post halogen exposure administration of tadalafil to decrease maternal and fetal
death and morbidity and to develop a rabbit (non-rodent) model of Br2 toxicity in pregnancy.","Project Narrative

5U01ES026458-05,Bromine Inhalation Induced Lung Injury: Novel Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies,"?   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bromine (Br2) is a highly toxic dark-reddish liquid, which evaporates readily to a red vapor with a suffocating odor. World production of Br2 exceeds 300,000 tons per year. Exposure to Br2 causes acute lung injury, death from respiratory failure, and fibrosis. Because of the potential for industrial and transportation accidents to release of large amounts of Br2 in populated areas, Br2 presents a clear and present danger to public health. Few published studies have evaluated the acute and chronic sequelae of Br2 inhalation; treatment remains symptomatic and no effective countermeasures exist. Similar to human pathology, exposure of mice to Br2 causes reactive airway disease syndrome (RADS), increased permeability of the blood gas barrier to plasma proteins, and inflammation followed by sub-epithelial airway fibrosis and significant mortality. The overall purpose of this application is to identify the biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for these events and develop appropriate countermeasures. We propose that Br2 and hypobromous acid (HOBr-) interact with and fragment high molecular weight hyaluronan (H-HA), a ubiquitous matrix glycosaminoglycan, to generate highly inflammatory low molecular weight hyaluronan fragments (L-HA). L- HA binds to CD44 and Toll like receptor (TLR)-4, increases intracellular Ca+2 and activates TGF-?1, and RhoA in lung epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells. These events lead to RADS, increased epithelial permeability to plasma proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) of airway cells, sub-epithelial fibrosis, an death from respiratory failure. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time the formation of brominated lipids in the lungs and plasma of mice exposed to Br2. These compounds, formed by the interaction of Br2 with lung plasmalogens, mediate and amplify Br2 lung injury and act as biomarkers of Br2 exposure. Based on solid data we posit that post-Br2 exposure administration of aerosolized Yabro? (a form of H-HA, currently in clinical trials in Europe for asthma), attenuates lung damage, enhances repair and decreases mortality. Experiments proposed in the first specific aim will assess physiological, biochemical, and morphological changes in mice exposed to Br2 and returned to room air for up to three weeks and test the effectiveness of aerosolized Yabro? administered post exposure to decrease lung injury and mortality. We will then identify the mechanisms by which Br2 damages rodent and human airway smooth muscle (ASM), bronchial and alveolar type II (ATII) cells. We posit that Br2, brominated lipids, and L-HA increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate RhoA, which lead to increased airway contractility and epithelial permeability. Experiments will: (i) determine membrane potentials by patch clamp; (ii) intracellular Ca+2 by fura-2 fluorescence; (iii) RhoA and ROCK activation; (iv) myosin light chain phosphorylation; and (v) (for epithelial cells) permeability to fluorescent dextrans. Finally, we wll isolate mouse tracheal rings at 1, 24, and 72 hr. post Br2 exposure and measure smooth muscle contraction in response to methacholine.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: World production of Br2 exceeds 300,000 tons per year and accidental spills into the environment during transportation and industrial accidents are common.

7R01MH108412-04,PrEP uptake/adherence to reduce periconception HIV risk for South African women,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In HIV-endemic settings, many HIV-uninfected women choose to conceive with an HIV-infected or unknown- serostatus partner. For a woman who cannot depend on a partner to test, initiate and adhere to ART, sex without condoms puts her at high risk of acquiring HIV and increases the risk of perinatal transmission to her child. Daily, oral TDF/FTC PrEP dramatically reduces a woman's risk of HIV-acquisition and is the only female-controlled option for reducing her risk of periconception HIV-acquisition. Understanding whether daily, oral PrEP is feasible for uninfected women seeking pregnancy is critical to reducing HIV incidence among women and their children. We propose a single-arm study to offer daily, oral PrEP for periconception use to 350 HIV-uninfected women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa who report personal or partner plans for pregnancy with an infected or unknown serostatus partner. Women who become pregnant on PrEP will have the option to continue PrEP during pregnancy. PrEP will be offered as part of a safer conception package inclusive of couples-based HIV counseling and testing. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the proportion of women initiating PrEP and determine factors associated with uptake. In Aim 2, we will evaluate objectively-measured PrEP adherence during periconception and pregnancy follow-up. Level, patterns, and correlates of adherence will be evaluated using plasma drug concentrations and electronic pill caps. Our primary outcome is prevalence of protective plasma tenofovir concentrations (> 40 ng/ml). We will also evaluate median adherence to dispensed pills with electronic pill caps. From formative studies in South Africa, we hypothesize that adherence to a proven intervention (TDF/FTC PrEP) for a defined risk period (periconception, pregnancy) with a clear end point (live birth) will be high (protective tenofovir concentrations at 80% of visits, adherence to >80% of prescribed pills). In Aim 3, longitudinal quantitative data and in-depth interviews with initially high- and low-adhering participants will inform our conceptual framework for periconception PrEP uptake and adherence. Placebo-controlled trials identified adherence as a major challenge to long-term PrEP use. However, women are eager for prevention strategies that allow for conception, and we hypothesize that adherence to a proven prevention strategy, for a limited time with the motivation to have a healthy child, will confer drug levels required to prevent HIV transmission. Consistent with PA11-275 ""Discovery, Development, & Testing of Novel Interventions to Advance HIV Prevention and Care"", this application advances combination approaches to HIV- prevention and targets a population highly affected by the pandemic. This project will determine whether daily, oral PrEP is a feasible HIV-prevention strategy for South African women who conceive with risky partners. Given the repercussions of acquiring HIV during conception and pregnancy, this is an important step towards providing a key prevention strategy to women and their children.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women who choose to conceive with an infected or unknown serostatus partner in HIV-endemic settings need prevention strategies to reduce periconception HIV acquisition risk. Women at high risk for acquiring HIV during pregnancy also need risk reduction strategies to protect themselves and their babies. Evaluating uptake of and adherence to antiretrovirals as pre-exposure prophylaxis in this population is crucial to understanding whether and how this prevention strategy should be incorporated into HIV-risk reduction packages for at-risk women planning or with pregnancy.,2019,562635,462511,100124,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Prevention,Lynn T Matthews
5R01AR072697-02,Nanoscale structure and function of desmosomes,"Project Summary
The epidermis provides protection from environmental insult, dehydration and stress. Mechanical strength is
derived from robust cell-cell adhesive junctions called desmosomes is a fundamental feature of epidermal
tissue. Desmosomes are macromolecular complexes composed of desmosomal cadherins, which mediate cell-
cell adhesion, and a number of intracellular plaque proteins, including desmoplakin, which couples the complex
to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Notably, aberrant desmosome function can lead to severe epidermal
disorders. Pemphigus vulgaris is a potentially life-threatening skin blistering disease caused by autoantibodies
directed against the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3 (Dsg3) that leads to disruption of cell-cell adhesion.
Though responsible for mechanical integrity, desmosomes can switch between strong and weak states in
development and wound healing. This functional transition occurs with minimal change to the core proteins
comprising the desmosome. We hypothesize that the architecture or organization of proteins within a
desmosome drives its adhesive function. However, due to the size and molecular complexity of desmosomes
there is a lack of tools to study this structure-function relationship creating a critical barrier in this field. We will
use a multi-disciplinary approach to address this challenge and to test the hypothesis that the biophysical
organization of proteins in the desmosome provides a mechanism to regulate adhesion. We recently
developed two highly innovative and complimentary super-resolution fluorescence microscopy approaches to
study the order and organization of proteins within desmosomes. Our goal is to elucidate how the order and
organization of proteins impacts the adhesive function of desmosomes in healthy and disease states. This will
provide novel insight into the structure and function of these critical complexes. In Aim 1 we will determine the
how the organization of plaque proteins changes in different adhesive states with the goal of identifying
functionally sensitive elements and potential biomarkers. In Aim 2 we will use a live cell approach to study
mechanisms that confer ordering of desmosomal cadherins, and how this order is altered with function. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will define changes to the architecture of the desmosome induced in pemphigus vulgaris, with the
goal of facilitating development of targeted therapeutics. We will use primary human keratinocytes and human
tissue biopsy samples to address these questions. Accomplishment of these goals will provide a fundamental
understanding and framework of how protein organization and dynamics influence the adhesive function of
desmosomes in healthy and disease states.","Project Narrative
A number of human diseases of the skin and heart are caused by defects in the adhesive function or signaling
activity of desmosomes. The goal of this proposal is to provide novel insight into how desmosome structure is

1R21CA234764-01A1,Novel fluorinated amino ester prodrugs for PET imaging of gliomas,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and a deadly disease with a median life
expectancy of approximately fourteen months. The imaging and treatment of GBM and other gliomas is
complicated by tumor regions with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and difficulty in distinguishing treatment
effects from viable tumor. Many conventional contrast agents including gadolinium chelates for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) tracers do not cross the BBB and, therefore,
cannot visualize the entire tumor. A leading class of PET agents, radiolabeled amino acids (AAs) targeting
system L amino acid transport, can cross the BBB. However, system L substrates have limitations due to
bidirectional transport and washout from some tumors over time. The shortcomings of current neuroimaging
techniques result in diagnostic uncertainty, leading to numerous equivocal imaging studies, delays in treatment
of recurrences, overtreatment due to false positive imaging results such as radiation necrosis, and in some cases
futile therapies.
To address the urgent critical need for improved GBM imaging agents, we have developed a novel 18F-labeled
amino ester prodrug-based imaging strategy. Our novel 18F-labeled amino ester prodrugs are expected to cross
the intact BBB through lipophilic diffusion, undergo cleavage by esterases, and provide higher tumor to brain
ratios than system L tracers by concentrating in tumor cells through uptake by AA transporter systems. These
properties are expected to lead to higher sensitivity for detecting viable tumor tissue, more accurate definition of
tumor boundaries, and better assessment of treatment response than with MRI and currently available PET
tracers. This approach will improve the diagnosis, treatment planning, and response assessment in GBM,
ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. In addition, our advance will provide new tools for assessing
metabolic pathways involving AAs that do not cross the BBB, such as glutamine. This project will pursued
through two Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Synthesize and characterize the cleavage of 18F-labeled amino ester prodrugs by brain esterases
and measure the uptake of the corresponding free amino acids by GBM cells.
Specific Aim 2: Measure in vivo brain availability and tumor imaging properties of the lead amino ester prodrugs
in GBM PDX models.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This research plan focuses on the development and preclinical evaluation of novel 18F-labeled amino ester
prodrugs as optimized positron emission tomography (PET) agents for imaging glioblastoma and other brain
tumors. A key feature of our novel agents is the use of a cleavable ester that will allow us to image amino acid
uptake by glioma cells throughout the tumor volume including regions with relatively intact blood-brain barrier
function. These improved PET tracers are expected to better guide the use of both established and experimental
therapies, leading to more accurate diagnosis and improved outcomes for neuro-oncology patients.",2019,208271,140250,68021,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases,Jonathan Edward McConathy

knowledge and innovation in the area of arsenical chemical threat and applied toxicology. The UAB CARE-
Core will provide complementary short-term multidisciplinary education in applied toxicological research related
to arsenicals and other dermally active chemical agents. This will be achieved by creating and expanding local
and remote capabilities for facilitating the development of key skill sets in its investigators, technicians,
postdoctoral fellows (MD and PhD scientists), and medical, graduate and undergraduate students, with the
goal of increasing the number and capabilities of researchers in the field. It is our objective to enhance interest
in research related to chemical threats and biodefense and to encourage expanded research programs across
our institution and field. The UAB CARE-Core will support the key component of the NIH strategy to identify,
develop, support, and maintain the quality of our scientific human capital in the scientific research workforce by
fostering diversity in all of its educational programs. The educational activities of the UAB CARE-Core will be
organized along three focus areas related to acute chemical threats: basic science, clinical and translational
science, and multidisciplinary outreach. These focus areas reflect the highly multidisciplinary and translational
nature of applied toxicology. The Center's scientific arsenicals-related activities and findings will be used in the
UAB CARE-Core's educational offerings to help motivate and unify the Core activities, although the
educational themes will be common to a range of dermally active chemical agents, emphasizing broader points
in applied toxicology. Finally, the UAB CARE-Core affirms its commitment regarding Responsible Conduct of
Research (RCR) training. In addition to UAB's required RCR trainings, RCR training topics will be imbedded
into educational offerings provided by the Core each project year. All educational activities will take place at the
Center's Research and Development Project sites and in clinical and educational sites across UAB. Distance-

Reducing Youth Violence and Racism/Discrimination: The Efficacy of Comprehensive
Prevention Strategies (CPS) project is being submitted to National Institute of Health: Youth
Violence Prevention Interventions that Incorporate Racism/Discrimination Prevention (R01).
This study will evaluate the effects of a comprehensive intervention addressing (a) individual, (b)
educator, (c) school, and (d) community-levels variables. Specifically, interracial and intraracial
youth aggression and school disengagement will be analyzed through a quasi-randomized
control trial of Coping Power versus Coping Power+, a newly developed version with racism and
discrimination content. Educator outcomes will be evaluated by school-level randomization to
traditional SWPBIS alone or SWPBIS+ implicit bias training and culturally responsive
adaptations. Finally, community risk will be evaluated through parental involvement in either
traditional Coping Power Parent program or the Coping Power Parent Program+, that includes
racism and discrimination content. The purpose of the CPS intervention which includes CP+
and SWPBIS+ is to preventatively address individual, school, and community risk for youth
violence and aggression, particularly related to racially based aggression and violence by
intervening at multiple entry points and leveraging the evidence-based Coping Power and
SWPBIS approaches to include much-needed adaptations.
This project will include a 5-year randomized control trial with four conditions: (a) SWPBIS and
CP (serving as control), (b) SWPBIS+ and CP, (c) SWPBIS and CP+, and (d) SWPBIS+ and
CP+. Project planning and student screening will occur in Year 1, with three cohorts of schools
and students in intervention in Years 2-4, and follow-up data for the Year 4 cohort collected in
Year 5. Twenty middle schools (6th to 8th grade) in large districts in Alabama, representing
diverse student populations across race and poverty levels will be included in the project. To
address Aim 1, 20 schools implementing Tier 1 SWPBIS to criterion (i.e., a score of at least
70% on a validated fidelity measure; Mercer et al., 2017) will be randomly assigned to the Tier 1
conditions: SWPBIS+ training or continued SWPBIS implementation. Within each middle school
(6th and 7h grade), students with high levels of externalizing behavior (top 25% based on
screening, described below) will be recruited and randomly assigned to CP or CP+. At each of
the 20 schools, 17 children will be included for CP intervention for each new cohort in Years 2-4,
yielding 1,020 students total with 510 students in each condition for the CP vs. CP+ contrast.","Project Narrative

5R00HL121087-05,Network Medicine Approaches to Cachexia in COPD,"Cachexia, featuring rapid loss of weight and muscle, is common to many complex diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) and cancer. Regardless of the primary disease diagnosis, the presence of cachexia is associated with poor prognosis. Equally important is the observation that not every patient diagnosed with a complex disease such as COPD and CHF becomes cachectic. This information motivated me to hypothesize that there are common genes and pathways influencing cachexia in these different complex, chronic traits. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States and it has been estimated that as high as 20% of COPD cases develop cachexia, however this number may be overestimated due to limitations associated with defining cachexia. The development of cachexia is a strong predictor of mortality. This study has three specific aims: 1) Identify genetic and genomic variants associated with cachexia and related traits in COPD; 2) Test for significant relationships between pectoralis muscle area (PMA), fat-free mass (FFM) and gene expression data in COPD cases; 3) Identify gene expression signatures associated with cachexia and PMA in COPD cases. As part of my K99 analyses, I took advantage of the availability of several well-characterized COPD populations in order to investigate markers of muscle wasting and cachexia such as low PMA and change in BMI. However, the field is in need of investigations focused on cohorts of COPD cases phenotyped for muscle wasting and cachexia. The development of such a cohort is a key focus of the R00 phase of her application (Aim 2) and will lead to pilot data for her first R01 applications.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States.

1K08CA237881-01,Multimodal study of cognitive impairment following radiation therapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) commonly entails the use of radiation
therapy, which often exposes portions of the brain, particularly the cerebellum and inferior temporal lobes, to
moderately high doses of radiation. The negative effects of cranial radiation exposure on cognition are well
established in other types of malignancies, but remain unstudied in LAHNC patients. The underlying disease
process, chemotherapeutic agents, and radiation dose distribution in patients treated for LAHNC are
fundamentally different from the patient populations previously studied, suggesting that patterns of cognitive
impairment may also differ. This scientific proposal will elucidate the cognitive effects of radiation in LAHNC
patients through three specific aims. Scientific Aim 1 will characterize the cognitive profiles of LAHNC survivors
by administering a neuropsychological battery and patient questionnaires. Radiation dosimetry to individual
regions of the cerebellum and temporal lobes will be calculated from the original treatment plans. The effects of
patient and treatment characteristics (including chemotherapy exposure and radiation dosimetry) on post-
treatment cognition will be assessed. Scientific Aim 2 will determine the association between cognitive
impairment and germline variants. Germline single nucleotide polymorphisms will be determined using a
biologically-plausible, carefully curated candidate gene approach and assessed for association with the
neurocognitive battery results. Scientific Aim 3 will explore how modern radiation planning techniques can be
utilized to reduce brain radiation exposure for LAHNC treatment. Comparison radiation plans will be generated
using Multi-Criteria Optimized intensity modulation and proton therapy. This study will promote my long-term
career goal of improving quality of life for patients who received radiation therapy and will provide opportunities
for additional training and career development. The career development plan includes training in biostatistical
and research methodology, normal tissue complication probability modeling, and fundamentals of molecular
epidemiology and cognitive assessment. The scientific and training plans are supported by a team of
experienced mentors and advisors who are committed to the success of this project and my development as a
clinician scientist. The primary mentor is an expert in neurocognitive outcomes among cancer survivors, an
experienced mentor of young investigators, and the director of the UAB Institute for Cancer Outcomes and
Survivorship. The results of this proposal will be utilized to form the foundation of a future clinical trial designed
to reduce cognitive morbidity in LAHNC patients by identifying those patients at highest risk for cognitive
impairment, maximally reducing brain radiation exposure, and implementing a tailored cognitive remediation
intervention. This project will strengthen my skills as a clinical researcher, establish an independent research
platform, and make a true contribution towards improving clinical outcomes in cancer survivors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
More than 80% of the 50,000 patients diagnosed with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) each
year will receive radiation therapy, which can expose portions of the brain to radiation. The overall prognosis
for LAHNC continues to improve due to changing epidemiology and treatment advances, particularly for tumors
of the oropharynx and nasopharynx, resulting in an ever increasing population of LAHNC survivors who are
impacted by late morbidity from their treatment. This study aims to characterize the cognitive effects of
radiation therapy for LAHNC, identify patient and treatment factors that are associated with worse post-
treatment cognition, and explore how modern radiation treatment techniques can be refined to minimize brain
exposure.",2019,253956,235144,18812,Other Research-Related,K08,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases; Rehabilitation,Andrew M McDonald
1R03AG059188-01A1,Longitudinal Biological Pathways Leading to Alzheimer's Disease Health Disparities in Blacks,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blacks are more than twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites. However, controlling for
many of the factors that put Blacks at greater risk, such as having less education and lower
occupational status, does not eliminate these health disparities. Therefore, other race-related
factors underlie the increased risk for dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). One
possibility is that multiple levels of chronic stress found uniquely in Blacks, exacerbate these
health disparities. As outlined by the NIA's Health Disparities Research Framework, these
stressors stem from environmental factors such as residential segregation, sociocultural factors
such as racism, and behavioral factors such as one's perceived control. It is clear that these
types of stressors negatively impact mental health, but a large gap exists between a) these
generalized stressors, b) neurobiological pathways, and c) a diagnosis of AD in Blacks.
Because AD is a brain disease, this knowledge gap can be illuminated by understanding the
biological progression from â€œnormalâ€ to AD in Blacks. According to the neurotoxicity hypothesis,
prolonged exposure to stress increases the brain's vulnerability to pathological toxins and
reduces the brain's ability to resist subtle brain damage. Thus, unique race-related stressors
might lead to a brain environment that is more vulnerable to AD pathology (beta-amyloid and
tau) and accelerates declines in brain structure and the associated cognitive declines that lead
to AD in Blacks compared with Whites. By harmonizing data from the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center and the Minority Aging Research Study, secondary analyses will be
conducted to analyze the biological pathways that create and sustain race-related health
disparities in AD. We will use multi-level model regression techniques to test the extent that 1)
rates of longitudinal declines in cortical thickness will be associated with greater cognitive
decline in Blacks than Whites and 2) rates of longitudinal declines in hippocampal volumes and
a novel measure of hippocampal complexity will be associated with greater cognitive decline in
Blacks than Whites. Addressing whether Blacks are more vulnerable to longitudinal cognitive
decline through different neurodegenerative pathways than Whites would lead to a theoretical
framework that would provide testable hypotheses of causes of these potential vulnerabilities
(like racial stressors).","PROJECT NARRATIVE
We will examine the biological pathways that lead to a two- to four-fold increase in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease in Blacks compared with Whites. This health disparity is a critical public health concern because the
impact on healthcare resources and personal income currently is and will continue to be an enormous burden
on society (an estimated $214 billion), especially in Blacks, who are the least likely to seek out early medical
help, receive adequate treatment, and can afford such treatments. We anticipate that the study would allow us
to define brain vulnerabilities within Blacks that could lead to future interventions that target those brain pathways
with real promise to delay the onset of AD, which would in turn reduce the number of AD cases and costs of
treatment significantly.",2019,71805,50000,21805,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,AL,TUSCALOOSA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,354870104,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Mental Health; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Ian  McDonough
1R21NS111945-01,Rapid modulation of hippocampal GABAergic Inhibition by O-GlcNAcylation,"Hippocampal synaptic function and learning and memory are vulnerable to alterations in protein O-
GlcNAcylation, the O-linked attachment of Î²-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to serine/threonine (ser/thr)
residues. O-GlcNAcylation is now recognized as a possible therapeutic target for cognitive dysfunction,
particularly in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where decreased O-GlcNAc may be permissive for
pathological tau hyperphosphorylation. Systemic administration of the OGA inhibitor, thiamet-G, reversed the
increase in tau phosphorylation and improved spatial learning and memory in transgenic AD mice. Obviously,
determining how O-GlcNAcylation modulates neuronal and synaptic function under physiological and
pathophysiological conditions is imperative to understanding its impact on learning and memory, and the risks
and benefits of therapeutic intervention.
 Our lab has made significant contributions to this new area of research by showing that acute and selective
increase in O-GlcNAcylation of AMPAR GluA2 subunits underlies expression of a novel form of LTD at CA3-
CA1 synapses (O-GlcNAc LTD), as well as the dampening pathological hyperexcitability in seizure models. We
also find that acute increases in O-GlcNAc interferes with some forms of hippocampus-dependent learning and
memory. Because excitation/inhibition balance in memory circuits governs normal learning and memory, and
GABAAR function and trafficking is modified by serine phosphorylation, we have used our expertise to
investigate how rapid changes in O-GlcNAcylation occurring under physiological conditions modulates the
efficacy of GABAergic inhibition. Importantly, because not all GABAergic interneurons express GluA2 subunits,
O-GlcNAc LTD will only occur at glutamatergic synapses on a subset of interneurons, which will alter circuit
dynamics when O-GlcNAcylation is high. In preliminary experiments, we found that acutely increasing protein
O-GlcNAcylation decreases the amplitude and frequency of sIPSCs and the amplitude of mIPSCs recorded
from CA1 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices. In this exploratory proposal, we test the hypothesis that O-
GlcNAcylation directly modulates the strength of synaptic inhibition via postsynaptic GABAARs and receptor
internalization, and indirectly via expression of O-GlcNAc LTD at excitatory synapses onto specific
interneurons possessing GluA2-containing AMPARs. The results of these exploratory studies will establish an
entirely novel fundamental mechanism that directly and indirectly controls GABAergic inhibition, thereby
providing a framework for future studies targeting O-GlcNAc in neurodegenerative diseases, such as
Alzheimer's disease, and in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Down syndrome, where
imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory circuits underlie cognitive dysfunction. The results of these studies will
make a huge advance in a field that is in its infancy.","Inhibitory GABAerigc interneurons mediate proper excitation/inhibition balance in key brain circuits critical for

 This is a new R25 application requesting support for the Neuroscience Roadmap Scholars Program at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Although the number of U.S. citizens from
underrepresented minority (URM) groups earning doctoral degrees in science has increased over the
past decade, URMs continue to represent a small proportion of the scientists in the United States. UAB is
uniquely positioned to support the training of diverse group of trainees. Evidence of this readiness is the
significant (36%) undergraduate enrollment of URM students, predominantly African American, given our
location in the Southeastern US. In addition, UAB is the home for several students with disabilities at the
undergraduate and graduate levels (approximately 400). Importantly, there are several programs already
in place, such as the Office of Equity and Diversity, the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, and the
focus on Neuroscience in the School of Medicine Strategic Plan serve as a firm footing for the
development of a program targeting diversity in Neuroscience. The Comprehensive Neuroscience Center
functions as the epicenter for the Neurosciences on UAB campus and will be the home of the
Neuroscience Roadmap Scholars Program. The CNC has a membership of approximately 365
members, with faculty from 11 basic science and clinical departments from 5 Schools. Since 2010, 89
new faculty have been recruited across several neuroscience-related departments and the number of
students from diverse backgrounds applying to the Neuroscience Theme graduate program represents
27% of the domestic applicant pool in 2014.
 Our proposed Neuroscience Roadmap Scholars Program will target the obstacles impeding
success with the goal of attracting an increased number of diversity trainees to neuroscience research
and providing them with the necessary tools and skills early in their PhD careers which are essential to

5P30DK079337-12,Core A - Resource for Clinical Studies of AKI,"Project Summary
 Clinical and translational research in acute kidney injury (AKI) requires access to well characterized
patients with longitudinal follow up coupled with biological samples enabling investigators to probe the
underlying mechanisms and pathways contributing to outcomes. The specific aims of the Resource for Clinical
Studies of AKI (Core A) are to (i) facilitate and support the design and conduct of clinical research in AKI with
appropriate tools to collect and record information for detailed phenotypic characterization of patients through
the course of AKI, (ii) provide access to comprehensive datasets of well characterized patients with and
without AKI, and (iii) provide a biological sample repository that includes human kidney tissue, blood and urine,
linked to an accessible clinical database of patients with and without AKI to enable translational research
studies. This core will specifically provide investigators access to patients with AKI through an established
international network of collaborating investigators who are contributing to an ongoing registry of AKI in the ICU
setting currently with over 2,200 patients. Core A is designed to facilitate both hypothesis-driven and
hypothesis-generating clinical research by providing essential resources for clinical investigation and
enhancing interactions with a large worldwide network of investigators and centers focused on AKI.
 Since its inception the Core has been very successful in supporting investigators for clinical and
translational research. We have established a robust data management system and database of patients with
AKI that is flexible in accommodating the research objectives of individual investigators and collaborating
centers. A new service being offered by Core A is the addition of human kidney tissues along with biological
samples (blood, urine and DNA) from patients with and without AKI and healthy controls. Over the last 4 years,
Core A has been highly productive in assisting multiple facets of clinical research supporting 72 investigators
including 8 pilot and catalyst awardees and 111 different projects. These combined efforts have resulted in 40
peer-reviewed publications. All services provided by Core A are being utilized by our investigator base. We
envision that these rich resources will continue to enable interdisciplinary clinical investigation in AKI to
advance our understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of human AKI. We are confident that
Core A in conjunction with the existing resources at UAB and UCSD and other cores within the O'Brien Center
will accelerate the translation of new investigative insights towards improving outcomes for patients with AKI.",,2019,298464,294630,3834,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Clinical Research; Kidney Disease,Ravindra L.

5R21AT009908-02,"B-vitamins and NAD mechanism, or when vitamin B3's bioavailability is not enough.","Abstract:
 Vitamin B3 (niacin) in its functional cofactor forms is found as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
(phosphate) and reduced forms (referred as NAD(P)(H)). These cofactors participate in more reactions than
any other known vitamin-derived molecules and are intimately implicated in essential bioenergetics, anabolic
and catabolic pathways. Through its roles in mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS), reactive oxygen species
(ROS) inhibition and additional roles in cellular signalling, the NAD(P)(H) metabolome is central to cellular
homeostasis and growth. Acute vitamin B3 deficiency leads to pellagra, a debilitating and deadly disease still
endemic in some regions of the world, even in affluent populations. In the US, clinical vitamin B3 deficiency is
due to poor food choices, adverse drug reactions, alcoholism and infectious or autoimmune diseases.
Sustained sub-optimal dietary intake of vitamin B3 has been shown to have long term physiological
consequences, while health benefits associated with vitamin B3 supplementation remain poorly understood.
Critically, excessive food intake changes vitamin B3 metabolism and the bioavailability of its functional
cofactors, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular impairment, mainly impacting organs with high
metabolic turnover such as liver, kidneys, brain and heart. Often overlooked is that vitamin B3's bioconversion
to its functional cofactors depends on the bioavailability of other dietary vitamin Bs' derivatives, in particular
thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2).
 We hypothesize that a deficiency, even partial, in vitamin B1 and B2 will negatively impact the
bioavailability of the vitamin B3's functional forms, even in time of vitamin B3 supplementation, leading to
adverse physiological outcomes. We propose to measure and compare the effects that changes in the
bioavailability of the functional forms of vitamin B1 and B2, have on the NAD(P)(H) metabolome. Using our
synthetic expertise in nucleotide and stable isotope labelling chemistry, we will generate isotopically labelled
biosynthetic precursors and intermediates to examine the synergism between the bioavailability of these three
vitamins' cofactors and mitochondrial functions under different controlled supplementation conditions in human
liver and kidney cells. Further, we will determine if cells compensate for an NAD+ shortage imposed by vitamin
B1 and B2 biosynthetic temporary deficiencies by directly generating NAD+ through the Nicotinamide Riboside
dependent NAD+ biosynthetic pathway to extend/ resume mitochondrial function. This knowledge will support
our long-term goal of identifying new, physiologically relevant vitamin-B combinations which better restore
mitochondrial function in cells and organs, where metabolism has been compromised by imbalanced
micronutrition. This knowledge will also improve our understanding of the impacts of a global or partial vitamin
B deficiency and vitamin B supplementation on organ's functions in relation to malnutrition and over-nutrition.","Narrative
Vitamin B3 supplementation induces some beneficial physiological changes in metabolic conditions linked to
high calorie/high fat diet and sedentary life styles; however, the impact of vitamins B1 and B2 and their
abundance on the efficacy of vitamin B3 supplementation has never been considered. Here, we combine
chemical tools and biological methods to measure intracellular changes in the active forms of these B
vitamins and correlate these measurements to cellular function. This knowledge will help identify new,
physiologically relevant, vitamin B combinations that could better restore cellular function in organs where
metabolism has been compromised by imbalanced nutrition and be particularly important in terms of
understanding the impacts of a global or partial vitamin B deficiency in relation to malnutrition and over-
nutrition.",2019,192500,125000,67500,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,366880002,Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition,Marie Eugenie Migaud

7R01CA204136-04,Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development,"ABSTRACT
Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However,
targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in
glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse
(GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have
prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non-
germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and
chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft
(PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor
beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en
masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this
Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models
against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from
distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will
develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that
will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM
models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and
drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to
develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically-
defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro-
oncology.","Public Health Relevance Statement

5K22HL131694-02,Functional Role of Myeloid Progenitor Cells in Obesity-Associated Airway Inflammation,"Project Summary and Abstract (Description)
The major theme of the proposed research centers on how obesity contributes to the proliferation
and differentiation of dendritic cell (DC)-restricted common DC progenitor cells (CDPs) for
developing airway inflammation. The hypothesis is based on that obesity exacerbates airway
inflammation in asthma by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of CDPs in the BM, which
enhances the ability of DCs in the lung to promote adaptive immune responses. A specific
objective of the research in the proposal is to identify novel endogenous signaling pathways and
druggable targets in CDPs related to adaptive immunity that regulates airway inflammation in
obesity. The proposal will utilize synergistic combination of murine models of experimental obesity-
induced airway inflammation and cellular investigations of immune and progenitor cell functions.
 The first Aim will employ the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr) knock-out (VLDLr-
/-) mice to determine the role in CDP proliferation and differentiation. In particular, the influence of
VLDLr in cell cycle regulation and CDP proliferation will be evaluated. The hypothesis that VLDLr
negatively regulates proliferation and differentiation of CDPs can be quantitatively tested by bone
marrow transfer (BMT) experiments using VLDLr-/- mice. Understanding the role of VLDLr in DC-
restricted progenitor cells will be essential for studying myelopoiesis in diet-induced obesity.
 The second aim develops the therapeutic strategy that includes targeting the VLDLr with an
apolipoprotein E (apoE)-mimetic peptide to block CDP proliferation and differentiation. VLDLr are
receptor for apoE and targeting progenitor cells with an apoE mimetic peptide will be suggestive of
a druggable target for blocking the pathways of myelopoiesis in obesity.
 The third aim uses novel signaling pathways on DC-restricted progenitor cell differentiation
during obesity associated airway inflammation (OAI). The hypothesis that obesity promotes p38
MAPK signaling pathways and regulates DC differentiation and airway inflammation can be
quantitatively tested using p38 mutant mice that specifically show attenuated p38 MAPK signaling.
Establishing the substrates and transcription factors of p38 MAPK signaling will be crucial for DC
differentiation in OAI.
 The candidate is currently a research fellow at NHLBI in the Laboratory of Asthma and Lung
Inflammation. The proposal describes a combined research and training program leading to
independence. During the mentored phase of this project the candidate will continue training in
BMT, flow cytometry and stem/progenitor cell assay techniques, as well as develop other skills
necessary for a successful academic career. A list of leaders in the fields of asthma and lung
inflammation, lipoprotein signaling, stem and progenitor cell proliferation, flow cytometry working at
the NIH have agreed to provide this training through frequent lab visits that includes: Dr. Stewart J.
Levine (candidate's mentor; Asthma and Lung inflammation); Dr. Alan T. Remaley (Obesity and
Lipoprotein Metabolism); Dr. J. Philip McCoy (Flow cytometry); Dr. Cynthia Dunbar (Stem cell and
hematopoiesis).
 In addition to the research-related training, the candidate will take a number of training
courses at the NIH, focusing on grant-writing, leadership skills, management skills, and teaching.","Project Narrative
As the incidence of obesity-associated diseases continues to rise at a staggering rate, the need for a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate metabolic-immunological crosstalk during obesity
has risen to the forefront of biomedical investigation. Obesity is a proven risk factor for allergic airway
diseases-such as asthma. Asthma severity appears to be increased in the obese and alters the response to
controller therapy leading to greater healthcare utilization and a reduced quality of life. Various mechanism
accounts for unravelling the intricacies of obesity-induced or obesity-exacerbated asthma. However, our
current knowledge on how myeloid progenitor cells and dendritic cell subsets modulate inflammation and the
development of asthma in obesity is limited. This proposal will investigate novel endogenous lipoprotein

Effective mentorship is essential to improving the success of trainees from diverse backgrounds, including those
from under-represented (UR) groups in the biomedical sciences, from undergraduates to new professionals. The
overarching objectives of this proposal are to test: 1) the effects of pre-existing social and contextual factors
on participation of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in biomedical workforce, 2) test
whether mentoring/networking intervention, mainly in freshmen and sophomore years, influence the
persistence, engagement, and development of science identity of students from diverse backgrounds. Our
proposal will focus on a set of HBCUs that are geographically distributed with different individual- and
neighborhood- level socioeconomic factors. Based on historical data and background, we hypothesize that the
preexisting social and contextual capital factors among diverse students mediates the persistence, engagement
and overall success rate of students as an individual and as a group. This hypothesis will be tested in following
specific aims: Specific aim 1: Determine the effects of active intervention through mentoring and networking
on engagement and success of students â€“ immediate post-intervention effects for freshmen and distal effects for
sophomore and higher-level students. Specific aim 2: Determine the role personal and contextual factors play in
the engagement and success of freshmen and sophomore and higher-level students. Specific aim 3: Determine
whether the immediate post-intervention engagement and success of freshmen mediate the effect of active
intervention through mentoring and networking on distal engagement and success of the students as sophomores
and higher-level. This project relies on a mixed experimental design with random selection and assignment of
participants to Active Intervention (test) and Control Intervention (control) groups. Pre-/Post-test data will be
gathered in each cycle of participation, with ongoing monitoring of engagement with the intervention activities.
Differences between groups will be minimized through the use of a small number of similar institutions,
drawing both treatment and control groups from each institution, as well as examining the effect of various
contextual factors, including social capital on group differences. Our test group will be freshmen who will
participate in the mentoring and networking programs of NRMN, and in addition get active intervention at the
institution through near-peer mentoring, peer mentoring, mentee training and coaching. The control group will
be freshmen who participate in mentoring and networking programs of NRMN, but do not get active
intervention. The comparison group will be all freshmen who did not participate in NRMN (institutional data).
Our expected outcome of the interventions is increased persistence, engagement and science identity of the test
group resulting in the successful transition to the next career stage. Our outcome measures are consistent with
the DPC Hallmarks of Success. Based on baseline data from participating institutions, we will set an expected
target for our outcomes. Outcomes from our studies will lead to a predictive model that can be translated to
persistence and career transition of AA students in other HBCUs and majority institutions.","Project Narrative

5K01DK106284-04,Monocyte Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Kidney Stone Disease,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Approximately 9% of the United States population will develop a kidney stone in their lifetime. Lifestyle
factors, genetics, and diet all contribute to the development of kidney stones. The most common type of kidney
stone is comprised of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. Research on kidney stones is hampered by limited
access to kidney cells and tissue from patients. Very few studies have focused on circulating immune cells
which may play a role in disease processes. Monocytes/macrophages are essential for crystal clearance and
are recruited to the renal interstitium. We recently determined that monocytes but not lymphocytes or platelets
have lower mitochondrial function in patients with CaOx kidney stones compared to healthy subjects. The
objective of the current proposal is to evaluate for changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and
inflammatory responses in circulating monocytes and plasma from a large cohort of patients with CaOx kidney
stones and healthy subjects. This may identify specific responses associated with this disease. The central
hypothesis of the current proposal is circulating monocytes in patients with CaOx kidney stones develop
mitochondrial dysfunction due to cellular events mediated by CaOx stones and/or exposure to CaOx crystals in
the nephron. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine whether
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are associated with circulating monocyte
subtypes in patients with CaOx kidney stones; 2) Elucidate whether cytokines or CaOx crystals induce NLRP3
inflammasome pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction in primary monocytes and a human derived monocyte
cell line; and 3) Determine whether a dietary oxalate load that produces urinary CaOx crystals in healthy
subjects causes similar monocyte responses to those observed in patients. The proposed studies may provide
new insights regarding the role of monocyte function and inflammation in CaOx kidney stone disease. This
research plan will allow the applicant to gain additional experience in kidney stone disease and clinical
research plus training in mass spectrometry, renal pathophysiology, immunology, and biostatistics through
practical experience, course work, and guidance from an experienced mentoring team. It will also advance and
facilitate the success of the applicant to transition into becoming an independent and productive NIH-funded
investigator focused on monocytes and kidney stone disease.","Project Narrative

5R33ES025662-04,RT-SQuARED-M method to study the precise role of mitochondria in the oxidative damage caused by environmental toxins,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of intracellular signaling is demonstrated in the crosstalk between various signaling pathways and in their regulation by the ubiquitous analytes, such as ATP, ROS and cell metabolites, with mitochondria at the center stage. Thus, it is critical to monitor real-time activities of mitochondria to fully understand ther impact on cell signaling. Here, this team proposes to investigate if and how mitochondrial fission/fusion events, collectively called mtDynamics, modulate signaling events during environmental carcinogenesis by regulating mitochondrial ROS production in real time. To investigate such a precise role of mitochondria, we propose to develop a quantitative microscopy-based analytical method of Real Time Simultaneous Quantitative Assessment of the Redox Environment and Dynamics of Mitochondria (RT- SQuARED-M). In the R21 phase the performance of the RT-SQuARED-M method will be further developed and validated. After meeting the set R21 milestone, a broader scientific hypothesis in the R33 phase will be tested. The pioneering studies and new preliminary data demonstrate that repression of mtFission, which allows for unopposed mtFusion and repressed mitophagy, leads to a) increased cell proliferation, b) enhanced mtROS production from hotspots, and c) non-canonical recruitment of crucial cell cycle regulators on mitochondria. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that carcinogenicity caused by oxidative damage-inducing environmental polyhydrocarbons is initiated as mtDynamics-driven local mtROS modulates distinct mitochondrial sites for signaling and mitophagy. Using the RT-SQuARED-M method, we anticipate discovering 1) lower mtROS at the DRP1-driven mtFission sites define the mitophagic hotspots, while the higher mtROS at the MFN1/2-driven mtFusion sites define the signaling hotspots; 2) polyhydrocarbon carcinogens B[a]P and TCDD lower Drp1 driven-mtFission to repress mitophagic clearance and allow aberrant mtROS-based growth factor-cell cycle signaling in mitochondria to initiate lung and skin carcinogenesis. Discovery of such precise mitochondrial signaling that could be modulated by environmental carcinogens would be a paradigm shift in the role of mitochondria in environmental toxicity. This study, if successful, will reveal the mechanism of action behind the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics in lung and skin carcinogenesis and highlight key mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins (Drp1 and/or Mfn1/2) as potential targets for preventing initiation of lung and skin carcinogenesis. The proposed research team has expertise in all the methods and procedures required for successful development and application of the innovative RT- SQuARED-M method in understanding carcinogenesis of the lung and skin.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung and skin cancers are primarily caused by various environmental pollutants through a process called carcinogenesis. Here, the intent is to understand how specific environmental pollutants cause carcinogenesis by altering the properties of mitochondria that are components of the cell mostly known for energy production. A new method is developed for studying how environmental pollutants impact mitochondrial function in real-time. This method will be applied to study how carcinogens impact mitochondrial function to initiate tumor formation during lung and skin carcinogenesis. It is believed that these
studies will reveal a new role of mitochondria in carcinogenesis and will identify new potential ways for therapeutic prevention of environmental carcinogenesis.",2019,551248,371211,180037,Non-SBIR/STTR,R33,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Lung; Lung Cancer,Kasturi  Mitra

1F31HL151264-01,Novel Endothelial and Immunologic Mechanisms of Pathophysiology in Sickle Cell Disease,"Project Summary
Sickle cell disease was first identified in the US in 1910 and the first treatment was not proposed until the 1980â€™s.
It is the first identified single gene causative disease and is the most common inherited blood disorder in the US.
It presents when individuals inherit two mutant beta globin genes, one from each parent. Kidney disease is found
in a large number of patients with sickle cell disease (sickle cell nephropathy) and can progress to death rapidly.
Elevated levels of the peptide endothelin 1 and dysregulated immune function have been shown to play a major
role in the development of sickle cell nephropathy, However, the cell source for the peptide and immune cell type
by which this occurs is poorly misunderstood. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that, within the
kidney, sickle cell disease promotes endothelial-specific endothelin 1 expression and TH17-mediated damage,
leading to renal injury, dysfunction and overall nephropathy. To study the contribution of endothelial-derived
endothelin 1, we successfully developed an endothelial-specific endothelin 1 knockout mouse model on the
Townes humanized sickle cell mouse background. These animals will be studied rigorously in order to evaluate
markers of renal injury and dysfunction, and will undergo studies to determine pathophysiological hallmarks of
disease progression. To determine the innovative role of TH17 cells in sickle cell nephropathy, humanized mice
will undergo flow cytometric and histopathologic analysis to determine temporal relationship between disease
progression and immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, using established adoptive transfer experiments, SCD
mice will have in vitro polarized TH17 cells from TH17 reporter mice transferred into them at a young age to
evaluate the contribution long-term to sickle cell nephropathy. Finally, we will also evaluate whether endothelial-
derived endothelin 1 has a role in the recent observation that SCD mice have elevated intrarenal TH17 cells.
These two innovative approaches will seek to provide novel pathways by which to better target sickle cell
nephropathy and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease.","Project Narrative
Sickle cell nephropathy is a major complication in patients with sickle cell disease and contributes significantly
to death in this population. Elevated endothelin 1 and endothelin receptor A signaling, as well as immune
dysfunction, play an important role in the development of sickle cell nephropathy. The proposed study will

ABSTRACT
The Human Imaging Shared Facility (HISF) enhances imaging-related research activities included in the UAB-
CCC's collaborative group portfolio and other clinical trials through the provision of a standardized approach for
reviews of each UAB-CCC protocol and coordination of non-routine imaging services. The protocol review is
performed by two research imaging coordinators who provide quotes for routine and nonroutine research
imaging services in compliance with institutional and national regulations. Other HISF services include image
data transfers and protocol specific imaging techniques, phantom scan/site qualification imaging, physicist,
radiologist, or radiology technologist time, and procurement of information for image data forms. Image data
transfers meet all UAB Health System Information Security (HSIS) requirements and are audited periodically
by the UAB HSIS. Accurate and timely analysis of conventional imaging studies used for response assessment
in cancer clinical trials makes up the bulk of services provided to members of the UAB-CCC. With dedicated
subspecialty faculty radiologist interpretations coordinated by the assistance of the two radiology research
imaging coordinators and a metrics coordinator, protocol-specific metrics are generated by the same set of
designated readers throughout the course of each therapeutic trial for consistent longitudinal metrics reporting.
In cases of adjudication, the HISF Director works with the PIs and coordinators to resolve reporting issues.
The HISF promotes the development and incorporation of novel response evaluation methods (imaging
biomarkers) for cancer preclinical, translational, and Phase I-III clinical trials. Through scientific collaboration
the HISF can facilitate the translation of more sophisticated imaging examinations, image analytics, and
metrics utilized by the other imaging cores such as the Preclinical Imaging Shared Facility and Comprehensive
Core for Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Analysis and Development. These non-standard advanced image
analyses include physiologic MRI (diffusion weighted imaging, dynamic contrast MRI, MR Spectroscopy),
investigational PET CT, PET MRI, and Spectral (dual energy) MDCT. Both standard metrics and advanced

5P2CHD086851-05,High-Impact Trials Center: Techniques Development Component,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Recent technological advances have initiated a booming new field of biosensors, wearable devices, and 
smartphone apps for monitoring physiological responses, movement patterns, step counts, caloric expenditure, 
dietary intake calorie counts, and personal health information. Usage of these tools â€“ in many cases for goal- 
setting (e.g., â€œ10,000 steps per dayâ€) â€“ is growing at a rapid pace among children and adults of all ages. In 
parallel, there is an ever-heightening interest in applying these technologies to biomedical research. A 
particularly attractive research application for medical rehabilitation researchers is the potential for more 
rigorous home-based or community-based interventional research; enabling the collection of physiological or 
other useful data with relative ease. Such technologies would empower researchers conducting T2-T3 
research, and provide underserved persons with disabilities or chronic conditions more opportunities to 
participate in clinical trials or other home-based interventional studies. However, a major problem facing the 
medical rehabilitation field is a lack of validity and reliability testing of these devices. Therefore, the central 
goal of the Techniques Development Component (Tech-C) of the P2C National Resource Center for High- 
Impact Clinical Trials in Medical Rehabilitation is to fill a major gap in the field that will catalyze more rigorous, 
home-based medical rehabilitation clinical trials. We will achieve this goal by providing a HITC Validation 
Laboratory to the national community of medical rehabilitation researchers to evaluate the validity and 
reliability of novel and existing tools and technology used for remote data collection in clinical trials. Building on 
our own experiences, the HITC Validation Laboratory will provide the resources and expertise to assist 
researchers in their pursuit of useful, home-based monitoring and intervention technologies. Our central goal 
will be achieved via the following specific aims: Aim 1. We will conduct a nationwide needs assessment in 
collaboration with the CCIT and Promo-C. Aim 2. By surveying the national user base of medical rehabilitation 
researchers (again in collaboration with the CCIT and Promo-C), we will work with investigators to obtain 
currently available, de-identified datasets for analysis, and to help guide (via consultative services in 
collaboration with Collab-C) the development of short-term, multi-site pilot studies that would generate new 
datasets for validation by the HITC Validation Laboratory. Aim 3. In collaboration with industry partners, other 
P2C resource centers, and investigators across the national HITC user base, we will conduct in-house 
validation studies of the most common, commercially available wearable and biosensor devices. By achieving 
these aims, the HITC Validation Laboratory will meet a significant and growing need for the medical 
rehabilitation research community.

5P50AR060772-08,Project 3: Translational Genomics of Hyperuricemia,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with hyperuricemia (HU) and gout; however, the causal 
relationship is unclear. Of >30 urate genes identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), ten are 
also associated with CKD. Genetic variation in urate transporters (e.g., SLC2A9, encoding the GLUT9 
transporter) has been implicated in HU and gout; however, exact causal genes and their mechanisms are 
unclear. The regulatory effects on GLUT9 and other urate transporters and signaling networks associated with 
HU and CKD are highly relevant to understanding the functional genomics of HU and its causality with CKD. 
Furthermore, APOL1 protein, linked to the genetic risk of CKD in African Americans, is co-expressed with 
GLUT9, and our data suggest an association of APOL1 genotype on serum urate (sUA).Our goal is to fill these 
key knowledge gaps by unraveling the molecular relationship between HU and CKD. To achieve this, we 
propose key translational genetic and functional studies, using cutting-edge translational physiology 
and genetics. In Aim 1 we will screen and characterize regulatory proteins (including APOL1) implicated in both 
HU and CKD to identify functional interactions with urate transport. To accomplish this we will first examine the 
effects on urate transport in co-expression with GLUT9 and other urate transporters in Xenopus oocytes. This 
approach has already revealed novel physiology for the digenic TMEM171/174 locus, with inhibition of 
basolateral GLUT9 by TMEM171 and of apical URAT1 transport by TMEM174. Multiple resequencing resources 
will be screened for uncommon penetrant coding variants in these regulatory genes, segregating with extremes 
in sUA; functional effects of these variants will then be characterized. In Aim 2 we propose state-of-the-art 
genetic approaches using very large, publicly available data sets to discover the causality and shared genetic 
etiology of HU and CKD. To determine the relative importance of shared genetic and/or environmental 
contributions to HU and CKD, we will quantify directly the genome-wide marker-based genetic and environmental 
correlation between sUA and eGFR/CKD using multivariate Bayesian whole genome regression (WGR). To 
ascertain specific genes and pathways jointly contributing to HU and eGFR/CKD we will estimate the genetic 
correlation in genomic regions using WGR. We will investigate a causal role of urate-raising genetic variants in 
reduced renal function; this will be formally tested by Mendelian randomization. Finally, there is a major unmet 
need for a genetically tractable model of human urate homeostasis. Our group has shown that human stem-cell- 
derived kidney cells self-organize into human kidney organoids that functionally recapitulate tissue-specific 
epithelial physiology. In Aim 3 we will utilize this system to study CKD- and HU-associated genes, first analyzing 
the role of a regulatory SNP in the TMEM171/174 locus and the individual roles of TMEM171 and TMEM174 in 
renal tubular urate physiology. Completion of the project will yield novel tools for translational urate research and 
novel insight into shared pathways in CKD and HU, suitable for therapeutic targeting.",,2019,338641,332392,6249,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Kidney Disease; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Human; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human,David Bruce Mount
5R01AI134023-02,B cell intrinsic interferon-beta regulates autoreactive B cell development,"Project Summary/Abstract
A considerable body of evidence implicates type I interferons (IFNs) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE);
however, the â€œinterferon signatureâ€ does not address the source and the key pathogenic type I IFNs in SLE,
making it challenging to design effective precision medicine for SLE. We propose the novel hypothesis that it is
the endogenous production of IFNÎ² by B cells that plays a defining role in shaping the autoantibody response
and disease activity in a substantial subset of patients with SLE. We have found, in humans and mice, that the
transitional (Tr) stage of B-cell development is characterized by heterogeneity in IFNÎ² expression at the single-
cell level. Our preliminary data further suggest that: (i) Tr B cells with high endogenous production of IFNÎ²
undergo strong IFNÎ² autocrine signaling and changes in the transcriptome signature in a manner that supports
RNA/RNP-associated TLR7 responses. This imprinted signature promotes subsequent survival and
development of RNP-reactive B cells including their differentiation into long-lived memory B cells; and (ii) Anti-
dsDNA autoAb producing cells are derived from Tr cells that do not express high levels of endogenous IFNÎ²
expression; however, high levels of endogenous IFNÎ² in memory B cells play a critical role in the differentiation
of short-lived anti-dsDNA memory B cells. The model is supported by compelling preliminary data including
analyses of PBMCs from SLE patients that indicated significantly higher IFNÎ² expression in B cells from SLE
patients with renal involvement and significantly higher expression of intracellular IFNÎ² in B cells from female
African-American (AA) SLE patients as compared with non-AA patients and healthy controls. In Aim 1, we will
establish if lupus flare is associated with increases in IFNÎ²hi memory B cells and if this phenotype is more
common in AA SLE patients. High-throughput single-cell transcriptome analysis coupled with state-of-the-art
computational analysis will be used to identify transcriptional signatures in DNA- and RNA-reactive B cells to
refine this marker; to establish if, as predicted, there is commonality between the RNP-reactive Tr and memory
B cell transcriptome; and to identify the association of enhanced IFNÎ² signaling with stage-specific
dysregulation of downstream pathways. Functional and target-specific analysis of sorted human PBMCs will
then be used to determine if endogenous B-cell IFNÎ² and its downstream pathways are essential for RNA- vs
DNA-ligand mediated Tr and memory B-cell activation and survival. In Aim 2, we will use the same
approaches in the BXD2 lupus model and BCR transgenic mice to determine if endogenous IFNÎ² is essential
for, and differentially regulates, anti-RNP and anti-DNA B cell development in vivo. This hypothetical model
does not negate the contributions of other cells and factors to the pathogenesis of SLE but reframes the
current paradigm. The data generated will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of SLE, identify novel
therapeutic targets and provide the basis for development of precision medicine-guided approaches to
utilization of currently available therapies in a significant subset of patients.","Project Narrative
In the proposed work, we have identified a cascade of well-orchestrated interactions between interferon beta
(IFNÎ²) and several downstream key immune mediating molecules that act together to delineate the
development and survival of short-lived versus long-lived autoreactive B cells. We will use state-of-the-art
technologies to identify the key signatures of IFNÎ²-dependent versus IFNÎ²-independent mechanisms that
enable autoreactive B-cell development in both human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) subjects and
mouse models of lupus. The proposed work exhibits the potential to assist the development of precision
medicine for SLE.",2019,487058,327985,159073,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Genetics; Lupus; Precision Medicine,John D Mountz
5I01BX004049-02,Interferon Beta Initiated Development of Immunogenic T1 B cells in Lupus,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic debilitating disease that is characterized by high titers of
autoantibodies with specificity for nuclear autoantigens. It is considered to arise from interactions between
underlying genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with different combinations resulting in inter-
individual variations in disease manifestations and therapeutic responsiveness. Directed therapeutic targeting
of specific pathways has not proven effective, which suggests that the current understanding of pathogenesis
is incomplete. The goal of the proposed project is to test the hypothesis that the survival of immature
autoreactive B cells, the preferential development of antinuclear autoreactive B cells and the status of mature
autoreactive B cells (immunocompetent vs. anergic/tolerogenic) is decided during the transitional stage 1 (T1)
of development and requires constitutive T1 B cell expression of interferon Î² (IFNÎ²).
 This paradigm shifting hypothesis is based on data generated using a combination of mixed-bone marrow
chimeras, flow cytometry with tetramer or idiotype antibody selection, and high-throughput single-cell analysis
to interrogate type I interferon (IFN) networks in B cell from patients with SLE and lupus-prone BXD2 mice. The
data suggest that the currently known molecular and cellular aberrations are preceded by a single primary
pathogenic event, i.e., production of IFNÎ² by T1 B cells. The data suggest that the survival of the very early T1
cells is dependent on endogenous expression of IFNÎ². This subset of T1 B cells express endogenous IFNÎ²,
which leads to their development into T1 B cells that produce IFNÎ±. The ability of T1 B cells to escape negative
B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated selection is dictated by the type I IFN-determined responsiveness of this T1
subset to BCR-mediated signaling in combination with stimulation of TLR signaling (TLR7 or TLR9) by
apoptotic debris. This preferentially permits escape of nucleic antigen-autoreactive B cells. We have further
identified that the T1 B cell compartment contains distinct subsets of cells. As these included subsets with
transcriptional profiles that parallel the phenotypes of mature and anergic suppressive regulatory (Breg) cells
and their immunogenic counterparts that predominate in SLE, our new data suggest that this phenotypic switch
in the mature B cells is imprinted during the T1 stage. These data also suggest that development of type I IFN
network associated T1 B cells in BXD2 mice is associated with type I IFN-inducing transcription factors (IRF3
and IRF7) whereas induction of the Foxp3+ regulatory T1 B cells is associated with transcription factor, ID3.
 Notably, these data not only suggest suppression of precursors of T1-Breg is a novel pathogenic
framework in SLE but also provide the tool, i.e., the gene expression signatures in sorted transitional B cells,
that enable its analysis. We will test the critical elements of our overall hypothesis through three Specific Aims
that will: (1) Distinguish the roles of the constitutive IFNÎ² signaling and the microenvironmental signals in
driving the development of T1 B cells; (2) Identify if the initial T1 B cell transcriptional imprinting is maintained
at the T2/MZP-MZ-FO stage of development; and (3) Determine if T1 B-cell endogenous IFNÎ² promotes a type
I IFN network that suppresses the precursors of regulatory B cells at the T1 stage in SLE patients. The
scientific premises of the proposed work include the parallels between transcriptional profiles in the T1 B cells
and mature B cells and the segregation of type I IFN associated vs Breg associated transcriptional profiles in
the T1 B cells. We have acquired reporter mouse strains for IFNÎ², IL-10, Foxp3 and Id3 to interrogate discreet
developmental stages within and derived from transitional T1 B subsets.
 The information gained will have a broad-based impact on the field and improve the care of VA patients
with SLE by identifying strategies to improve the efficacy of targeted biologic therapies together with non-
invasive precision medicine guided-approaches.","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating autoimmune disease that is characterized by high
autoantibody titers and elevated type I interferon (IFN) responses. Our use of powerful new techniques,
including single cell gene expression analysis, has generated data indicating that intrinsically elevated
IFNÎ² production by early immature B cells imprints altered responses to IFNÎ± signaling on the maturing B
cells. This both promotes escape of autoreactive cells from normal deletion process and shifts
development of suppressive regulatory B cells toward a proinflammatory phenotype. This paradigm
shifting hypothesis will be tested using advanced in vivo and in vitro techniques to distinguish the roles of
intrinsic B cell defects and environmental signals; test the proposed imprinting of the maturing B cells and
its effects on tolerance induction and maintenance; and test if the intrinsic or imprinted B cell defects
correspond to disease activity and therapeutic responsiveness in SLE patients at the BVAMC.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,John D Mountz
5P30DK074038-15,The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Therapeutic and Screening Resource: Core D,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is no FDA-approved therapy for any form of HRFDs. However, molecular pathways highly relevant to
pathobiology of several specific HRFD have recently been identified. This raises hope that pharmacological
targeting of druggable components of these pathways may attenuate HRFD progression. Since similar level of
disease knowledge triggered identification of FDA-approved treatments for other inherited disorders (e.g.,
cystic fibrosis), we believe that comparable success can be achieved for at least some forms of HRFD. To help
facilitate this goal, we have established the Therapeutics Development and Screening Resource (Core D) to
provide essential tools, models and technologies, along with an integrated plan for their use in lead compound
optimization and preclinical development.
 Specifically, (i) to address lack of predictive in vitro assays that can be used to identify and characterize
HRFD lead compounds, Core D will develop a tractable model for lead compound identification consisting of a
well characterized panel of cell lines with known HRFD mutations. Coupling of such cell-based resource with
HRFD relevant reporter assays offers innovative and robust tool for identification of HRFD lead compounds
and for characterization of functional HRFD protein domains that are potentially targeted with a single drug. (ii)
To improve assessment of drug efficacy, Core D will develop in vivo predictive models for standardized
longitudinal monitoring of drug effects in animal HRFD models using established and newly developed markers
of the disease progression. (iii) To enhance preclinical safety assessment of prioritized drugs, Core D will
develop HRFD-specific toxicology and safety screens.
 In summary, to advance development of HRFD therapeutics, Core D will establish innovative drug
discovery and standardized drug efficacy screening systems. These newly developed resources will be made
available to the HRFD Core Center Investigator Base to advance discovery and evaluation of new HRFD
therapeutics. In addition, a standardized strategy for drug efficacy testing in HRFD models will help to solidify
emerging hypotheses by providing cost-effective in vivo evaluation of specific HRFD progression modulating
effects. Therefore, we anticipate that Core D will also catalyze development of HRFD therapeutics indirectly by
attracting additional funding to HRFD research by enhancing quality of HRFD grants and manuscripts and by
attracting new non-HRFD investigators to this field.

5U54MD000502-17,"Project 1: Early Life Stress, DNA Methylation, and Disparities in Obesity across Generations","Compared to Whites, Blacks carry a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and early mortality.
These health disparities have been linked with high levels of psychosocial stress experienced by Blacks
(e.g., poverty, interpersonal violence), but the biological mechanisms linking psychosocial stress with
health disparities remain poorly understood. Similarly, the extent to which multi-level protective factors
(e.g., from individual, interpersonal, and community domains) mitigate the effects of early life stress on
health outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms is unknown. This proposal will investigate the
hypothesis that early life stress (before age 20) produces DNA methylation profiles that contribute to
health disparities in obesity-related outcomes and are transmitted across generations, but can be
mitigated by protective factors from individual, interpersonal, and community domains. To achieve the
goals of this project, we will capitalize on an existing longitudinal study, the Birmingham Youth Violence
Study, which collected prospective, multi-informant data on a variety of early life stressors and protective
factors in over 500 individuals (78% Black, 22% White, 50% female) in Birmingham, Alabama,
longitudinally at average ages 11, 13 and 19. This project will conduct a follow up assessment on 400
young adults from this cohort (average age 26) and 200 of their offspring (ages 0 to 5). It will involve a
comprehensive evaluation of obesity and related biomarkers (blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin,
inflammation markers) in the young adults; assessment of obesity and history of early life stress in the
offspring; and collection and analyses of salivary DNA from both the young adults and their offspring.
The combined data will be used to 1) identify DNA methylation variations that are associated with early
life stress and obesity in young adulthood; 2) identify multi-level protective factors that attenuate the
associations of early life stress with DNA methylation and obesity; and 3) characterize the extent to
which stress-related DNA methylation patterns transmit across generations and contribute to offspring
obesity. The findings of this study will provide novel insights into stress-related epigenetic mechanisms
that may explain racial health disparities and their transmission across generations, as well as multi-level
protective factors that may interrupt the perpetuation of biologically embedded adversity across
generations. Better understanding of these processes may lead to development of epigenetic biomarkers
for early diagnosis of disease, ability to identify susceptible individuals at risk for adult disease, and
development of novel preventive and curative measures that would reduce health disparities.",,2019,214330,281819,125090,Research Centers,U54,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Childhood Obesity; Clinical Research; Genetics; Mental Health; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Prevention; Violence Research; Youth Violence,Sylvie  Mrug
5P01CA210946-03,Project 2: Design and Development of Third Generation RXR Rexinoids as Potential Chemoprevention Agents,"Organ transplant patients who are immune-suppressed are at high risk to develop non-melanoma 
skin cancers (NMSC). Prevention of NMSC in this high risk population requires the development 
of effective drugs with minimal toxicity since these drugs are administered chronically. An FDA- 
approved drug has yet to be identified for use to prevent NMSC. We have developed a novel 
tissue-selective rexinoid, named UAB30, which acts as an agonist in epithelial tissues but not in 
liver. UAB30 is highly effective in multiple cancer prevention models while exhibiting minimal 
toxicity (especially lipid toxicity). UAB30 is currently evaluated in phase 1 human trials. 
Preliminary results (Core 3) show that UAB30 is highly effective in preventing the formation of 
papilloma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma in UVB-irradiated hairless mice. 
We have also shown that UAB30 up-regulates genes important for enhancing all-trans-retinoic 
acid biosynthesis in normal epithelium and in cancers. Thus, we hypothesize in this proposal that 
UAB30 (or other UAB30-like agonists) prevent NMSC by enhancing signaling through RXR-RAR 
heterodimers. In Aim 1, we propose studies to understand how rexinoids bind RXR and remodel 
the surface of the nuclear receptor to recruit coactivators. The importance of residues within the 
two putative molecular networks that bridge the rexinoid binding site to the coactivator binding 
site will be investigated using x-ray crystallography, Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass 
Spectrometry (HDX MS), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In Aim 2, we propose studies 
to understand if the molecular signatures of potency versus those of toxicity be revealed so that 
new 3rd -generation agonists are designed without toxicity. Structural studies on a series of 
methyl-derivatives of UAB30 have revealed a putative `hot-spot' in the ligand binding pocket that 
stimulates lipid biosynthesis and toxicity. We will examine the importance of this `hot-spot' by 
evaluating structures and dynamics of a series of potent rexinoids with known lipid profiles (potent 
rexinoids that induce lipid synthesis versus those that do not). A team of structural biologists with 
expertise in x-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, thermodynamics, and biophysics has been 
assembled to address these aims. Project 2 provides information on the structure and dynamics 
of RXR, which we hypothesized, can be important for determining which rexinoids are potent and 
nontoxic. Project 2 will interact with Core 2 in designing new 3rd generation rexinoids, which will 
be evaluated in in vitro studies in Project 3 and in in vivo models in Core 3. The Program 
Integration section contains a complete developmental schema for 3rd generation rexinoids.","There is a clinical need for an oral, non-toxic agent that prevents NMSC in organ transplant 
patients. The oral preventive agent, UAB30, is safe and its clinical evaluation could be widely

to identify new strategies for the identification drugs with clinical potential that exceeds UAB30.",2019,207303,213545,94339,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cancer; Dietary Supplements; Organ Transplantation; Prevention; Transplantation,DONALD D MUCCIO

approved drug has yet to be identified for use to prevent NMSC. We have developed a novel 
tissue-selective rexinoid, named UAB30, which acts as an agonist in epithelial tissues but not in 
liver. UAB30 is highly effective in multiple cancer prevention models while exhibiting minimal 
toxicity (especially lipid toxicity). UAB30 is currently evaluated in phase 1 human trials. 
Preliminary results (Core 3) show that UAB30 is highly effective in preventing the formation of 
papilloma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma in UVB-irradiated hairless mice. 
We have also shown that UAB30 up-regulates genes important for enhancing all-trans-retinoic 
acid biosynthesis in normal epithelium and in cancers. Thus, we hypothesize in this proposal that 
UAB30 (or other UAB30-like agonists) prevent NMSC by enhancing signaling through RXR-RAR 
heterodimers. In Aim 1, we propose studies to understand how rexinoids bind RXR and remodel 
the surface of the nuclear receptor to recruit coactivators. The importance of residues within the 
two putative molecular networks that bridge the rexinoid binding site to the coactivator binding 
site will be investigated using x-ray crystallography, Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass 
Spectrometry (HDX MS), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In Aim 2, we propose studies 
to understand if the molecular signatures of potency versus those of toxicity be revealed so that 
new 3rd -generation agonists are designed without toxicity. Structural studies on a series of 
methyl-derivatives of UAB30 have revealed a putative `hot-spot' in the ligand binding pocket that 
stimulates lipid biosynthesis and toxicity. We will examine the importance of this `hot-spot' by 
evaluating structures and dynamics of a series of potent rexinoids with known lipid profiles (potent 
rexinoids that induce lipid synthesis versus those that do not). A team of structural biologists with 
expertise in x-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, thermodynamics, and biophysics has been 
assembled to address these aims. Project 2 provides information on the structure and dynamics 
of RXR, which we hypothesized, can be important for determining which rexinoids are potent and 
nontoxic. Project 2 will interact with Core 2 in designing new 3rd generation rexinoids, which will 
be evaluated in in vitro studies in Project 3 and in in vivo models in Core 3. The Program 
Integration section contains a complete developmental schema for 3rd generation rexinoids.","There is a clinical need for an oral, non-toxic agent that prevents NMSC in organ transplant 
patients. The oral preventive agent, UAB30, is safe and its clinical evaluation could be widely 
used to prevent cancers in a high risk population. The basic science studies have the potential 
to identify new strategies for the identification drugs with clinical potential that exceeds UAB30.",2019,59920,44400,15520,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cancer; Dietary Supplements; Organ Transplantation; Prevention; Transplantation,DONALD D MUCCIO

2P30AI027767-31,Core C Clinical Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical Core (Core C)
Situated in the Deep South, with prominent footing in rural communities in Alabama and adjacent states, the
UAB CFAR Clinical Core (Core C) is uniquely positioned to support scientific inquiries at the interface of
prevention and treatment, clinic and community, to hasten an end to HIV/AIDS via the following Specific Aims:
1. To provide Computerized Database and Informatics Services, 2. To provide a comprehensive and efficient
Specimen Repository obtained from well-characterized persons living with HIV (PLWH), 3. To provide Study
Coordination Services, and 4. To provide comprehensive Biostatistical and Epidemiological Services. Core
C has been a cornerstone of the UAB CFAR since its inception, with the UAB 1917 HIV/AIDS Clinic (1917 Clinic)
as its focal point. Functioning as a learning healthcare system, observations made at the point of clinical care
have driven the scientific initiatives supported by Core C, aligned with the overarching CFAR mission, since
1988. The pursuit of knowledge to address clinically relevant questions has fueled discovery and scholarship
that has fed back to the 1917 Clinic to enhance service delivery and treatment outcomes for PLWH, with broad
impact nationally and globally. During the last 5-year funding period, Core C generated 780 analysis ready
datasets, processed 152,000 specimen vials, and captured 10,800 patient reported outcomes survey
assessments at the point of care, while supporting 70 extramural grants and publication of over 300 peer-review
manuscripts. A noteworthy milestone, the Clinical Core supported 12 early stage investigators (ESI) from UAB
and an additional 10 ESI from other CFARs during the last funding period, who were collectively awarded 15
career development awards (including 11 K awards) and 4 first R01 awards.
With a census of roughly 3,500 PLWH, disproportionately African Americans and men who have sex with men,
the 1917 Clinic remains the focal point of Core C. However, Clinical Core leadership extends beyond the 1917
Clinic to cultivate unique research platforms via the Jefferson County HIV/AIDS Community Coalition and
Alabama Quality Management Group that includes nine HIV clinics statewide providing care for over 6,800
PLWH. Core C innovations include integration of Biostatistical and Epidemiological Services to facilitate
synergies and efficiencies, roll out of a user-friendly, web-based REDCap Common Request Form to solicit any
(or multiple) core services, and the addition of a Phylogenetic Analysis Database, and Geospatial Database to
inform and augment HIV prevention and treatment science. Core C plays a pivotal role enhancing intra- and
inter-CFAR collaborations, providing vital research support and leadership to our Interdisciplinary Research
Groups and newly formed Ending HIV in Alabama Scientific Working Group, and leveraging synergies with other
research Centers, notably the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (UAB CTSA). Ultimately, the Clinical
Core mission is to provide ready access to integrated, comprehensive clinical and translational research services
to advance HIV prevention and treatment science to promote health equity and hasten an end to HIV/AIDS.",,2019,353396,237977,115419,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Health Services; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rural Health; Substance Abuse; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS),MICHAEL J MUGAVERO
1R61AT010802-01,A Mindfulness and Peer Mentoring Program to Improve Adherence to Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders,"Abstract
 Although medication assisted therapy (MAT) for opioid use disorders (OUD) is safe and effective and is
currently considered the gold standard for treating OUD, adherence to MAT regimens remains a challenge.
Initial studies have demonstrated efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions as adjunctive treatment for
substance use disorders (SUD) while reducing substance use and cravings. Additionally, non-randomized pilot
studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression
and anxiety in individuals undergoing MAT for OUD.5 In addition, peer recovery support services delivered by
individuals in recovery from SUD have also been found to be effective in reducing relapse rates, increasing
treatment retention, and improving relationships with treatment providers and social supports.6 Nonetheless,
recent studies that have used a combination of therapy and MAT have yielded mixed results, thereby
necessitating further exploration.7-8 Several factors, including depression, anxiety, stress, and cravings affect
adherence to MAT and other SUD treatment regimens because they increase likelihood of relapse.9-12
Additionally, physiologic stress reactivity and drug cue reactivity, often measured by the hormone cortisol have
been shown to be predictors of relapse.
 The goal of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention that
also utilizes peer mentors in addition to professional substance abuse therapists (the Minds and Mentors
program [MiMP]) in improving adherence to MAT for OUD and reducing relapse rates in a sample of
individuals with OUD who are also on MAT versus a twelve-step facilitation (TSF) program. The MiMP is an
eight-week intervention that uses group therapy and meets once a week for about two hours. We hypothesize
that participants in MiMP will demonstrate better adherence, reduced relapse and cravings (primary outcomes
measures), reduced depression, anxiety, and stress, and improved social support (secondary outcomes
measures), and reduced cortisol levels and reactivity to drug cues (exploratory outcome measures). This study
will utilize an individually randomized group treatment design. Data collection will occur at baseline (T0), end of
treatment (T1), and at 3 (T2), 6 (T3), and 12 (T4) months follow-up.
 The findings of the study have the potential to impact policy and practice changes related to treatment of
UUD and strategies to improve adherence to MAT. This intervention has the potential to ultimately decrease
morbidity and mortality in individuals with OUD by decreasing relapse and other comorbid psychosocial
outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Furthermore, this study may help in the identification of
individuals who are more reactive to stress, and who may need treatments that incorporate additional elements
focused on stress reduction.","Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance)
The aim of the proposed research effort is to (a) establish the feasibility and acceptability of the Minds and
Mentors Program (MiMP) for individuals undergoing medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use
disorders (OUD) and (b) to test its effectiveness in increasing adherence to MAT and reducing relapse and
cravings. The behavioral treatment involves group therapy that combines mindfulness-based relapse
prevention and peer mentoring. Effects on psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety, stress and social
support, and physiological stress reactivity to drug cues will be measured, thus providing a unique opportunity
to test the effectiveness of a program that may significantly enhance the ability to successfully OUD and
improving adherence to MAT.",2019,783788,585208,198580,Non-SBIR/STTR,R61,National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,AL,TUSCALOOSA,SCHOOLS OF NURSING,354870104,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Depression; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Mind and Body; Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Substance Abuse,Mercy N Mumba
5K12HL143958-02,"UAB Institutional Career Development Program in HIV-Related Heart, Lung, Blood and Research","The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has estimated there were more than 1.1 million people in the US living
with HIV in 2014. Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased the life expectancy of HIV+ individuals
and the number of US adults living with HIV is projected to increase by almost 40% over the next decade. This
has created a new challenge for people living with HIV in the US. People living with HIV have a high risk for
heart, lung, blood and sleep related diseases (NHLBI-targeted diseases). Furthermore, the prevalence and
incidence of both HIV and NHLBI-targeted diseases are higher among African Americans compared with other
race/ethnic groups and in the South compared with other regions of the US. Despite the recognized
importance of NHLBI-targeted diseases in people with HIV, few researchers have been trained in this area.
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is exceptionally well-suited to lead an institutional K12 Career
Development Program in HIV-related heart, lung, blood and sleep research. The burden of HIV and NHLBI-
targeted diseases is higher in the Southeast US compared with other geographic regions. The overall
objective of this K12 grant is to develop and sustain a training program for scholars to gain interdisciplinary,
intensive mentored research training and career development to become research leaders in the field of HIV-
related heart, lung, blood and sleep disease. To accomplish this goal, we have designed a career
development program that is interdisciplinary, involves didactic and experiential training opportunities, and
contains intensive mentorship. The key activities we propose include to (1) develop and deliver an intensive,
didactic curriculum with research rotations for additional skill development, (2) identify and recruit five scholars
for training to conduct heart, lung, blood and sleep-related research in the context of HIV, (3) provide career
development support through individual and team mentoring, (4) foster interdisciplinary team-science, and (5)
provide tailored research projects for scholars to lead. The UAB program will collaborate with the other K12
awardees from this NHLBI program to maximize opportunities and experiences received by scholars through
coordinating activities, including online courses. We will build this program on a strong foundation at UAB
including (1) the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), (2) a clinic site for major HIV studies (e.g., WIHS and
REPRIEVE), (3) ongoing NHLBI-funded cohort studies (e.g., CARDIA), (4) a large pool of established senior
mentors, (5) established research methods and career development workshops, (5) long-standing T32 and
K12 training programs and (6) a CTSA. Also, the co-Principal Investigators for this grant have complimentary
experience leading cardiovascular disease (Dr. Muntner) and HIV (Dr. Overton) research, strong track-records
mentoring scholars towards independence, and an established research collaboration involving lipids and
hypertension among patients with HIV. By completion of the K12 program, scholars be prepared to assemble,
launch and lead interdisciplinary teams conducting HIV-related heart, lung, blood and sleep research.","In order to reverse the increasing incidence and prevalence of heart, lung, blood and sleep-related disease in
people living with HIV, young scientists who focus their careers on this area is needed, but currently not
available. We propose to develop and provide a rigorous training and research opportunities to junior faculty
members who will work closely with experienced mentors offering guidance for them to develop independent
research careers.",2019,362301,335464,26837,Other Research-Related,K12,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Cardiovascular; HIV/AIDS; Heart Disease; Infectious Diseases,Paul  Muntner; EDGAR T OVERTON
5R01HL117323-06,Incorporation of a Hypertension Working Group into the Jackson Heart Study,"In the US, African Americans have a higher risk for hypertension, end-organ damage from hypertension, and
hypertension-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) and renal disease outcomes than other race groups. In
2015, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) assembled an ad-hoc working group to identify
research needs to improve hypertension treatment and blood pressure (BP) control in African Americans. In
this application, we propose the renewal of the Jackson Heart Study Hypertension Working Group (JHSâ€“
HWG), which will address several high priority needs identified by the NHLBI working group, and provide
mentorship to early stage investigators (ESIs) in hypertension research. Given its large sample size and
extensive phenotyping, the JHS is the ideal setting for addressing several knowledge gaps in hypertension
among African Americans. Between 2000 and 2004, 5,306 African Americans were enrolled in the JHS and
completed a baseline study visit that included clinic BP measurements, a pill bottle review, and questionnaires
on medication adherence and psychosocial factors. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) was
conducted at baseline in 1,046 JHS participants, making the JHS one of the largest studies with ABPM in the
US. Study visits have been conducted 4 and 8 years following baseline at which time hypertension onset and
organ damage were assessed. Participants have been followed over 10 years for CVD events. In the initial
three years of funding, JHS-HWG ESIs have published 16 manuscripts and have 11 manuscripts undergoing
peer review (26 with ESIs as the first author). JHS-HWG ESIs have been successful in obtaining grant funding
including one R01, five K awards, three diversity supplements and one pre-doctoral F31 grant award. Seven
of these ESIs are under-represented minorities. Further, JHS-HWG members have developed expert
knowledge of the JHS data set that will result in even higher productivity during the renewal period. For the 4-
year renewal period, we propose conducting in-depth studies in four new core thematic areas: (1) Remaining
free of hypertension across the lifespan, and among those with hypertension, remaining free of organ damage
and CVD events; (2) Using predicted CVD risk to guide antihypertensive medication initiation and titration; (3)
Maintaining persistent BP control over 8 years of follow-up; and (4) Diurnal BP patterns on ABPM. New
activities for ESIs include training in advanced statistical methods, analysis of administrative claims, conduct of
health policy evaluations, and leading pilot studies, which will begin the translation of findings from the JHS into
improving outcomes. The JHS-HWG will be led by principal investigators, who have a strong collaboration
history, and an established track record of publishing high impact hypertension research and mentoring ESIs.
The JHS-HWG also has an Advisory Committee, comprised of internationally recognized hypertension experts,
and a panel of Senior Faculty Mentors available to the ESIs. Ultimately, through the JHS-HWG, we aim to
improve the health of African Americans, and invigorate the next generation of hypertension researchers.","Public Health Significance: The Jackson Heart Study Hypertension Working Group (JHS-HWG) has
established an infrastructure to conduct high impact hypertension research. Over the next four years, the
JHSâ€“HWG will conduct research to identify approaches for reducing the burden of hypertension and
hypertension-related cardiovascular disease outcomes in African Americans. Also, the JHS-HWG will continue
to provide a foundation for early stage investigators to become leaders in the field of hypertension research.",2019,745170,603955,141215,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Prevention,Paul  Muntner; OLUGBENGA G.

5R01HL139716-02,Evaluating novel approaches for estimating awake and sleep blood pressure,"In the US, hypertension is diagnosed by measuring blood pressure (BP) in the clinic by a healthcare provider
or technician (attended clinic BP). However, this approach provides a poor estimate of a person's BP.
Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) measures BP automatically every 15 to 30 minutes outside of the clinic
setting typically for 24 hours including while a person is awake and asleep. Although ABPM is considered to be
the reference standard for diagnosing hypertension, it is not available in most clinics in the US and, when
available, it is not tolerated by many patients. These issues highlight the need for new approaches for
diagnosing hypertension. Canadian studies suggest that BP measured in the clinic using an automatic
oscillometric device without an observer being present (unattended clinic BP) may be closer to awake BP on
ABPM than attended clinic BP. However, these studies were uncontrolled with unattended clinic BP being
measured after attended clinic BP; attended clinic BP was performed using a mercury sphygmomanometer,
which is no longer the recommended for measuring BP; and often participants with very high attended clinic
BP were enrolled. A recent analysis of data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) did
not find a difference between clinic BP when measured attended or unattended. However, participants did not
have both attended and unattended BP measured at the same visit; all participants were taking
antihypertensive medication; and data from ABPM were not available as a reference standard. In addition to
elevated awake BP, elevated BP during sleep is associated with an increased risk of CVD. ABPM has been
the only method that could measure sleep BP. A home BP monitoring (HBPM) device has recently been
developed that can measure BP during sleep. In contrast to ABPM, these HBPM devices are worn for a shorter
period of time (only during sleep) with fewer BP measurements, and thus may be better tolerated than ABPM.
The goal of this study is to compare novel non-ABPM approaches to ABPM for measuring BP during
the awake and sleep periods and diagnosing hypertension. For Aim 1, we will test whether unattended
clinic BP provides a more accurate estimate of awake BP on ABPM than attended clinic BP. For Aim 2, we will
determine the accuracy of a new HBPM device for measuring sleep BP. We will also evaluate whether the
HBPM device is better tolerated than ABPM. For Aim 3, we will compare the associations of unattended clinic
BP and attended clinic BP versus awake BP on ABPM and sleep BP on HBPM versus ABPM with left
ventricular mass index and albuminuria. We will enroll 630 adults, not taking antihypertensive medication, with
systolic BP of 110 to 159 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 70 to 99 mm Hg in New York, NY and Birmingham, AL.
Participants will undergo both unattended and attended clinic BP, in random order, and ABPM and HBPM, also
in random order. This rigorously designed study will provide important data on whether these new approaches
can replace the need for conducting ABPM to assess awake and sleep BP and diagnose hypertension.","The way that blood pressure is being measured in clinical practice may lead to the misdiagnosis of
hypertension. This study will test a new approach for measuring blood pressure in the clinic for
accurately diagnosing hypertension. We will also test a new approach for measuring blood pressure
while people sleep.",2019,748307,607106,141201,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Hypertension; Prevention; Sleep Research,Paul  Muntner; DAICHI  SHIMBO
1R01HL147601-01,Home blood pressure and falls among older adults,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among older US adults. Over 75% of US adults â‰¥
65 years of age have hypertension, a major risk factor for CVD. Randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated that lowering blood pressure (BP) through antihypertensive medication reduces the risk for CVD
by 20% to 40% among older adults with hypertension. Many older US adults have uncontrolled BP and may
receive CVD risk reduction benefits from intensifying their antihypertensive medication. However, clinicians
are often concerned that intensively lowering BP may increase the risk for a fall. Falls are the leading cause of
injury-related hospitalization and death among older US adults and more than one in three US adults â‰¥ 65
years of age experience a fall each year. BP has traditionally been measured in the clinic setting and a major
challenge that clinicians encounter in deciding to titrate antihypertensive medication is the inaccuracy of BP
assessed in this setting. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is an inexpensive and highly feasible
approach to measure BP outside of the clinic setting and has the potential to improve BP control and,
therefore, reduce CVD risk. Whether HBPM can identify patients for whom antihypertensive medication can be
intensified without increasing the risk for a fall is unknown. A newly NIH-funded (July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2022)
prospective cohort study (AMBulatoRy blOod preSsure In older Adults [AMBROSIA]) will evaluate the
association of BP, measured outside of the clinic setting using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),
with falls risk among 1,057 adults aged â‰¥ 65 years, taking antihypertensive medication from the Kaiser
Permanente Southern California (KPSC) health system. ABPM was chosen for the AMBROSIA study as it is
considered the gold-standard approach for assessing out-of-clinic BP. Compared to ABPM, HBPM is more
widely available in the US and better tolerated by patients. The AMBROSIA study is not funded to perform
HBPM. The overall goal of the proposed ancillary study to AMBROSIA is to determine whether BP on HBPM
can identify older adults taking antihypertensive medication who are at increased risk for falls, and whether
HBPM provides similar predictive value for falls when compared with ABPM. AMBROSIA will begin study visits
in February 2019 and the proposed ancillary study (AMBROSIA-HOME) will add the conduct of HBPM for 7
days, with two BP measurements obtained in the morning and two BP measurements obtained in the evening
on each day, following the conduct of ABPM for 1,000 participants. Conducting the AMBROSIA-HOME study
will be cost-efficient as information on demographic and clinical characteristics, geriatric assessments,
research-grade BP measurements, and 24-hour ABPM is already being collected at baseline with falls and
serious fall injuries being assessed during a one-year follow-up period. The AMBROSIA-HOME study will
provide valuable data on the role of HBPM to personalize care for older adults taking antihypertensive
medication.","Healthcare providers must balance the cardiovascular benefits of blood pressure lowering medication with the
potential risk for falls among older adults with hypertension. Blood pressure has traditionally been measured in
the clinic setting; however, for many people, blood pressure differs when measured inside versus outside of
the clinic setting. The proposed study will determine whether self-measured blood pressure by a person in their
home, a procedure called home blood pressure monitoring, is useful for identifying older adults taking
antihypertensive medication who are at increased risk for falls.",2019,400222,337895,62327,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Hypertension; Prevention,Paul  Muntner; Kristi  Reynolds

innovations and a high-quality data production pipeline. High-quality dissected tissue from 9 anatomical sub-
regions from each of 4 post-mortem human brains free of psychiatric disease will be analyzed, along with
neuronal cell lines from 4 individuals collected by PsychENCODE investigators. Genome-wide binding profiles
from â€œChIP-seqâ€ experiments for 100 transcription factors will be measured across these tissue and cell types.
In addition, 6 of the key transcription factors will be analyzed in 2 brain regions from 96 individuals, including
individuals that were free of psychiatric disease (n=24) or had bipolar disorder (n=24), schizophrenia (n=24), or
major depressive disorder (n=24. These data will be used to assess the hypothesis that differential
transcription factor activity contributes directly to the risk and manifestation of disease, and is motivated by
previous observations from our groups of disease-associated transcriptional changes in brain tissue. Further,
integrative analyses of all these data, along with measurements of transcripts, DNA methylation, and other
data types that will be generated, will greatly enhance our understanding of the functional variability between
people and across different brain regions within a given person. These data will furthermore result in the
characterization of differences between healthy and disorder-affected individuals that may point to genes and
pathways that are of special diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic value. Finally, these data will be shared to
the greatest extent possible to substantially expand the depth and quality of brain tissue data resources

psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. However, a limited
understanding of how and when genes are expressed prevents the optimal use of genetic data, especially as it
relates to brain function. This project will generate a deep resource of knowledge about the locations and
properties of transcription factor activities, which are crucial to controlling the expression of genes, in both
healthy and disorder-affected brain tissues. This work will improve our knowledge of the genes, pathways, and
molecular mechanisms that contribute to the risk and manifestation of psychiatric disorders.",2019,1142486,864560,277926,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,AL,HUNTSVILLE,Research Institutes,358062908,Biotechnology; Bipolar Disorder; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Human Genome; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Prevention; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness,Gregory Michael Cooper; Richard M Myers
5UM1HG009411-03,An ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline using endogenously tagged human DNA-associated proteins,"Project Summary/Abstract
Almost a tenth of human genes code for proteins that interact with chromosomes in the nucleus. Most of these
DNA-associated proteins (referred to as DAPs) are involved in regulating the expression of genes, by serving
as part of the basic transcriptional machinery, as transcription factors that regulate the spatial and temporal
levels of transcription, or as chromatin state regulators. These proteins are key components in biology, as
transcriptional regulation underlies fundamental biological processes in organismal development, in
determining cell states during differentiation, and in directing physiological responses to the internal and
external environment. Thus, comprehensive and detailed assessment of the molecular actions of DAPs, that is,
where they interact throughout the human genome, is a fundamental long-term goal of both basic and clinical
research. In response to RFA-HG-16-002, â€œExpanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the
Human and Mouse (UM1)â€, this application proposes to use a recently-established ""shovel ready"" pipeline for
mapping DAPs in human cell lines that overcomes the very high failure rates of traditional ChIP-seq, a widely-
used approach that requires specific antibodies for each factor. The new approach, called CETCh-seq,
involves adding an epitope tag at the endogenous locus encoding each protein, and using chromatin
immunoprecipitation with a universal antibody against the epitope followed by high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq) to identify DAP-DNA associations genome-wide. This production pipeline will be applied to each of
1,244 DAPs that are expressed in a set of human cell lines and have not yet been mapped by ENCODE.
During the four-year project, this pipeline will be used to test each of these factors in one human cell line, and
for 100 of the DAPs, in four human cell lines, allowing characterization of cell-type differences. The project will
also tag and assay multiple allelic versions of a small number of DAPs in which pathogenic or potentially
pathogenic mutations have been identified. The project will produce genome-wide DAP maps and identify
motifs for hundreds of human regulatory proteins, providing an important component for the next phase of the
ENCODE Project. All data, as well as useful materials in the form of gene editing plasmids and tagged human
cell lines, will be made freely available to the research community.","Project Narrative
The ability to determine the entire genetic makeup â€“ the genome sequence â€“ of people has transformed the
way we study human biology, and is beginning to have a significant impact in predicting and treating human
disease. However, interpreting our genome sequences continues to be a challenge, leaving big gaps in our
understanding of normal and pathological human biology. This ambitious proposal seeks to apply high-
throughput genomic technologies to help overcome these limitations by improving the depth and breadth of
functional element annotations of human genomes, in particular, by mapping the locations throughout the
genome where regulatory proteins interact in human cells.",2019,1959410,1393199,566211,Non-SBIR/STTR,UM1,National Human Genome Research Institute,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,AL,HUNTSVILLE,Research Institutes,358062908,Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome,Eric  Mendenhall; Richard M Myers
5R01CA200624-04,Cytoplasmic Multimerization of the RNA-binding protein HuR is Oncogenic in Glioma,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is a primary malignancy of the central nervous system (CNS) that is universally fatal, extremely difficult to treat, and associate with tremendous burden to patients and caregivers due to the loss of neurological function. Aspects of the disease biology are being unraveled particularly the ""driver"" oncogenic events associated with the disease and the molecular subtypes. All reveal a complex tapestry suggesting downstream events of the classifying signatures are promoting a condition of extreme genomic instability. Our understanding of this altered state is limited and not in concordance with what biology teaches us, that this level of chromosomal instability should lead to mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Instead, we see a state of disease promotion and progression. We have reported on alterations occurring in the evolutionarily conserved cellular organelle, the centrosome induced by phosphoregulation of a RNA-binding protein, HuR (Human Antigen R). Aberrant regulation of HuR induces centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and disease progression. It is our hypothesis that cytoplasmic localization and multimer formation drives the oncogenic behavior of HuR. We believe that insights into this novel area of regulation will provide insights into the mechanisms of genomic instability in cancer. We have proposed three specific aims to determine the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of centrosomes in the promotion of chromosomal instability. In Aim 1, we will extend our initial mechanistic insights to dissect the control mechanisms through which multimerization of HuR promotes instability with resultant tumor progression. In the second aim, we will develop compounds identified that have the capacity to alter HuR function specifically the acquisition of the states of cytoplasmic localization and multimer formation. In the last aim, we will characterize the impact of HuR inhibition in primary GBM cell lines in vitro and in vivo.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancers, and particularly cancer of the nervous system, result from the accumulated effects of multiple molecular changes. The RNA-binding protein HuR sits at a node of control over multiple hallmarks of the cancer phenotype.

5R01HL137799-02,Thrombocytopoiesis in Diabetes:  Role of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns,"Platelets play an important role in the initiation and propagation of atherosclerosis and, more so, in the ensuing
atherothrombotic complications. Although the standard antiplatelet drugs reduce the risk of atherothrombotic
complications in high-risk patients, they are not very effective in diabetes mellitus (DM) subjects. The reasons
for this remains unclear but likely due to increased production/release of reticulated platelets (RP) from the
bone marrow (BM). The RPs are immature, larger in size, hyperreactive, and less responsive to standard anti-
platelet drugs. Platelet production is tightly regulated by the hormone thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, c-
MPL, which is found on several BM progenitor cells. While TPO is constitutively produced from BM stromal
cells and the kidney, the liver becomes their major source during inflammation where hepatic TPO production
is increased through the actions of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Our preliminary data suggests that hyperglycemia
enhances platelet biogenesis via mechanisms that involve neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9, a Damage
Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) complex, Kupffer cell (KC)-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hepatic TPO.
Studies in humans have also found a positive correlation between plasma S100A8/A9, IL-6, and platelet
aggregation. Most importantly increased serum S100A8/A9 is associated with reduced anti-platelet effects of
aspirin. Based on our preliminary data and the clinical evidence, we hypothesize that hyperglycemia-induced
IL-6 production from hepatic KCs elevates plasma TPO and initiate thrombocytopoiesis resulting in higher
proportion of RPs in the blood. The newly formed RPs, being hyperreactive, enhance platelet-leukocyte
interactions and contribute to atherothrombotic complications. In order to test this hypothesis, firstly, we will
examine how glucose enhances the production of RPs in diabetes. We will specifically identify the cross talk
between circulating neutrophils and KCs by manipulating blood glucose, neutrophils, serum S100A8/A9 and
RAGE/IL6 signaling in KCs and study how these manipulations affect RP production. Secondly, we will assess
the atherogenic and thrombogenic properties of RPs in diabetes by performing various platelet function assays
both in mice and type 2 DM subjects. The findings from these studies will have a broader impact on the current
anti-platelet therapy particularly in DM subjects as there is a great potential for discovery of novel targets to
treat cardiovascular disease. ","Diabetic patients who are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) have increased
number of immature platelets that are less responsive to standard anti-platelet drugs. Our research is

5R01AG050607-05,Acquired deficiency of innate immunity (ficolin-2) among elderly adults,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is known for causing pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), which are often lethal among elderly adults. Its virulence is mainly due to its expression of one of more than 90 serologically distinct polysaccharide (PS) capsules (i.e., serotypes). Most pneumococcal serotypes cause IPDs in both young children and elderly adults; however, for unknown reasons, pneumococci expressing the serotype 11A capsule cause IPDs almost exclusively in elderly adults or patients with cancer.  We have shown that ficolin-2 (L-ficolin), which can trigger the lectin pathway of the complement- activation cascade, deposits complement on 11A pneumococci, providing a natural protection against serotype 11A IPDs in young persons. We also found that the sera of many elderly (but not young) adults have ficolin-2 inhibitors and ligands. Since ficolin-2 can bind host apoptotic cells and mitochondria as well as pathogens, host cell fragments found in elderly and cancer patients may bind and inhibit ficolin-2. In addition, ficolin-2 inhibitors would reduce complement activation by the pneumococcal PS vaccine (PPV23), which contains 23 PSs including the 11A PS, and may thus reduce the immunogenicity to PPV23. To explain the presence of ficolin-2 inhibitors among the elderly, we have hypothesized that many elderly adults and cancer patients have host cell fragments in the circulation that bind and inhibit ficolin-2, reduce the immunogenicity of PPV23, and reduce hosts' survival.  To examine this hypothesis, we will A) Determine the epidemiology of ficolin-2 inhibitors using archived and fresh sera from elderly adults and cancer patients; B) Investigate the effects of ficolin-2 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in elderly adults by (i) investigating the
inhibitors' abilities to interfere with other lectin- pathway activators, (ii) their correlations wth other aging-associated parameters, and (iii) their responses to PPV23; and C) Identify the molecular nature of ficolin-2 inhibitors as ficolin-2 ligands with western blotting and mass spectrometry. Our studies will be greatly facilitated because of our prior experience in micro-scale purification and peptide sequencing of serum proteins and because of the availability of sera and information from an on-going 10-year study of the elderly at our university.  Although ficolin-2 binds numerous pathogens and host cell fragments, its roles in inflammation and infections are relatively unknown due to its recent discovery. Identification of the inhibitors' molecular nature will provide mechanistic insights into this novel acquired deficiency of innate immunity common among the elderly. By enhancing our understanding of the aging-associated increase in infection susceptibility and decline of the immune function, our proposed studies are directly relevant to the medical care of the elderly. Additionally, these studies will also have a broad relevance and impact on biology in general because ficolin-2 is an evolutionarily ancient molecule that has likely been integrated into many fundamental biologic processes.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Invasive diseases caused by serotype 11A Streptococcus pneumoniae are common among elderly adults and cancer patients, but are rare among young adults and children. Our studies have revealed that ficolin-2 provides innate immunity against pneumococcal infections by serotype 11A in young adults, while the innate immunity is non-functional in many elderly adults because most of their sera contain inhibitors to ficolin-2. We propose to study the epidemiology, clinical significance, and molecular bases for these ficolin-2 inhibitors because such studies will provide new insights into managing pneumococcal infections among elderly adults, immunosenescence, and the acquired deficiency of innate immunity.",2019,316050,215000,101050,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza,Moon H.

1R01NS107071-01A1,Radiation-Induced Crosstalk of Immune and Glioma Stem Cells,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain cancer with a mean survival of shorter than 2 years. Current standard-
of-care therapies provide only palliation, indicating an urgent need to develop more effective therapies.
Accumulating evidence suggests that GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) possess intrinsic molecular mechanisms and
adopt extrinsic signals to escape from therapeutic insults, causing subsequent lethal tumor recurrence. However,
molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate how GSCs react to therapeutic insult remain poorly understood.
Thus, this knowledge gap has hampered efforts to develop effective therapies that prevent GBM growth and
recurrence. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that therapy-induced adoptive changes in immune
microenvironment promotes GSC therapy resistance to drive GBM recurrence. We have developed this
hypothesis based on our recent findings in our 6 research articles. First, we identified that the mesenchymal
differentiation of GSCs promotes therapy resistance accompanied by the aberrant NF-kB activation and
increased pro-tumorigenic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (Mao et al., PNAS 2013; Bhat et al., Cancer
Cell 2013; Kim et al., Cancer Cell 2016). Following these studies, we identified that the mesenchymal GSCs
activates the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL (Chang et al., Stem Cell Reports 2015), unlike the non-Mesenchymal
GSCs with activated PDGFRÎ± (Jeon et al., Cancer Res 2014; Sadahiro et al., Cancer Res 2018). To further
extend these studies, we will investigate if and how the crosstalk between mesenchymal GSCs and TAMs
promotes therapy resistance of GBM. In Aim 1, we will examine the molecular mechanisms in GSCs that receive
inter-cellular signals from TAMs through AXL. In Aim 2, we will examine the molecular signaling mechanisms in
TAMs that increase secretion of the AXL-binding ligand PROS1 after immunotherapy with Nivolumab (PD-1
inhibitor). In Aim 3, we will determine the efficacy of the combination of Nivolumab and the AXL inhibitor BGB324
for the preclinical GBM models. Collectively, we anticipate that this study will yield a new paradigm for the GSC
biology and a novel therapeutic approach to target key regulators of GSC, which may lead to the translation into
improved therapies.","GBM remains one of the deadliest human cancers with no curative therapeutic options we can offer to patient;
the devastating outcome of affected patients has not been improved for over three decades. Thus, more effective
treatment is urgently needed. This proposal will investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the

5R01CA183991-05,Novel role of compensatory proliferation in human brain tumor,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating form of primary brain cancer with poor prognosis. GBM cells are heterogeneous containing a subpopulation of glioma stem cells (GSCs)-, chemo- and radiotherapy resistant cells with prominent tumorigenic ability, and non- GSCs. Here, we propose a novel concept for the significance of non-GSCs for GBM stemness - irradiation triggers paradoxical signals from apoptotic signals in non-GSCs to induce an inter-cellular proliferative signal in the neighboring GSCs, rendering them hyper- proliferative and therapy-resistant GSCs in GBM. This hypothesis is based on the elegant studies in Drosophila eye cancer models demonstrating that inter-clonal cooperation and signaling from apoptotic clones provoke aggressive growth of neighboring tumorigenic clones. These aggressive tumors show up-regulation of JNK (upstream of c-JUN), Dronc (Drosophila Casp9) and Wg (Drosophila Wnt). Our preliminary data suggests that, even in human cancers, c-JUN (and its binding partner MELK), Caspase 9, and Wnt likely contribute to the hyper-proliferation in aggressive tumors. Given the importance of Wnt in the CNS development and self- renewal of stem cells, we hypothesize that, similar to the Drosophila cancer models, induction of apoptosis in non-GSCs drives compensatory proliferation of GSCs through Wnt activation in humans. We propose to study the inter-cellular interactions between the apoptosis-prone non-GSC cells and the hyper-proliferative GSCs using the in vitro tumor sphere cultures and xenograft based mammalian models. As the proof-of-principal and for the clinical development, we will then test the efficacy of the MELK inhibitor and the WNT inhibitor, both of which were currently tested by Phase I Clinical Trial for advanced non-CNS cancers. We believe that this ""co- clinical trial"" approach will guide us to design successful Phase II/III trils for clinical use of novel anti-cancer drugs. Overall, our research is novel because the conceptual idea that the dying non-GSCs secrete signals that induce proliferation of GSCs is promising and untested. Our approaches and investigation will yield insights about molecular signaling interactions in the context of post-irradiation management of GBM, and is likely to revise our understanding of changes in gene expression and cell-cell interactions post-irradiation, which is a vital area of cancer biology with wide-applications to many cancer types.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High Grade Glioma (HGG) is a devastating cancer in the brain with few therapeutic options, and therefore, more effective treatment is urgently needed.

5R01MH110681-04,Cellular Mechanism of Synchrony Impairments in Schizophrenia,"Abstract
Abnormal neuronal synchrony at gamma range, often observed in schizophrenia, may be associated with
cognitive deficits. Although evidence suggests that cortical fast-spiking interneurons targeting pyramidal cells
may be involved in neuronal synchrony, cellular basis of abnormal neuronal synchrony in schizophrenia
remains to be identified. We recently demonstrated that early postnatal deletion of NMDA receptors in cortical
and hippocampal interneurons, majority of which are parvalbumin containing, was sufficient to trigger several
pathophysiological features in mice that resemble human schizophrenia. The mutant mice exhibit several
behavioral cognitive-like deficits and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex. They also display a diminished
spike synchrony between cortical pyramidal cells and a deficit in tone-evoked gamma frequency oscillatory
activity of local field potentials in auditory cortex, measured by in vivo recordings. It is crucial to delineate the
underlying mechanisms of the synchronous firing impairment of postsynaptic neurons following NMDA receptor
ablation in cortical interneurons. We recently discovered that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is up-
regulated and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channel currents are diminished in NMDAR-deleted fast-spiking interneurons
of the mutant mice. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 activity augmented Cav2.1 channel currents and largely
ameliorates the deficit in synchronized GABA release ex vivo. We hypothesize that that GSK3 up-regulation in
the NMDA receptor-deficient fast-spiking interneurons down-regulates Cav2.1 channel function, which impairs
synchronized GABA release and synchronized oscillations in the cortex producing cognitive dysfunction. The
objective of this application is to determine whether dysregulation of GSK3 and Cav2.1 channels in the NMDA
receptor-deleted fast-spiking neurons is crucial for an impaired synchronized GABA release and whether
functional restoration of these molecules rescues not only in vivo abnormal neuronal synchrony but also
behavioral cognitive dysfunction. The proposed studies may yield new insights into cellular mechanisms of
cortical neuronal synchrony, potentially leading to development of novel drugs for cognitive dysfunction of
schizophrenics, which is currently medically intractable.","Public Health Relevance/Narrative
Although the mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is poorly understood, recent
evidence has indicated that schizophrenia is associated with abnormal amplitude and synchrony of neuronal

5R01HL118067-07,Reductive Stress Induces Proteotoxic Cardiac Disease,"Conventionally, oxidative stress is considered pathological to cardiac protein quality control (PQC), which
rationalizes the therapeutic potential of antioxidants. However, many clinical trials of antioxidant
supplementation failed to deliver a positive impact and, rather, demonstrated adverse effects in various organs,
including those in the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence suggests that reductive stress (RS), also
known as antioxidative stress, may cause ER stress and accumulation of mis/unfolded proteins. To fully
comprehend the molecular interplay underlying RS-mediated proteotoxicity and the time frame for myocardium
experiencing a transition from adaptive to maladaptive remodeling, it is critical to identify the molecular
participants, their dynamic interplay, and resulting sequential events (e.g., autophagy) that regulate PQC.
 Recently, our exciting and novel clinical observations revealed a link of chronic RS (cRS) underlying
disease progression of human heart failure (HF). We screened a selected group of HF patients (n=50, without
other major comorbidities) for their peripheral blood redox state; among them, a subset (n=8) displayed the RS
condition. Our proposed study will entail a translational component utilizing proteomics approaches and
molecular biology to better understand the etiology of RS in mouse models and to identify its relevance in HF
patients. Our central hypothesis is that cRS will alter proteome properties (e.g., protein dynamics & post-
translational modifications, or PTMs) and damage autophagy signaling, leading to persistent proteotoxicity and
cardiac dysfunction, thereby driving maladaptive remodeling in animal models and in human heart diseases.
We propose three aims: Aim 1 will determine altered protein dynamics, redistributed PTMs, and perturbed
autophagy subproteome in RS conditions. We will define the â€œreductome signaturesâ€ in control and cRS
phenotypes. Aim 2 will examine the impact of cRS on progressive damage of autophagy that may lead to
insufficient cargo-clearance and proteotoxicity in the myocardium over time. We will assess autophagosome
formation, autophagy flux, and protein folding capacity under cRS conditions and examine whether enhancing
autophagy delays and/or prevents proteotoxicity in mice. Aim 3 will examine the â€œredox phenotypeâ€ in the
peripheral blood of HF patients using HPLC based quantification of (a) GSH redox ratio, (b) lipid peroxidation,
and (c) total antioxidant capacity, as well as extract the molecular â€œreductome signaturesâ€ in HF patients with
RS using a computational platform to determine essential proteome features and regulatory pathways. This
aim will establish a translational value for the RS hypothesis in human HF.
 We have assembled a multidisciplinary team (scientists & physicians) with documented expertise in redox
biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and computational analyses. The genetic mouse models of RS, the
technology platforms, and the biochemical assays to evaluate RS in mouse and in human are all established in
our laboratories. We anticipate the successful completion of our proposed goals.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Accumulation and aggregation of defective proteins in the heart impair protein quality control and induce
cardiac hypertrophy, leading to heart failure. Reductive stress (abnormal increase in antioxidants) leads to
unresolved ER stress, sustained accumulation of mis/unfolded proteins, and augmented proteotoxicity. In this

3R01HL118067-07S1,Reductive Stress Induces Proteotoxic Cardiac Disease,"Conventionally, oxidative stress is considered pathological to cardiac protein quality control (PQC), which
rationalizes the therapeutic potential of antioxidants. However, many clinical trials of antioxidant
supplementation failed to deliver a positive impact and, rather, demonstrated adverse effects in various organs,
including those in the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence suggests that reductive stress (RS), also
known as antioxidative stress, may cause ER stress and accumulation of mis/unfolded proteins. To fully
comprehend the molecular interplay underlying RS-mediated proteotoxicity and the time frame for myocardium
experiencing a transition from adaptive to maladaptive remodeling, it is critical to identify the molecular
participants, their dynamic interplay, and resulting sequential events (e.g., autophagy) that regulate PQC.
 Recently, our exciting and novel clinical observations revealed a link of chronic RS (cRS) underlying
disease progression of human heart failure (HF). We screened a selected group of HF patients (n=50, without
other major comorbidities) for their peripheral blood redox state; among them, a subset (n=8) displayed the RS
condition. Our proposed study will entail a translational component utilizing proteomics approaches and
molecular biology to better understand the etiology of RS in mouse models and to identify its relevance in HF
patients. Our central hypothesis is that cRS will alter proteome properties (e.g., protein dynamics & post-
translational modifications, or PTMs) and damage autophagy signaling, leading to persistent proteotoxicity and
cardiac dysfunction, thereby driving maladaptive remodeling in animal models and in human heart diseases.
We propose three aims: Aim 1 will determine altered protein dynamics, redistributed PTMs, and perturbed
autophagy subproteome in RS conditions. We will define the â€œreductome signaturesâ€ in control and cRS
phenotypes. Aim 2 will examine the impact of cRS on progressive damage of autophagy that may lead to
insufficient cargo-clearance and proteotoxicity in the myocardium over time. We will assess autophagosome
formation, autophagy flux, and protein folding capacity under cRS conditions and examine whether enhancing
autophagy delays and/or prevents proteotoxicity in mice. Aim 3 will examine the â€œredox phenotypeâ€ in the
peripheral blood of HF patients using HPLC based quantification of (a) GSH redox ratio, (b) lipid peroxidation,
and (c) total antioxidant capacity, as well as extract the molecular â€œreductome signaturesâ€ in HF patients with
RS using a computational platform to determine essential proteome features and regulatory pathways. This
aim will establish a translational value for the RS hypothesis in human HF.
 We have assembled a multidisciplinary team (scientists & physicians) with documented expertise in redox
biology, biochemistry, proteomics, and computational analyses. The genetic mouse models of RS, the
technology platforms, and the biochemical assays to evaluate RS in mouse and in human are all established in
our laboratories. We anticipate the successful completion of our proposed goals.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01NS081366-08,GAA REPEATS INDUCED EPIGENETIC SILENCING IN FRIEDREICH'S ATAXIA,"Friedreichâ€™s ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomal recessive ataxia. It is caused by reduced levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN) as a result of large expansions of GAA trinucleotide repeats located in the first intron of the FXN gene. Although the FXN coding sequence in FRDA patients is unaltered, transcription of the gene is suppressed as a consequence of the large GAA expansions. Downregulation of FXN expression is associated with a transition of chromatin surrounding the GAAs from an active to a repressed state, however the underlying molecular mechanism of FXN silencing remains largely unknown. At the present time there is no effective treatment for FRDA and transcriptional silencing of FXN is one of the primary targets for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, understanding the mechanism governing GAA-induced silencing is of critical importance for therapy development. Based on our preliminary studies we hypothesize that long, expanded GAA repeats induce replication stress leading to changes of the replication program at the endogenous FXN locus. A resulting collision between transcription and replication suppresses transcription elongation and stimulates expansions of GAA repeats. The transcription elongation defect is further amplified in trans by deficiency of specific transcriptional co-factors. To address this hypothesis, we will focus on three fundamental questions regarding the molecular pathogenesis of Friedreichâ€™s ataxia: 1) How does interplay between transcription and replication at the endogenous FXN locus affect gene silencing and expansions of GAA repeats? 2) Which step of the transcription process is affected by expanded GAA repeats in FRDA cells? 3) What is the contribution of trans-factors to the transcriptional defect in FRDA? First, we will dissect mechanisms of molecular interplay between transcription and replication in the endogenous FXN locus using a set of CRISPR/Cas9 engineered FRDA cells. Furthermore, we will employ the precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) technique to determine the profile of nascent transcription at the FXN locus, while also defining the exact step of transcription affected by expanded GAA repeats. Additionally, we will define the influence of reactivation of FXN transcription on progressive expansions of the GAAs to evaluate potential risks associated with long-term reactivation of FXN expression. Lastly, our preliminary data from transcriptome profiling of a large cohort of FRDA and control cells demonstrated a profound downregulation of a set of transcription elongation co-factors in FRDA cells. We will elucidate the mechanism whereby these trans-factors affect transcriptional processivity of the FXN gene to identify new therapeutic targets for FRDA. To answer these questions, we will use a battery of FRDA cell models generated in our laboratory, including FRDA patient fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells, neuronal and cardiac cells differentiated from the pluripotent cells. Collectively, successful completion of this project will uncover the molecular events occurring at the FXN locus in FRDA cells and define cis- elements as well as trans-factors critical for repeat-induced FXN silencing and GAAs expansion. Combined approaches of genome editing, pharmacological modulation, and high resolution transcriptome analyses performed in a spectrum of thoughtfully chosen FRDA models will fuel development of new therapeutic approaches","Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by

5R01EY026947-04,The role of (O-acyl)-omega-hydroxy fatty acids in human lipid layer structure and function in health and meibomian gland dysfunction.,"Project Summary
 Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the most prevalent ophthalmic conditions with
millions of Americans suffering from the condition. In addition to burdensome symptoms, meibum
and tear film alterations from MGD can impact ocular health by leading to ocular surface
desiccation and an increased risk of inflammation or infectious disease and an abnormal ocular
flora. Although these things are becoming better understood, the molecular basis for the
mechanisms of lipid layer and tear film disruption are not well understood. Initial evidence from
the literature and preliminary studies suggests that the O-acyl omega hydroxy fatty acids
(OAHFAs) found in the meibum and tear film lipids are associated with increased in vivo lipid layer
disruption and tear film thinning. The long-term goal of this research is to identify a molecular
marker that predicts structural and functional changes in the meibum and tear film such that it
may be considered a potential targeted therapeutic.
 Specific Aim #1 is targeted to quantitate and identify OAHFAs that are proposed to be
decreased in the meibum and tear film in MGD. Quantitative differences will be determined using
mass spectrometry, with class and species identification resultant from electrospray ionization
(ESI) with a quadrupole time-of-flight (q-TOF) tandem MS for high resolution mass and structural
information and SWATH analysis. Specific Aim #2 is targeted to determine the structural impact
of the decrease in OAHFAs on the lipid layer of the tear film (e.g., reduced thickness, non-uniform
lipid lens appearance); a high resolution microscope will be used to study the in vivo structure of
the lipid layer. Specific Aim #3 will determine the functional impact of the disorganization of the
lipid layer relative to increased evaporation of the aqueous tear film via rapid tear film thinning. In
Specific Aim #3, a non-invasive interferometric optical system will be used to measure tear film
thinning on the ocular surface in relation to Specific Aims #1 and #2.","Narrative

1R21HG010543-01,Single-chain MspA for nanopore sequencing of DNA,"Project Summary - Single-chain MspA for nanopore sequencing of DNA
New DNA sequencing technologies have transformed biomedical research and clinical
applications. Due to its low cost, fast sample processing time, minimal sample amount, and lack
of sample amplification, nanopore sequencing is a very promising technology to further reduce
costs and increase read length of the DNA sequencing. Essential to this method is a nanopore
which can be produced from inorganic, organic or biological materials. Despite recent
advancements significant challenges remain for nanopore sequencing of DNA. For example, the
residual current of each nucleobase in the MspA pore is determined by approximately four
nucleotides reducing the accuracy of base calling, DNA translocation through the pore is too
fast, and the stochastic activity of DNA-processing enzymes complicates data analysis. These
challenges could, in principle, be addressed by protein engineering, which, however, is
hampered by the oligomeric structure of MspA and all other currently used biological nanopores.
This proposal is based on the construction of single-chain MspA in which all eight subunits are
linked. Single-chain MspA enables us to control the subunit assembly of the MspA pore and the
chemical properties of each channel residue by site-directed mutagenesis. This technological
breakthrough provides the basis for further improvement of the sequencing capabilities of MspA.
The goals of this proposal are to characterize the channel activity of single-chain MspA and its
DNA sequencing properties and to systematically alter the pore diameter of MspA by
constructing scMspA pores with different subunit stoichiometries. This will enable us, for the first
time, to examine the influence of the pore diameter on nucleobase recognition by a biological
nanopore.","Project Narrative - Single-chain MspA for nanopore sequencing of DNA

essential for growth of Mtb, but iron is efficiently sequestered in the human host. Hemoglobin is
by far the most prevalent iron source in the human body and is often preferred by bacterial
pathogens. Recently, we identified proteins that are essential components of an unprecedented
heme and hemoglobin utilization system in Mtb. Interestingly, these novel heme-binding

hemoglobin at the cell surface of Mtb by an unknown mechanism and then transferred to the
heme uptake system. This proposal aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of heme and

5R01AI121354-04,The necrosis-inducing toxin of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important and widespread bacterial diseases and a global health threat. Survival within infected macrophages is a key feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis and is crucial to a persistent infection in the human host. The lack of any protein with sequence similarities to bacterial toxins
and the apparent absence of a protein toxin with profound effects on host cells led to the widely accepted assumption that Mtb does not have these classical virulence factors. However, this paradigm was challenged by our discovery of the outer membrane protein CpnT which is utilized by Mtb to secrete a toxic C- terminal domain. This toxin is required by Mtb to replicate i macrophages, is the major cytotoxicity factor of Mtb in macrophages and causes necrotic cell death of host cells. Hence, we named this protein Tuberculosis Necrotizing Toxin (TNT). Killing of infected macrophages by necrosis is a well-known, but poorly understood virulence mechanism of Mtb to escape phagosomal containment and the adaptive immune response. Recently, we discovered that TNT is a novel NAD+-glycohydrolase which gains access to the cytosol of infected macrophages in an ESX-1 dependent manner. Mtb protects itself from CpnT/TNT toxicity by producing an antitoxin which we named Immunity Factor of TNT (IFT). IFT inactivates the enzyme activity of TNT upon binding. The discovery of IFT enabled us to produce TNT protein in mg quantities and, subsequently, to solve the crystal structure of the TNT-IFT complex and characterize the purified TNT protein enzymatically. We have identified catalytically inactive TNT mutants, which we will use to define the role of this Mtb toxin in the molecular pathway ultimately leading to necrosis of infected macrophages. Thus, we are now able to examine a novel molecular mechanism of paramount importance for the interaction of Mtb with host cells. These findings will also be important for more than 200 bacterial and fungal pathogens with TNT homologs and for understanding the molecular consequences of NAD+ depletion in host cells.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important and widespread bacterial diseases and a global health threat.

1R01MH116869-01A1,Role of adolescent stress in postpartum mood and cognition,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mood disturbance and cognitive impairment during the postpartum period are common and serious problems in
women's mental health. Early life stress, such as psychosocial stress during adolescence, increases the risk for
postpartum emotional and cognitive problems in humans, including the development of postpartum mood
disorders. Nonetheless, the biological mechanisms linking adolescent stress to postpartum emotional and
cognitive abnormalities are not well understood. Our long-term goal is to examine how pre-partum life stress
affects hormonal systems, neural function, and behaviors in the developmental trajectory from adolescence to
the postpartum period and dissect the mechanisms from molecules to circuits and behavior. Human imaging
studies have linked functional changes in the projections from the anterior insula (AI) to dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex [dACC, homologous to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) in rodents] to postpartum behavioral changes. Elevated
levels of glucocorticoids by disturbance of negative feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during
the postpartum period can alter neural function. To gain more biological insight into these points, we have built a
novel platform to study the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of adolescent stress on postpartum
emotional and cognitive behaviors in first-time mothers, based on the adolescent social isolation paradigm we
have already published. Hence, our current objective is to test the hypothesis that adolescent stress, in
conjunction with the stressful events of pregnancy/delivery, leads to deficits in postpartum behaviors related to
mood and social cognition via glucocorticoid-mediated functional alterations of AI-PrL glutamatergic projections.
To address this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will examine the role of
AI-PrL projections in adolescent stress-induced PrL dysfunction and behavioral deficits in adult postpartum mice
using a combination of state-of-the-art techniques, including in vivo calcium imaging in conjunction with
projection-specific neuronal manipulation in freely moving mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in adolescent stress-induced PrL dysfunction and behavioral deficits in adult
postpartum mice. In Aim 3, we will combine retrograde tracing and cell type-specific manipulation using the
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-dependent Cre recombinase system to examine the causal role of
GR-mediated AI-PrL glutamatergic projections in the PrL dysfunction and behavioral deficits in adult postpartum
mice pre-exposed to adolescent isolation rearing. Our findings may provide biological insights into postpartum
mood disturbance and cognitive impairment, which are highly prevalent and have deleterious effects not only on
the mother, but also on the children and the rest of the family. These findings will have a broad impact on the
well-being of women and children worldwide.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R21CA223126-02,Identifying outcome mediators of calorie restriction mimetic use in renal cancer,"Project Summary:
Calorie restriction has proven, potent benefits in terms of delaying cancer progression, but long-term calorie
restriction is difficult to translate into human use. For this reason, calorie restriction mimetics (CRM) are being
developed to replicate the beneficial effects of calorie restriction without the need for significant caloric
limitation. Recently, the use of CRM has been shown to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy by: 1) inducing
autophagy in tumor cells, 2) increasing CD8 T cells infiltration into tumors, and 3) reducing localized tumor
burdens. However, no study has yet tested the effects of CRM use in a pre-clinical model of spontaneous
tumor metastasis, and the effects of CRM use + immunotherapy have not been evaluated at all.
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical treatment modalities available today for patients with
metastatic disease, but clinical response rates remain <50%. If CRM use could act as adjuvant to boost
immunotherapy-induced anti-tumor immunity, this could represent a major advance in clinical management of
advanced cancer patients. We have been studying acarbose, an FDA-approved anti-diabetic drug and CRM, to
better understand its effects on host metabolism, tumor outgrowth, and the immune system. Here, we
investigate the ability of acarbose to enhance the efficacy of a CD8 T cell-based immunotherapy in the context
of spontaneously metastasizing murine renal tumors. Our study of acarbose in tumor-free mice illustrates its
action as a CRM: despite increased food intake, male and female mice have decreased fat mass, decreased
leptin, and equal or diminished weight gain. In the absence of tumor growth, acarbose produced no significant
changes in splenic leukocyte composition, but following orthotopic renal tumor challenge, acarbose markedly
enhanced CD8 T cell infiltration into tumors (p = 0.04). One drawback was that tumor-bearing mice fed an
acarbose-containing diet exhibited weight loss that was not seen in tumor-challenged mice on control diet (p =
.001). This same type of adverse event was reported previously in mice treated with CRM+chemotherapy.
Thus, despite increasing CD8 T cell infiltration into tumors, CRM use may trigger significant adverse events
that could limit clinical translation. For these reasons, pre-clinical studies are needed to understand how best to
use CRMs safely in the context of immunotherapy. We hypothesize that CRM use will synergize with CD8 T
cell-based immunotherapy to facilitate tumor eradication in a majority of mice, permitting the
identification of specific biologic and physiologic biomarkers that correlate with treatment success.
The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) assess CRM effects on immunotherapeutic outcomes in a relevant
pre-clinical model of metastatic renal cancer; and 2) identify local and systemic metabolic, inflammatory, and
cellular immune biomarkers that could be used to evaluate both treatment success and adverse events such
as weight loss in future clinical studies on CRM+ immunotherapy use in advanced cancer patients.","Project Narrative
Renal tumors are immunogenic and responsive to T cell-based immunotherapies.
Despite this, clinical response rates remain <30% and combinatorial approaches are
being developed to improve immunotherapeutic efficacy. As caloric restriction mimetics
were recently shown to enhance chemotherapy outcomes in a T cell-dependent manner,
we propose to investigate the use of calorie restriction mimetics + immunotherapy in a
pre-clinical model of advanced renal cancer, for the purpose of identifying therapeutic
benefits and drawbacks that will inform translation into future clinical practice.",2019,156648,105487,51161,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,352940001,Biotechnology; Cancer; Immunization; Immunotherapy; Kidney Disease; Nutrition; Vaccine Related,Lyse A Norian
2R01DK078244-10A1,Molecular Basis of Pathogenicity of IgA1-containing Immune Complexes,"Abstract
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Due to lack of
disease-specific therapy, many patients progress to end-stage renal disease. IgAN is defined by the
characteristic IgA1 mesangial deposits. Based on our published data, we have developed an original
pathogenesis model that describes sequential steps and molecular candidates for the development of disease.
This model is recognized by other researchers in the field as a blueprint for development of disease-specific
biomarkers and treatments. In the past funding period, we demonstrated that the majority of IgAN patients,
regardless of age and ethnicity, have immunologic defects resulting in generation of pathogenic IgA1-
containing immune complexes. We have further shown that the pathogenic immune complexes consist of IgA1
with some O-glycans deficient in galactose (Gd-IgA1), although Gd-IgA1 alone is not sufficient to induce IgAN.
A second critical step in the pathogenesis of IgAN is the development of autoantibodies that bind Gd-IgA1 and
form pathogenic immune complexes. Our new data revealed that IgG extracted from glomerular deposits of
IgAN patients is specific for Gd-IgA1. Importantly, serum levels of Gd-IgA1 (autoantigen) and IgG
autoantibodies specific for Gd-IgA1 each correlate with disease severity and progression. Our analyses also
revealed the presence of complement proteins in Gd-IgA1-IgG circulating immune complexes. This finding is
consistent with our GWAS that identified a major role for a common deletion of the complement factor H-
related factors 1 and 3 (CFHR 1,3 del) that impacts C3 activation. We have identified major activation
pathways induced by Gd-IgA1-IgG complexes in primary human mesangial cells and shown that blockade of
the initial signaling steps prevented aberrant cellular activation. Moreover, we have begun to validate these
findings in a novel mouse model of IgAN we developed. In this revised competing renewal application, we
hypothesize that, in individuals with an autoimmune predisposition, elevated Gd-IgA1 is associated with the
development of IgG autoantibodies specific for Gd-IgA1. These events direct the formation of pathogenic
immune complexes and additional proteins modulate the pathogenic potential of these complexes, thus
affecting disease presentation and progression. We will follow-up our findings using unique, clinically and
genetically well-characterized, cohorts of IgAN patients. We will define the biological and clinical impact of IgG
autoantibodies, including the timeline for production before disease onset (Aim 1). We will assess the
composition of Gd-IgA1-IgG immune complexes in the circulation vs. in the glomerular deposits (IgG
subclasses, complement proteins) (Aim 2) and determine the role of complement in biological activity of the
pathogenic Gd-IgA1-IgG complexes (Aim 3). Relevance: Our studies will define factors associated with
development and progression of IgAN and thus provide information concerning stratification of patients for
clinical trials and development of a future disease-specific therapy.","Narrative
IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis in the world, with many patients
progressing to end-stage renal disease, as there is no disease-specific treatment. We propose to define the
biological and clinical impact of IgG autoantibodies and other proteins associated with pathogenic immune
complexes that lead to the development and progression of disease. The results of the proposed experimental
and clinical studies will provide a basis for the development of noninvasive tests for the detection of disease
activity prior to irreversible kidney damage and suggest disease-specific therapeutic strategies.

5R00NR015903-04,An Upstream Palliative Care Intervention for Rural Family Caregivers,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K99/R00 application describes the background and experience of the applicant, J. Nicholas Dionne- Odom, PhD, RN, and his plan to acquire the knowledge and training necessary to become a leading independent clinical investigator in developing and testing telehealth palliative care interventions that optimize the outcomes of rural family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with advanced cancer. The overall goal during the K99 phase is to gain advanced research training in developing interventions, conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and health coaching/motivational interviewing in order to develop and test a telehealth program for rural FCGs of persons with advanced cancer living in the Southern US. Based on Pearlin's Model of Family Caregiving, the goal of this new intervention will be to promote FCGs' self-efficacy, competence, and decision- making skills by coaching them about how to manage not only the care demands and needs of their care recipients but also their own needs. The specific training objectives during the K99 phase are to: (1) develop and tailor interventions, to: 1a) gain advanced understanding of community engagement in research using mixed methods; 1b) develop advanced understanding and skills in developing, manualizing, and assessing fidelity of an intervention; 1c) gain greater understanding of cutting edge telehealth and other m-health developments; and 1d) develop greater understanding of spiritually- and faith-based-oriented interventions; (2) develop skills to
design and lead RCTs relevant to family caregiving; 3) augment knowledge and skills in health coaching; and (4) continue training in research ethics. The research specific aim during the K99 phase is: through interviews with a) rural dwelling persons with advanced cancer, b) their primary FCGs, and c) lay healthcare navigators, develop and tailor the content, format and delivery of a telehealth intervention for FCGs of persons with advanced cancer in the rural South. To meet the K99 training objectives, a comprehensive training plan has been developed in concert with an interdisciplinary mentorship and consultant team of senior research experts. The plan includes intensive one-on-one mentorship, formal coursework/workshops, clinical trial research observerships, and conference attendance. The overall goal during the R00 phase is to conduct a pilot RCT with 60 rural Southern advanced cancer FCGs to assess acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of the newly tailored FCG intervention resulting from the K99 phase. The research specific aims during the R00 phase are to: 1) evaluate the acceptability of a newly tailored FCG intervention and the feasibility of enrolling and retaining 60 participants into a RCT of the FCG intervention for 24 weeks and 2) evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in improving caregiver outcomes (quality of life, burden, and mood [depression/anxiety]) compared to usual care. The results will directly support an R-01 application to conduct an efficacy RCT of an early, telehealth PC intervention for rural Southern FCGs of advanced cancer patients.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden placed on family caregivers and the toll on their mental and physical health have never been greater and will continue to rise; by 2020 the number of individuals with cancer is expected to swell by 31% from 13 million to over 18 million and the number of individuals with cancer who are in their last year of life is expected to increase from 901,000 to 1,217,000. Healthcare clinicians should be concerned with the health of family caregivers for their own sake (e.g. preventing future family caregiver morbidity), but also because these caregivers deliver 80% of the home care to community-dwelling patients with advanced illness. Replacing these services with paid professional help would be economically unfeasible as caregiving services have been valued at $450 billion; thus it is imperative that interventions be developed that keep FCGs healthy and functioning, not only for their own sake, but also so they can provide the best care possible to patients with cancer.",2019,242492,163294,79198,Non-SBIR/STTR,R00,National Institute of Nursing Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF NURSING,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Caregiving Research; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Depression; Mental Health; Rural Health,James N.

5F31HD094539-02,Immunogenetic Determinants of Chlamydia Reinfection and Chlamydia-Associated Infertility in Women,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The purpose of this NIH F31-Diversity application is to obtain support for the PI, Kristin Olson, for
mentored research and career development activities within her MD/PhD degree training that will strengthen her
potential to become a successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in statistical genetics
that will allow the PI to study the influence of immunogenetic determinants on Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)
infection outcomes in women, including methods of genetic data quality control, imputation, multiple testing
corrections, and pathway analyses. The primary objective of the research proposal is to investigate the
immunogenetic determinants of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) reinfection and CT-associated infertility in women.
CT infection is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide, including in the U.S. CT
disproportionately affects women due to the reproductive morbidity it causes. Up to 20% of women experience
reinfection after treatment and inflammation from repeated CT infection episodes can contribute to risk for CT-
associated infertility. It is unknown why some women remain susceptible to CT after treatment, leading to
reinfection, and why some CT infections lead to infertility. This project seeks to determine genetic risk markers
for CT reinfection and CT-related infertility (Aims 1A and 2A), and then utilize complex statistical methods to
predict the immune responses mediated by these genetic markers (Aims 1B and 2B). The central hypothesis is
that genetic factors influence risk for these CT infection outcomes through specific immunological pathways, and
some genetic factors may contribute to both clinical outcomes while others may be unique for only one of the
clinical outcomes. The long-term objective of our research is to understand immunogenetic factors that influence
CT infection outcomes in order to develop strategies for improving prevention and management of CT infection,
such as optimizing chlamydia screening strategies and development of a chlamydia vaccine.
 The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her project co-mentors, Dr. William Geisler and Dr.
Hemant Tiwari. Included in the training plan are experiences that help the PI develop in three major areas: 1)
rigorous research in the CT field, including developing familiarity with the existing CT literature, critically
evaluating published CT studies, principles of scientific integrity and responsible conduct of research, and
methods of rigor and reproducibility; 2) statistical genetics, including methodology and interpretation of results;
and 3) career and professional development, including learning skills in grant writing, journal reviewing,
presenting, and translation of research findings to clinical applications. The overall goal of the training plan is to
provide the PI with a solid foundation for a successful career as a physician scientist, with the ultimate career
goal of leading a collaborative research team that bridges the gap between laboratory-based research and
systems-based research in the context of improving reproductive health outcomes for women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial infection worldwide, is

5T32HL007457-39,Mechanisms of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Training Program, Mechanisms of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases, Suzanne Oparil, MD, PD/PI, offers multidisciplinary postdoctoral training in fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension and related cardiovascular disease (CVD), in innovative approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions and in translating basic and clinical research findings to the population level. This Training Program advances the spectrum of available training in the following Thematic Focus Areas: Basic Science (fundamental training in mechanisms of inflammatory vascular injury and repair and oxidative stress/free radical injury; T0); Translational Science (translation-to-humans,
early clinical trials, testing basic science discoveries for clinical applicability; T1-T2) Clinica Science (research to improve knowledge of new therapies, medical applications and clinical interventions; T2-T3), and Population Science (clinical trials to wide-spread evidence-based practice that improves the overall public health; T3-T4).  Faculty Mentors offer training in these rapidly evolving research areas: behavioral, epidemiologic and population/prevention research, state-of-the-art clinical trials, comparative effectiveness research, biostatistics/quantitative sciences, genomics, health disparities research, other-""Omics"", and regenerative and reparative medicine. Trainees will have a 2-3 year experience in laboratory, clinical/translational or population- based research under the mentorship of T32 Program Faculty Mentors. Trainees will spend at least 80% of time in investigation, coursework, and in career development activities. The goal of this Program is to prepare trainees for careers in fundamental, clinical, translational and population-based research in hypertension and CVD. The educational experiences available to our trainees will equip them with the technical skills and theoretical background needed to make them competitive for faculty positions in prestigious academic institutions, in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry or in health care delivery research.  An
important goal of this Training Program is to build productive, efficient, and cutting edge interdisciplinary research and training programs. Thus, this Program and its Faculty Mentors partner with the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). The mission of the UAB CCTS is to transform UAB's environment by building interdisciplinary research teams through educational ingenuity, regulatory reorganization, resource coordination, and methodological innovation. The UAB CCTS is one of 62 nationwide CTSA Centers, and the ONLY CTSA Program in Alabama.  Relevance: There is a shortage of basic, translational, clinical and population scientists trained to use cutting edge approaches to problems related to hypertension and CVD, a leading cause of death and disability in the US. This is the only Training Program in Alabama that provides highly integrated ""bench to bedside"" postdoctoral training. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States (US) is steadily increasing, in part due to the aging of the US population, increased prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and the metabolic syndrome and the emergence of high-risk populations, i.e., racial/ethnic minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, and persons infected with HIV/AIDS. These increasing health needs underscore the importance of training basic scientists, clinical scientists and population scientists in an environment conduciv to multidisciplinary team research in order to test more effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of hypertension and related vascular disease and other comorbidities. This Training Program addresses these goals, and is the only postdoctoral Training Program in the state of Alabama with a primary focus on hypertension and CVD. (End of Abstract)","NARRATIVE

1R13HL147538-01,30th Annual Vascular Biology and Hypertension Symposium,"ABSTRACT SUMMARY
 The goal of the 30th Annual Vascular Biology and Hypertension (VB&H) Symposium to be held at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) on Thursday, May 2 â€“ Saturday, May 4, 2019 is to
disseminate knowledge used to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from hypertension (HTN) and
related diseases and to improve the quality of life for patients. HTN is the most prevalent modifiable risk
factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States (US), and is a particularly serious problem in the
Southeast US, including Alabama, where it is highly prevalent (1,2). To prevent and control HTN in the Southeast
US, implementation of strategies to detect and manage HTN and related comorbidities are critical.
 The 2019 VB&H Symposium is highly responsive to evolving healthcare needs and the necessity for
innovative approaches to train basic, translational, clinical and population scientists and healthcare providers
and will provide up-to-date information to improve HTN detection and manage and prevent CVD throughout the
Southeastern US. The 2019 VB&H Symposium will also create a scientific environment capable of
promoting the 2016 NHLBI Strategic Vision Mission (3) by reporting on: 1) newly discovered pathobiological
mechanisms of HTN and related CVD, 2) factors that account for differences in health among populations, 3)
novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat and possibly cure HTN and related CVD, and 4)
clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease.
 The 2019 VB&H Symposium will enhance participation from physicians, nurse practitioners, and other
healthcare providers from rural areas surrounding Birmingham, Alabama (the Black Belt) that serve
predominantly underrepresented minority patients with low socioeconomic status. Day 1 (Thursday, May 2,
2019) is the inaugural Interactive Workshop on Hypertension that provides a foundation on HTN pathogenesis,
epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment. Day 2 (Friday, May 3, 2019) includes formal presentations on the
molecular mechanisms of HTN and novel diagnostic procedures and treatments for HTN. Day 2 also includes the
Data Blitz Sessions and VB&H Annual Poster Session. Day 3 (Saturday, May 4, 2019) includes sessions on BP
measurement and the latest findings of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). The format of
the 2019 VB&H Symposium will facilitate interaction between trainees, healthcare providers (from rural primary
care practices in Alabama), and basic, clinical and population scientists. It will feature 17 speakers (11 external,
6 internal), as well as participation from these speakers and engaged UAB faculty in the Interactive Workshop
on Hypertension. The 2019 VB&H Symposium is highly significant because it will introduce cutting edge
multidisciplinary science on HTN and CVD to a diverse audience of healthcare providers, scientists and
trainees from the Southeast. This shared knowledge will be readily translatable to improving HTN
detection and management and in preventing CVD in this underserved region of the US.","NARRATIVE

1R21AI146149-01,Pneumococcal biofilm formation is SpxB dependent,"ABSTRACT:
Biofilm formation is a key aspect of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) pathogenesis. Spn in biofilms have been
detected in diverse anatomical sites and shown to contribute to Spn transmission and virulence. Despite this,
the environmental cues and regulatory pathways responsible for Spn biofilm formation remain unknown. Our
recent studies have shown that streptococcal pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), the enzyme that converts pyruvate to
acetyl phosphate and in doing so produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is required for Spn biofilm formation.
The goal of this project is to determine if Spn biofilm formation is the downstream result of a metabolic profile
associated with excess acetyl phosphate, the result of a transcriptional response to H2O2, or a combination of
both. We will:
AIM 1. Determine if acetyl phosphate is required for Spn biofilm formation. Acetyl phosphate is converted
to acetyl-CoA which then serves as substrate for acetylated capsular polysaccharide types. In similar fashion,
we hypothesize that the production of key biofilm ECM components depends on the availability of acetyl
phosphate/acetyl-CoA. We will test this by examining the biofilm-forming ability of mutant bacteria unable to
produce acetyl-CoA, determining the impact of exogenous acetate and acetyl-CoA on wildtype and mutant
bacteria, and identifying the metabolic changes that occur during in vitro biofilm formation under distinct acetyl-
phosphate level growth conditions.
AIM 2. Determine if H2O2 is a quorum signal for Spn biofilm formation. Spn has a two-component signal
transduction system, CiaRH, which is responsive to oxygen and is required for biofilm formation. Based upon
findings that show the oxidative state of CiaRH impacts its activity within oral streptococci, we hypothesize that
H2O2 is an environmental cue that accumulates and promotes Spn biofilm formation at the transcriptional level.
We will test this by examining biofilm formation and gene transcription in mutant bacteria unable to produce
H2O2, following treatment of Spn with antioxidants, under anaerobic conditions or with exogenous H2O2 added,
and by examining a mutant deficient in CiaRH.
Work proposed in this R21 will identify the molecular mechanisms that underlay Spn biofilm formation.
Knowledge obtained may identify novel targets for prevention or treatment of Spn disease. Findings made as
part of the proposed work will serve as the basis of a future R01 that investigates how the identified SpxB-
derived molecules drive biofilm formation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

5R01AI114800-05,Cardiac microlesion formation during invasive pneumococcal disease,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1/5 of adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experience cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and/or myocardial infarction and this contributes substantially to mortality. We have made the novel and seminal observation that Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of CAP, can enter the myocardium during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and forms microscopic vacuolar lesions (i.e. microlesions) filled with extracellular pneumococci. In mice with IPD, cardiac microlesion formation was concomitant with aberrant cardiac electrophysiology indicative of ongoing heart failure. In stark contrast to cardiac infections caused by other bacteria, S. pneumoniae cardiac microlesion formation is remarkable due to the complete absence of infiltrated immune cells. Why this occurs is unknown, yet the lack of a host response is undoubtedly permissive for heart damage. We hypothesize that S. pneumoniae forms an immunoquiescent biofilm within the cardiac microlesion. Our preliminary results support this notion and demonstrate that biofilm S. pneumoniae (BF-Spn) does not incite NFÎºB activation from host cells nor results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our goal is to discern
the host-pathogen interactions that occur during cardiac microlesion formation and identify targets for intervention. Aim 1: Determine the requirement for biofilm formation during pneumococcal cardiac microlesion formation. We will examine cardiac microlesions for the presence of biofilm extracellular matrix components and test isolated S. pneumoniae for the biofilm phenotype. We will test the ability of S. pneumoniae mutants deficient in the ability to form biofilms in vitro for their ability to form cardiac microlesions in vivo. We will compare the cytokine and chemokine response of cardiomyocytes exposed to planktonic (P-Spn) and BF-Spn. This aim will directly test if S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions are in an immunoquiescent biofilm. Aim 2: Characterize S. pneumoniae within cardiac microlesions and identify novel virulence determinants required for their formation. Using RNA-sequencing we will characterize and then compare the gene expression profile of S. pneumoniae in cardiac microlesions to those in the blood of infected mice. Genes with high in vivo gene expression will be deleted and isogenic mutants tested for the ability to cause cardiac microlesions. This aim will characterize how S. pneumoniae adapts to growth within the heart and identify in an unbiased manner targets for intervention. Aim 3: Characterize the cardiomyocyte response to pneumolysin exposure. We will measure the cytokine/chemokine response and susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to pneumolysin, the S. pneumoniae pore forming toxin, and bacterial cell wall. We will test if S. pneumoniae activates the NLRP3 inflammasome within cardiomyocytes. We will determine if sub-lytic levels of pneumolysin trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. This aim will discern if cardiomyocytes exposed to S. pneumoniae undergo a cell death program that is not inflammatory.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for >1.5 million deaths annually; many of which are the result of an adverse cardiac event during infection. We have made the seminal observation that cardiac lesions filled with bacteria form in the heart during S. pneumoniae infection and this is associated with heart failure. This proposal seeks to examine the host-pathogen interactions that occur during cardiac lesion formation and to identify potential targets for intervention.,2019,361860,250000,111860,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza,Carlos J Orihuela
5R01NS105438-02,Inhibitory Neural Circuits in Dentate Function,"The dentate gyrus contributes to hippocampal memory encoding by transforming dense cortical patterns of
sensory and spatial information into sparse neural representations of specific contexts. Diverse local inhibitory
circuits are essential for this process, maintaining low levels of neural activity wherein only small fractions of
principal neurons are active at any given time. The dentate gyrus also continually generates new neurons
throughout life, providing a substrate for adult brain plasticity through experience-dependent construction of
new circuits. It is well established that GABA receptor-mediated mechanisms tightly regulate proliferation and
functional integration of adult-born neurons. Thus, GABAergic interneurons provide both inhibitory control of
mature dentate neurons and regulate the production of adult-born neurons. The goal of this project is to
determine how a highly abundant subtype of GABAergic interneuron contributes to both inhibitory and
neurogenic functions in the dentate gyrus. This family of interneurons called Ivy/Neurogliaform cells (INGs) has
been relatively neglected due to the inability to selectively target them using genetic approaches. We will
address this roadblock by validating new tools to identify and manipulate INGs, and compare their functions
with the highly-studied parvalbumin (PV)- expressing fast-spiking interneurons. These fast and slow-spiking
interneuron subtypes have highly divergent anatomical, intrinsic and synaptic properties, suggesting that they
play distinct roles in dentate inhibition and neurogenesis. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
slow-spiking INGs use GABAA and GABAB receptor activation to enforce sparse yet high-fidelity
spiking of mature GCs as well as regulate early stages of dentate neurogenesis. We will combine cellular
and circuit level analysis with optogenetic approaches to assess the role of slow spiking interneurons in both
inhibition and neurogenesis. After understanding the cellular properties of slow-spiking interneurons subtypes,
we will dissect their role in controlling GC inhibition and spike timing, comparing with results from fast-spiking
interneurons. We will use optogenetic silencing to determine the respective interneuron contributions to
dentate excitability with a focus on GABAB mediated-inhibition and interactions between slow and fast-spiking
subtypes. Finally, we will test the role of slow-spiking interneurons in stem cell proliferation, and the
contribution of GABAB receptor-mediating inhibition in differential excitability of young and mature GCs. The
results of these studies will provide fundamental insight into the function of slow-spiking interneurons in dentate
excitability and neurogenesis.","Project Narrative

2R01NS064025-10,Newborn Neurons in the Adult Hippocampal Network,"The dentate gyrus contributes to hippocampal memory encoding by transforming dense cortical
patterns of sensory and spatial information into sparse neural representations of specific contexts. There is
now overwhelming evidence that continual adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in important for the ability
to discriminate spatial contexts, but it is not clear how newly generated neurons contribute to dentate circuit
function. Most theories have focused on the fact that newly-generated immature neurons have distinct
physiological properties that potentially endow them with unique processing capabilities compared to larger
population of mature neurons. Alternatively, an emerging idea is that adult-born neurons promote wide-spread
plasticity of the pre-existing cortical-dentate circuit by modifying the function of existing neurons in a manner
that promotes sparse activity. This could occur either by indirect circuit actions like feedback inhibition, as well
as via direct interactions with existing excitatory synaptic connectivity. We recently showed that selectively
increasing the number of adult-born neurons in mouse dentate gyrus reduces the excitatory synaptic
connectivity of mature neurons, resulting in both functional and anatomical changes in entorhinal-dentate
circuitry. These results and existing literature support a model wherein a static pool of cortical pre-synaptic
terminals is dynamically distributed between newly integrating adult-born neurons and developmentally-
generated mature neurons. The goal of this project is to test the overarching hypothesis that synaptic
integration of adult-born neurons has disproportionate effects on circuit function via redistribution of
cortical synaptic connectivity. First, we will map and quantify the presynaptic changes that accompany
neurogenesis-induced loss of cortical synapses with mature neurons. Second, we will test the prediction that
availability of cortical presynaptic terminals is a limiting factor in the integration of newborn GCs that potentially
contributes to the reduced rate new neuron maturation across adulthood. Finally, we will test potential
consequences of synaptic redistribution on the sparsity of neural activity and synaptic plasticity, and the
requirement for synaptic redistribution for neurogenesis-sensitive behaviors. We will use a combination of viral
manipulations, electrophysiology, imaging and behavioral analysis to test the prediction that synaptic re-
distribution limits the integration of adult-born neurons during adulthood and sparsifies neural activity, as well
as contributes to behaviors that are sensitive to neurogenesis. Together our results will generate fundamental
new knowledge about the role of neurogenesis in cortical-dentate circuitry, and potentially provide insight into
how this circuit changes across adulthood as neurogenesis declines. Understanding how neurogenesis
contributes to hippocampal function is important for devising strategies to counteract the consequences of
disrupted neurogenesis that occurs during aging and many neurological conditions.","The goal of this project is to understand how new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus contribute to

5R01DK108438-05,Effect of Pitavastatin on Kidney Function in HIV-infected Persons,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effect of Pitavastatin on Renal Function in HIV-infected Persons on stable ART Despite advances in antiretroviral treatment (ART) and the reduction in AIDS-related opportunistic infections, HIV-infected persons have persistent systemic inflammation that contributes to end organ diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both traditional (older age, black race, hypertension, diabetes) and HIV-related (chronic viral infection, immunosuppression, inflammation, excess oxidative stress, ART toxicities) factors have been demonstrated to contribute to CKD in the setting of HIV infection. HMG-coA reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) not only reduce LDL cholesterol but also exert potent anti-inflammatory effects that may be relevant to prevent the progression of kidney disease in diseases like HIV infection which is characterized by heightened inflammation. In this proposal, we will leverage the infrastructure of the NIH-funded REPRIEVE trial in which 6,500 HIV-infected participants with eGFR >60ml/min/1.73m2 will be randomized to 4mg pitavastatin or placebo to reduce the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. In an effort to streamline the study, measures of kidney function are not routinely performed. By adding collection of urine and blood from annual visits in 2,500 participants, we propose to assess whether pitavastatin therapy can prevent a â‰¥30% eGFR decline, a recommended surrogate endpoint for CKD, and the development of albuminuria (ACR >30mg/g). We will also evaluate the effect of pitavastatin in sub-groups of HIV-infected participants for whom the risk of CKD has been demonstrated to be higher, including persons of older age, black race, hypertension, lower CD4 T cell counts, and on tenofovir-containing regimens. Finally, we will assess whether the protective effect of pitavastatin is mediated through mechanistic pathways involving inflammation and oxidative stress. Ultimately, the findings of this study will provide longitudinal
data on the epidemiology of CKD in the setting of HIV infection, provide mechanistic insights into whether statins prevent CKD by modulating inflammation and oxidative stress, and potentially change guidelines for the prevention of CKD in this at risk population.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains more common in persons with HIV compared to the general population.

1R01EY029595-01A1,Functionally Validated Structural Endpoints for Early AMD,"Project Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of irreversible vision impairment in the US
and third globally, is a disease of the photoreceptor support system involving the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE), Bruch's membrane, and the choriocapillaris, ultimately leading to photoreceptor
demise and eventual vision loss. Our research with that of others has clearly documented the selective
vulnerability of rod photoreceptors and rod-mediated (scotopic) vision, including delayed rod-mediated
dark adaptation (RMDA) and impaired rod-mediated light sensitivity, in aging and early AMD. RMDA is
not only more likely to be slower in eyes with early AMD compared to eyes in normal macular health, but
also delayed RMDA is a functional biomarker (i.e., risk factor) for incident early AMD. The next frontier
is to establish the structural basis of rod-mediated dysfunction in older adults at-risk for AMD and those
already converted to early AMD. Our unifying hypothesis across all aims is: Early AMD is a disease of
micronutrient deficiency and vascular insufficiency, due to detectable structural changes in the retinoid
re-supply route from the choriocapillaris to the photoreceptors, manifest functionally as delayed rod-
mediated dark adaptation. These structural disturbances will occur in specific chorioretinal layers and
regions reflecting the spatial distribution of disease in the photoreceptor support system. Our
multidisciplinary team has expertise in visual psychophysics, epidemiology, histopathology, digital image
analysis and interpretation for retinal disease, study design, and biostatistics. Toward our goals, we will
execute the 3 specific aims in an exceptionally well phenotyped cohort at aging-early AMD transition,
staged by the AREDS 9-step scale, with 3 years of longitudinal follow-up: (1) To examine the abundance
and extent of AMD's pathognomonic deposits (drusen and newly recognized subretinal drusenoid
deposits) in relationship to scotopic dysfunction via optical coherence tomography (OCT); (2) To
examine RPE cell bodies as structural correlates of scotopic dysfunction via quantitative fundus
autofluorescence and layer thicknesses via OCT; (3) To measure vascular density (coverage of macular
Bruch's membrane by choriocapillaris), a measure of exchange capacity for outer retinal cells, using OCT
angiography. An accurate map and timeline of structure-function relationships in aging and early AMD
gained from our research, especially the critical transition from aging to disease, will help define major
effects that can be developed into future treatments and preventative measures. Our data will help define
new endpoints for clinical trials for drugs to treat early AMD, the absence of which has impeded
translational research on this prevalent cause of legal blindness. Endpoints are needed more than ever,
because causal treatments targeting lipids in drusen and BrM can be pressed forward, thanks to clinical
and pre-clinical proof- of-concept studies.","Project Narrative

1R15GM132803-01,Singlet oxygen formation vs. photodissociation for protic ruthenium anticancer compounds: The oxygenated substituent determines the mode of action and the cytotoxicity,"Abstract. Metallodrugs are commonly prescribed to treat cancer, but they have significant off target effects
because they kill all quickly dividing cells, including healthy cells. There is a need for new targeted therapies.
Light activated ruthenium (Ru) based drugs are promising because they allow for spatial and temporal control of
drug activation using the FDA approved technique of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Three Ru based prodrugs
have recently entered clinical trials, showing the promise of this approach. New protic Ru complexes have been
synthesized and studied which demonstrate light activation and selective toxicity towards breast cancer cells vs.
normal cells. Light activation of Ru complexes can generate toxic species by two pathways. 1) Photodissociation
of a ligand can generate free ligand and ruthenium with free sites which are both potentially toxic species; this is
known as photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). 2) Alternatively, light driven singlet oxygen generation (via PDT)
can lead to oxidative stress and cell death. The aim of this application is to determine the factors that lead to
light activated toxicity in new protic Ru photochemotherapy (PCT) agents including whether a PACT vs. PDT
process occurs. The long-term goal of this work is to design highly cytotoxic and selective prodrugs that are
initially inert but transform into active drugs in the presence of tissue penetrating red light. These prodrugs can
target cancer cells due to a combination of enhanced uptake and high levels of oxidative stress present in
cancerous cells. Three hypotheses motivate this work. First, protic OH groups on the ligand lead to neutral
molecules at physiological pH which can enhance uptake of Ru PCT agents. These OH groups also shift light
absorption to longer wavelengths upon deprotonation. Second, the substituent on the ligand determines whether
photodissociation vs. singlet oxygen generation occurs upon light activation, which determines the resulting
toxicity. Third, breast cancer cells are effectively targeted because of the inherent vulnerability of cancer cells to
reactive oxygen species (including singlet oxygen). Three specific aims will probe these hypotheses. 1)
Determine how substituent changes control the biological mode of action of Ru PCT agents and their cytotoxicity.
2) Elucidate the mechanism of preferential toxicity towards breast tumor cells. 3) Synthetically design new Ru
PCT agents to maximize cytotoxicity and cellular uptake and to red shift light absorption. The proposed research
will establish a new generation of Ru PCT agents with selective toxicity towards breast cancer cells and other
susceptible cell types. The major innovation of our project is in the rational design of a new class of PCT agents
with ideal photophysical, photochemical, biological, and chemical properties. There is potentially a high impact
for drug developers beyond the oncology field, in that we are elucidating how protic ligands impact uptake and
photodissociation vs. singlet oxygen formation, and this can be used to target other diseases. This project will
also be used to train a group of undergraduate and graduate students in biological and chemical collaborative
anticancer research.","Project Narrative: The proposed research is relevant to public health because we are elucidating the factors
that contribute to the formation of highly selective metallo prodrugs that can target cancer cells and be used
with photodynamic therapy. Our strategy will elucidate how to control the generation of toxic species and
determine which types of cancer are most vulnerable to our ruthenium photochemotherapy agents, and this
strategy can have a transformative impact by minimizing the deadly side effects associated with
chemotherapy. We are also targeting cancer stem cells through this approach, through which we aim to
learn how to block tumor relapse in patients.",2019,420357,300000,120357,Non-SBIR/STTR,R15,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,AL,TUSCALOOSA,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,354870104,Breast Cancer; Cancer; Radiation Oncology,Elizabeth Tabitha Papish
5R01CA216108-03,Deciphering How Esco2 Loss Acts as a Penetrance Modifier,"Abstract
Li Fraumeni patients, which harbor heterozygous p53 germ line mutation, are highly predisposed to cancers.
The penetrance of these individuals can vary greatly; some individuals have tumor onset prior to age 1, while
some individual that do not present with cancer by age 74. P53 is the most widely mutated gene in sporadic
cancers, therefore understanding the mechanisms that impact tumor penetrance will have great benefit to pre-
dicting individual cancer risk. We have made the unique observation that haploinsufficient Esco2 loss, in both
zebrafish and mouse, accelerated tumor formation in a p53 heterozygous animals, but not p53 wild type or
homozygous null animal. In addition we observe a high proportion of cells in Esco2 heterozygous null animals
to have reduced sister chromatid cohesion (SCC). These observations establish our hypothesis that reduced
SCC results in increased rates of loss of heterozygosity, which accelerates the timing of tumor initiation and
enhanced tumor penetrance. Within this proposal we will address this hypothesis and decipher the mechanism
of how Esco2 loss acts as a penetrance modifier. Aim 1, determine if there are accelerated LOH rates, and the
type/s of genomic instability that drive accelerated tumorigenesis, in tumors from animals with reduced cohe-
sion; Aim 2, determine if the extent of tumor enhancement is dependent on the extent of cohesion dysfunction;
Aim 3, determine if biochemically if reduced acetylation by the cohesion establishment factor, ESCO2 lends to
reduced cohesion and tumor enhancement. The expected overall impact of the proposed work is that it will
fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of a how SCC dysfunction impacts tumorigenesis. This
will serve as the foundation for future therapeutic intervention and predictive biomarkers of cancer risk.","Narrative

1R01GM123971-01A1,Connexin 43 Modulates Regulated Exocytosis,"Abstract
 Astrocyte-neuron signaling, a.k.a. gliotransmission, can modulate synaptic transmission/plasticity at
tripartite synapses. Among the processes regulated by gliotransmission are sleep-regulation, respiration, and
learning/memory. Despite these roles of gliotransmission in such fundamental life processes, its mechanism is
not understood. Elucidating this mechanism should provide insights into basic brain processes, and suggest
interventions when they go awry. Two early studies of astrocyte-neuron signaling explored the hypothesis that
astrocytic glutamate release acts on neuronal glutamate receptors, but they led to different conclusions
regarding the mechanism. One study concluded that glutamate is not the messenger but instead suggested
that gap junctions might mediate astrocyte-neuron signaling. The other study concluded that the signaling is
mediated by Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, subsequently shown to occur by regulated
exocytosis of glutamate-containing vesicles. Virtually nothing is known about the subcellular
distribution/localization of astrocyte release sites. It is not clear if they are localized uniquely to the tripartite
synaptic regions of astrocytes or more broadly. There is much debate about the relative roles of exocytosis vs.
gap junction-mediated communication as critical for astrocyte-neuron signals. Our preliminary data point to a
novel, unifying hypothesis that these two mechanisms are, in fact, mechanistically linked.","Narrative

The Developmental funds of the CCSG represent a vital component of the UAB-CCC Core grant by
empowering the Center Director to respond to and provide leadership for the strategic scientific needs and

are combined with other Center funds (e.g., gift account) and funds from departments and other Centers to
provide attractive recruitment packages for faculty important to the Cancer Center's research enterprise.
These recruitments may represent an enhancement of a new research initiative, expansion of an existing
program or replacement of departing or retiring faculty. During the current cycle the recruited investigators
have been awarded over $1.9M in extramural funding. The second use of these funds is for our Pilot Grant
Program with an emphasis on young or new faculty and inter- and intra-programmatic collaborative research
programs and seed funding for multi-project grants such as SPOREs and P01s. The CCC contributes to 3-4
junior faculty grants in collaboration with our American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant. Our
Scientific Advisory Committee reviews and critiques these applications for Cancer Center research priorities
and potential for extramural funding. The recipients of these funds have an excellent track record of successful
grant funding (more than $4.1M in extramural direct costs) and adding to the scientific growth of our programs.
Third, development funding is used to invest in new research technologies that the Center membership find of
significant value yet cannot afford to implement individually. This investment manifests itself as expansion of
the capabilities of a current shared facility or the creation of a developing shared facilities centered on the new

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new pre-doctoral training grant application in Translational and Molecular Sciences (TMS) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Currently, too few PhD graduates are entering the workforce with sufficient training in pathobiology of disease and translational experiences to effectively translate molecular advances into clinical practice. This proposal addresses this need with our goal being to provide a training environment that provides the necessary skills for the next generation of PhD biomedical scientists to incorporate translational objectives into their research and prepare them for the workforce of tomorrow. Our recent experiences in graduate education show increased demand from students for training in translational research; this is the driving force behind the current application. A major challenge in effective training in translational sciences for pre-doctoral students is the need to incorporate multiple disciplines and concepts ranging from understanding disease mechanisms, understanding of how findings may be translated in academia or industry, to understanding regulatory oversight procedures and rules. We propose a 2 year program (with 6 students per year) with students enrolling at the beginning of their second year. An integrative curriculum is proposed that involves didactic elements (that includes understanding disease mechanisms, drug discovery and development, translational research administration), career and translational research enrichment activities (including enrollment in a
Certificate program in Translational and Molecular Sciences, academia and industry workshops, CTSA interactions, Eminent Speaker Series) and meaningful clinical / patient interaction experiences, the latter of which will be linked with the trainees' research interests. We feel that
providing students with training in translational research early during a student's matriculation will provide required skills and empower them intellectually to incorporate translational research into their research and prepare them for the diverse requirements for the future workforce. To achieve this, we have assembled 42 training faculty with well-funded laboratories and a unique array of expertise (45% PhD, 45% MD, and 10% MD PhD) and experience whose collective research addresses fundamental scientific problems with a strong emphasis on translation and human disease. An additional goal of this program will be to involve more MDs in graduate training and education. Several disease areas that are perennial strengths of UAB and integrated with clinical and basic science departments, together with UAB Centers are represented and will provide breadth for students in diverse research disciplines. This proposal underscores our previous and ongoing commitment to pre-doctoral education and our collective goal of providing an environment for students to learn and develop the skills they will require to be successful in the biomedical research and other science related occupations.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Translational and Molecular Sciences Training Program will provide a focus on translational research training for PhD graduate students.

1F32HL146179-01,Circadian Control of Endothelial Function in Mice On a High Fat Diet,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity is a major independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Both human and
animal studies demonstrate that a chronic high fat diet (HFD) leads to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability
and endothelial dysfunction. The cycles of feeding and fasting are known to influence the risk for obesity,
cardiovascular, and cardiometabolic disease. Ad libitum chronic HFD disrupts the normal circadian rhythm in
metabolism and molecular clock gene rhythm in mice. However, specific circadian-dependent mechanisms
affecting the endothelium during chronic HFD are poorly understood. Endothelial function under normal
activity is known to follow a circadian rhythm peaking during the active period. The mechanisms underlying
endothelial dysfunction mediated from loss of circadian rhythms in metabolism remain unknown, and these
studies will be beneficial to understand how disruption of metabolic rhythms may lead to circadian dysfunction.
A large number of drugs target circadian genes and may be influenced by timing. Chronotherapy is the timing
of medications to be synchronized with circadian rhythms to optimize treatment and may be beneficial for
treatment of cardiometabolic disease. A better understanding of the circadian-dependent mechanisms leading
to endothelial dysfunction and loss of NO bioavailability is necessary for the development of improved
therapies or to optimize timing of current therapies.","Project Narrative

5P01CA229997-02,Project 3: Simultaneous Combined Or Sequential (S.O.S.) Approaches to Behavior Change for Survivors,"Health risks (poor diet, excess weight, physical inactivity) in rising numbers of cancer survivors represent a 
substantial public health concern and can lead to second primaries and cancer recurrence, as well as other 
comorbidities and functional decline. Effective behavioral interventions are needed for this population. Studies 
to date have largely addressed individual lifestyle behaviors as independent factors, but there often are 
multiple health risks that require attention amongst survivors. Thus, intervening upon multiple modifiable risk 
factors is much more likely to impact public health than intervening on a single behavior. Multiple behavior 
change interventions have shown success in the general population, as well as promising results in the few 
available studies in cancer survivors. However, several gaps in this research remain. First, there is no 
consensus on the best approach to multiple behavior change and the few studies that have compared 
simultaneous vs. sequential multiple behavior interventions yielded mixed findings. Clarifying best practices for 
multiple behavior change has important clinical implications and will be key to moving the field forward. 
Second, this line of research has yet to be fully extended to at risk populations. As noted, there have been 
some multiple behavior change studies conducted in cancer survivors, but none have examined simultaneous 
vs. sequential intervention approaches and most involved predominantly younger, well-educated White 
samples. The National Cancer Institute has called for multiple behavior change research in underserved 
populations, i.e., survivors of various cancers who also are rural, older and minority. Thus, the proposed 
Project 3, which builds upon Projects 1-2 of AMPLIFI, will test the efficacy of simultaneous vs. sequential 
interventions targeting diet, weight loss, and/or exercise, and explore which combination or order is best to 
maximize change for cancer survivors. The study will use a randomized controlled design with 652 cancer 
survivors from mostly older, rural, and minority groups. Primary aims include determining the relative efficacy 
of two approaches (simultaneous vs. sequenced) to multiple health behavior change, with meeting behavioral 
goals (improved diet quality, 3% weight loss, â‰¥150 weekly minutes of â‰¥moderate intensity physical activity) 
post-intervention as endpoints of interest. Secondary aims include examining maintenance of gains at 6 
months post-intervention and arm differences in physical activity and function, lean body mass, quality of life, 
and biomarkers of successful aging, immune status, and systemic inflammation; identifying potential mediators 
(SCT constructs) and moderators (education) of intervention efficacy; and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of 
sequenced vs. simultaneous technology-based interventions. This will be one of the largest trials ever to 
compare sequential vs. simultaneous interventions. Findings will be of high public health impact given the 
diversity and high risk nature of the patient population.","PROJECT 3

. Yet, most
Americans are inactive, particularly in the Deep South. Cancer incidence/mortality is also generally higher in
this region, with underserved (rural, African American) populations reporting even less PA and disproportionate
cancer burden. Factors related to culture, distance from PA facilities, income, literacy, and Internet connectivity
in the Deep South may limit access to PA information/resources and contribute to existing cancer disparities.
Telephone-supported interventions have shown success in increasing PA, do not require clinic visits, literacy,
or costly technology, and thus may represent a promising strategy for promoting PA for cancer risk reduction in
the Deep South, especially when automated with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems for improved cost-
effectiveness and reach. Thus, we adapted an existing IVR system, used in past HIV studies, for PA promotion
and cancer prevention in the Deep South through extensive literature review and formative research [11 focus
groups on PA intervention needs/preferences with Deep South Network For Cancer Control community health
advisors (CHAs) and community members]. A pilot trial of the resulting Deep south IVR-supported Active
Lifestyle (DIAL) intervention!(R03CA177538) found high retention and participant satisfaction at 12 weeks.
Moreover, DIAL produced larger increases in MVPA (42.5 more min/week) from baseline to 12 weeks than a

5R01DK104924-03,Hypercalciuria and TRPV6-mediated Active Calcium Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypercalciuria occurs in 5-10% of the population and is the most common cause of calcium (Ca) kidney stone
disease. Ca reabsorption takes place in different nephron segments; however, evidence from human subjects
indicates that proximal tubule Ca reabsorption is decreased in stone formers. Furthermore, studies in both
animals and humans suggest that increased proximal tubule Ca reabsorption accounts for the hypocalciuric
effect of thiazide diuretics, the first line medication for hypercalciuria. Compared to Ca reabsorption in the distal
tubule, much less is known about the mechanism of Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Lines of evidence
from classical physiological studies indicate the existence of an active Ca transport pathway in the proximal
straight tubule, the last portion of the proximal tubule where Ca can be reabsorbed before tubular fluid enters the
loop of Henle where supersaturation of Ca phosphate may occur due to water extraction. Active Ca reabsorption
in this segment of the nephron may remove Ca in the tubular fluid to a level below that in the plasma. The
objective of this proposal is to elucidate the roles of a novel active Ca transport pathway in the proximal straight
tubule in causing and treating hypercalciuria. The central hypothesis is that active Ca reabsorption in the
proximal tubule is disrupted by postprandial insulin surge and under hyperinsulinemia and is enhanced by
thiazides. In addition, a Ca channel in the apical side of proximal straight tubule may act as a Ca sensor to
regulate overall Ca homeostasis. It has been shown that postprandial insulin secretion and Ca excretion are both
increased in hypercalciuric stone formers. Our preliminary studies indicate that TRPV6, a key Ca channel in the
transcellular Ca transport pathway, is distributed to the proximal straight tubule, and TRPV6 activity is inhibited by
insulin, and the hypocalciuric effect of hydrochlorothiazide is significantly reduced in TRPV6 null mice. These
observations support our hypothesis, which implies that inhibition of TRPV6 by insulin contributes to postprandial
hypercalciuria and hypercalciuria due to compensatory hyperinsulinemia as a result of insulin resistance. We will
test our hypothesis and achieve our research objective by pursuing the following specific aims. 1. Determine the
inhibitory effect of insulin on active Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule. 2. Determine to what extent TRPV6
mediates the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides. 3. Determine the Ca-sensor roles of TRPV6 in the proximal
straight tubule that regulate vitamin D synthesis and paracellular Ca transport. Approaches ranging from Ca
influx in human proximal tubule cells to metabolic studies using TRPV6 null mice will be employed to accomplish
our research goals. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to unveil the molecular
mechanism for the active Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule that regulates Ca reabsorption and Ca
homeostasis. The inhibition of the active Ca reabsorption by insulin provides a molecular basis for the
postprandial hypercalciuria in many stone formers and elevated Ca excretion in prediabetes. These outcomes
will help to develop a new strategy to prevent hypercalciuria and kidney stone disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5F31DE028164-02,Tunable co-delivery of VEGF and BMP2 mimetic peptides to enhance bone regeneration,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current bone grafting materials such as allograft and alloplast have limited osteoinductivity. The proposed
research aims to reintroduce bone-healing factors to these materials to improve bone regeneration. Our group
has identified a polyglutamate domain that can be added to growth factor mimetic peptides to control the binding
and release of the peptides from calcium-containing bone grafting materials. In the proposed research, we will
use variable-length polyglutamate domains (E2, E4, & E7) to create a gradient release of the proangiogenic QK
peptide (angiogenic signaling domain of VEGF) known as PGM-QK from bone grafts. We hypothesize that the
controlled release of PGM-QK will increase vascularization within the implant site, thereby improving bone
regeneration. In addition to PGM-QK peptide delivery, we will investigate the co-delivery of PGM-QK with the
osteogenic peptide, E7-BMP2pep. In previous studies, E7-BMP2pep delivered on grafting material was able to
localize within the injury site and induce an osteogenic response comparable to rBMP-2, without any deleterious
side effects. We propose that co-delivery of these two therapeutics on bone grafts will greatly enhance new bone
synthesis. In this proposal, there are two major objectives: (1) develop a gradient release of PGM-QK from bone
grafts to induce angiogenesis, and (2) co-deliver PGM-QK and E7-BMP2pep on bone grafting materials to
accelerate bone regeneration.
AIM 1: Use of PGM-QK peptides to stimulate angiogenic endothelial cell behavior.
Aim 1 will develop a gradient release of PGM-QK from bone grafting materials to elicit proangiogenic endothelial
cell responses including migration and tubule formation. As well, graft materials with PGM-QK will be evaluated
for angiogenic potential using the chorioallantoic membrane assay. We postulate that controlled release of PGM-
QK peptide from grafting materials will elicit greater neovascularization compared with rVEGF and QK peptide.
AIM 2: Co-delivery of PGM-QK and E7-BMP2pep peptides to stimulate bone regeneration. Bone grafts
treated with PGM-QK will be implanted into subcutaneous pouches to evaluate vascularization from gradient
release of PGM-QK. In addition, bone grafts coated with both PGM-QK and E7-BMP2pep will be implanted into
cranial defects to determine whether increased vascularization mediated by PGM-QK improves osteogenesis.
Excised tissue will be evaluated for angiogenesis, new bone formation, immune and foreign body response, and
fibrosis. We hypothesize that the osteogenic potency of E7-BMP2pep in conjunction with the increased vessel
network formed in response to PGM-QK peptide will greatly accelerate bone regeneration mediated by bone
grafting materials.","Project Narrative

5F30HL137240-02,GADD45B and Metabolic Memory in Diabetic Heart Failure,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the proposed research project is to determine whether diabetes mellitus epigenetically
programs the heart to fail. Diabetes mellitus confers up to a 4-fold increased risk of developing heart failure
(HF) independently of coronary artery disease or hypertension. Other etiologies of HF are medically managed
with relative efficacy; however, diabetic HF is resistant to these first-line agents. Glycemic control has been
proposed to reduce HF risk; however, this remains controversial, and no effective treatment regimen exists for
diabetic patients once symptoms of HF develop. Thus, a targeted therapy that reverses diabetes-associated
cardiac changes could alter the disease course and improve both quality and duration of life.
In order to understand the underlying pathogenesis of HF in a diabetic heart, we have looked to the field of
epigenetics, which characterizes the integration of environmental stimuli as stable regulatory influences on
gene expression. Specifically, we are interested in determining the extent to which disturbances in the
metabolic milieu are caused by or contribute to epigenetic changes. Previous work has identified a connection
between alterations in DNA methylation - a common epigenetic mark associated with repressed transcription -
and the transcriptional profile in ischemic heart failure. However, the regulatory influences governing cardiac
DNA methylation remain poorly understood, as does the impact of DNA methylation on the heart in the context
of diabetes mellitus. Our preliminary data reveal a functionally-distinct signature of promoter-associated DNA
demethylation in the left ventricle of patients with diabetic HF. Using a combined â€˜-omicsâ€™ approach, I have
subsequently identified Growth Arrest and DNA Damage Inducible 45-beta (GADD45B) as a likely central
regulator that is robustly induced in the failing diabetic human and mouse heart.
Relatively little is known about GADD45B in the heart, as previous work has focused largely on its regulation of
neuronal active DNA demethylation in the context of memory formation. In other tissues, GADD45B has been
shown to orchestrate cellular growth and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress, such as those generated
via fatty acid oxidation. Accordingly, we hypothesize that GADD45B mediates diabetes-associated cardiac
dysfunction via active DNA demethylation of key apoptotic intermediates through a fatty acid-sensitive
mechanism. This proposal will test the following two aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that GADD45B can be
therapeutically targeted to restore cardiac function in the diabetic heart, and (2) Test the hypothesis that the
diabetic milieu potentiates cardiomyocyte GADD45B induction via auto-regulatory DNA demethylation.
Completion of this proposal will also provide a foundation for my career as a physician-scientist with a toolbox
of both innovative techniques and essential skills.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5U54HD061222-15,"Rett syndrome, MECP2 Duplications, and Rett-related Disorders Natural History","Specific Aims: Rett syndrome (RTT, MIM 312750) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
by loss of spoken language and hand use, development of characteristic repetitive hand movements, and 
difficulty walking. Most individuals with RTT have mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MECP2), whose 
protein product MeCP2 functions as an epigenetic gene regulator by recognizing methylated DNA. Recently, a 
â€¢number of promising advances have been reported that modify the disease course, most importantly the 
evidence that restoring gene function in a mouse model rescues phenotypic abnormalities. The emergence of 
potential disease modifying therapies highlights the critical importance of carefully conducted longitudinal 
assessments documenting the natural history of disease, allowing future investigations to ascertain the efficacy 
of evolving therapies. In the previous funding period we established the genotype/phenotype relationship in 
RTT, characterized a number of important clinical features such as quality of life, growth, acquisition of 
developmental skills, epilepsy, and scoliosis,, and described survival and cause of death in RTT. This 
knowledge has been critical in the initiation of clinical treatment trials at three of the four sites. Although we 
have achieved all the aims set out in the previous application, in doing so we uncovered aspects of RTT not 
fully understood. Moreover, the onset of clinical trials has raised additional critical issues that demand 
attention. For example, we now know that the phenotypic spectrum of RTT is broader than initially understood, 
and the currently utilized longitudinal metrics do not completely capture this, variation. Furthermore, the 
currently used clinical rating scales, while good at capturing overall severity, lack the dynamic range needed to 
be useful as outcome measures. Genotype/phenotype analysis demonstrates group properties of common 
mutations; however, additional factors must contribute to the intra-mutation group variation in clinical severity 
observed. Although basic research provides insight into the pathophysiological processes involved in RTT, 
such as the role of alterations in excitatory/inhibitory (E/l) balance, we currently do not know how this relates to 
disease progression or severity in people. Finally, we have no biomarkers to aid in clinical trials. To address 
these issues, we propose to continue the ongoing research with a set of revised Aims and new goals: 
Aim 1: Perform longitudinal and neurobehavioral assessments in people with RTT. Clinical features in 
RTT are dynamic and the phenotypic spectrum is wider than previously believed. Understanding this 
progression and inherent variation is critical for the design and implementation of clinical trials. In order to 
address these issues, we will use knowledge obtained from the current study to develop new, expanded 
longitudinal assessment tools to evaluate a large cohort of people with RTT over time. These data will be used 
to develop new clinical rating scales with qualities suitable for outcome measures in clinical trials. 
Aim 2: Identify additional biological factors that contribute to disease severity in RTT: Specific MECP2 
mutations contribute to disease severity; however, significant variation exists. Factors such as X-chromosome 
inactivation (XCI) skewing and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphisms appear to modulate 
disease severity, but the exact contribution of any factor is currently unknown. Furthermore, unrecognized 
factors likely modify clinical severity. Therefore, we will systematically collect DNA, RNA, and plasma from all 
enrollees, and skin biopsies from select enrollees, for planned and future analysis. All samples will be 
characterized fpr XCI and BDNF polymorphism,analysis, and a model incorporating these data with genotype 
information will be developed to determine the overall contribution of these factors. Additionally, this biological 
material will be banked in a manner linked to the longitudinal clinical information obtained in Aim 1 for future 
analyses, and used for a pilot proposal exploring metabolic profiles in RTT. Ultimately, this work will contribute 
to identification of biomarkers, genetic modifiers, and provide banked material for future studies. 
Aim 3: Identify and characterize neurophysiological and neuroimaging correlates of disease severity in 
RTT. Individuals with RTT show marked abnormalities on a number of neurophysiological measures such as 
EEG and Evoked Potentials (EP), and animal models reproduce many of these abnormalities. Standard 
structural MRI in RTT is generally unremarkable; however, imaging changes are seen with specialized studies. 
Preliminarily, these data suggest an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory function in cortical circuits, 
but the relationship between these neurophysiological and neuroimaging findings to disease severity and 
specific clinical features are unknown. To address this, we will prospectively collect non-invasive measures of 
E/l function on a subset of enrollees. Specifically, we will assess neurophysiological parameters using auditory 
evoked potential (AEP) and clinical EEG. We will also measure in these individuals Glutamate (Glu) and 
GABA concentrations in the auditory cortex of these individuals using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 
(MRS). We will correlate AEP induced gamma frequencies and Glu and GABA concentrations to clinical 
severity, age, and mutation. This will identify relationships between neurophysiological and MRS data and test 
the hypothesis that E/l imbalance is a characteristic feature of RTT that correlates with key clinically-relevant 
parameters.",,2019,400267,394912,5355,Research Centers,U54,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Rett Syndrome,Alan Kenneth Percy

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   
This competitive renewal from a multi-institutional group of investigators with longstanding interest in Rett syndrome (RTT) and RTT-related disorders continues a Rare Disease Clinical Research Center (RDCRC) within the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. This RDCRC will focus on three distinct disorders: RTT, MECP2 duplication disorder, and the RTT-related disorders including CDKL5, FOXG1, and individuals with MECP2 mutations but lacking clinical criteria for RTT. The near-term potential for meaningful therapies is tangible for RTT; the treatment potential for the other disorders is promising. Three overarching specific aims are proposed. 1) Perform longitudinal and neurobehavioral assessments on the core clinical features of each disorder: The on-going RTT NHS has provided critical data for organizing and advancing longitudinal studies. Substantial questions remain for RTT in terms of clinical variability not explainable solely by the specific mutations. Acquisition of similar data for the other disorders is equally important. 2) Perform robust biomarker and clinical outcome measures to identify biological factors that contribute to disease severity in each disorder: Providing critical guidance to effective and discriminant outcome measures is a crucial feature of any clinical trial and requires special consideration for these disorders. 3) Identify and characterize neurophysiological and neuroimaging correlates of disease severity in RTT and RTT-related disorders: Understanding alterations in specific volumetric measures, chemical composition, and neurophysiological measures such as EEG and Evoked Potentials are critical to advancing clinical knowledge. The RDCRC will maintain extensive training and pilot project programs cooperating directly with the respective CTSAs. The RDCRC will work with the Patient Advocacy Groups to ensure a full partnership and will rely principally on the Data Management and Coordinating Center for protocol management, data storage, a website portal, and biostatistical support. The UAB CCTS (CTSA) will fully cooperate with the RDCRC with pilot project development and additional biostatistical support. Website interfaces will be linked with the RDCRC, the DMCC, and the Patients Advocacy groups to ensure the widest reach of relevant information   
   
","Effective therapies for RTT and RTT-related disorders are key to the Rare Diseases mission. This requires 
understanding the natural history through longitudinal assessments, complete documentation of molecular

5K99DE027706-02,Mechanisms regulating afferent innervation in the dental pulp,"Project Summary/Abstract
Since teeth are exposed to environmental stimuli, tooth innervation is crucial to their protection and usage
throughout the life of an organism. The tooth is primarily innervated with sensory nerve fibers from the
trigeminal ganglion (TG) that protect the tooth organ by relaying noxious stimuli. The dental pulp (DP) secretes
neurotrophic factors to guide axonal penetration and sprouting within the tooth during postnatal development in
a highly regulated manner. Research has shown that secreted phosphoprotein, osteopontin (OPN), promotes
neuronal migration, proliferation, and survival [2â€“6]. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the
mesenchymal-neuronal signals that promote and maintain sensory innervation of the teeth. The overall
objective is to determine the role of DP in regulating tooth innervation during development and regeneration.
Our central hypothesis is that Tgfbr2 in the dental mesenchyme governs paracrine signaling via OPN to guide
tooth sensory innervation. Our laboratory has established a mouse model in which Tgfbr2 is conditionally
deleted in odontoblast-producing mesenchyme using an osterix promoter driven Cre recombinase (Tgfbr2cko).
These mice survive postnatally but with significant defects in bones and teeth [7,8]. We performed an mRNA-
Seq analysis using control and mutant postnatal day 7 DP and found that neuronal maintenance and
developmental genes were most highly regulated, including OPN. Immunofluorescent images indicated
reduced innervation throughout the DP in Tgfbr2cko mice. Preliminary experiments with DP and primary TG
nerves demonstrated increased axonal sprouting when TG cells were cultured with DP. Guided by these data,
we will test our hypothesis with the following two specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that Tgfbr2 is necessary
to promote sensory innervation; 2) test the hypothesis that OPN signaling from the DP guides sensory
innervation. In both aims, we propose to cross Tg(Thy1-YFP)16Jrs mice, which express a high level of YFP
throughout the nervous system [9] to optimize visualization of the neurons. Under the first aim, a well-
characterized neurite outgrowth assay will first be used to co-culture TG neurons with DP where Tgfï¢ signals
are manipulated in the DP. In the second part of the first aim, we will use an in vivo dental injury model and
investigate neuronal regeneration in Tgfbr2cko and WT mice. Under the second aim, we will similarly co-culture
TG neurons with OPN-deleted DP cells +/- TGFï¢1 and Tgfbr2-deleted cells supplemented with recombinant
OPN to investigate developmental neurogenesis in the DP. We will perform the dental injury assay on OPN-/-
mice to examine the mechanisms driving neuronal regeneration. The proposed research is significant because
it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how DP cells protect the tooth organ via axonal
guidance mechanisms. Such information will enhance our understanding of the complex interplay of
mesenchymal-neuronal interactions in the tooth that could serve as a basis for future preventative, therapeutic,
and regenerative strategies in endodontics and improve the preservation of teeth.","Project Narrative
Teeth are protected from our daily activities with a high degree of sensory innervation to detect
pressure, temperature and pain, yet dental caries and the associated pain responses are
currently the most chronic disease in the USA [1]. We have established a mouse model in
which Tgfbr2 is deleted in the dental mesenchyme and found neuronal development and
function were highly regulated by the dental pulp. We propose to investigate the mesenchymal-
neuronal crosstalk guided by Tgfï¢ to enhance our current understanding of tooth development
and regeneration and provide new therapeutic targets for pain management and regenerative
strategies.",2019,121041,112075,8966,Other Research-Related,K99,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Pediatric; Regenerative Medicine,Sarah  Peters
5R01DK118236-02,"Effect of Time-Restricted Feeding on 24-hour Glycemic Control, Blood Pressure, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adults with Prediabetes","PROJECT SUMMARY
Increasing evidence suggests that while poor meal timing can cause cardiometabolic disease, optimized meal
timing may reverse it. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a novel type of intermittent fasting that involves eating
within a â‰¤10-hour period, followed by a â‰¥14 hour daily fast. Studies in rodents report that TRF improves glycemic
control, lowers insulin levels, reduces hepatic fat, prevents hyperlipidemia, reduces infarct volume after stroke,
and improves inflammatory markers, relative to eating throughout the day. Importantly, the effects of TRF may
depend on the circadian timing of food intake. Previous TRF trials in humans that limited food intake to the middle
of the daytime (mid-day TRF) reported positive results, while trials that limited food intake to late in the day
reported null or negative results. Building on these studies, we recently conducted the first clinical trial of TRF
where food intake is limited to early during the daytime (early TRF) and found that five weeks of early TRF
improved insulin sensitivity, Î²-cell responsiveness, blood pressure, and oxidative stress in prediabetic menâ€”
even though food intake was matched to the control arm and no weight loss occurred. Here, we propose to
conduct both (1) the first full-scale trial of TRF in humans and (2) the first trial to determine whether the effects
of TRF depend on the circadian timing of food intake. Our proposed study is a three-parallel-arm, controlled
feeding trial designed to determine the efficacy of TRF as a therapy to improve cardiometabolic health in
prediabetic adults. N=144 prediabetic adults (BMIs 25-50 kg/m2; aged 18-75 years old) will be randomized to
one of three isocaloric eating schedules: (1) early TRF: 6-hour feeding interval from 8 am-2 pm; (2) mid-day
TRF: 6-hour feeding interval from 2 pm-8 pm; and (3) control schedule: 12-hour eating interval from 8 am-8 pm.
For 10 weeks, participants will eat calorie-matched meals under remote supervision by video monitoring, and
food intake will be precisely matched on a meal-by-meal basis to the control group to ensure that no weight loss
occurs. The study endpoints will be measured during a 24-hour inpatient test period at both baseline and post-
intervention. The primary endpoint is 24-hour glycemic control as measured by 24-hour mean values of glucose
and insulin; this data will be complemented by mechanistic data on insulin sensitivity and secretion, as measured
by three identical meal tolerance tests on the same day. The secondary endpoints are cardiovascular disease
risk factors, as measured by 24-hour blood pressure and fasting levels of lipids and inflammatory and oxidative
stress markers. We hypothesize that both TRF schedules will improve cardiometabolic health, but the effects of
TRF will depend on the circadian timing of food intake, with the order of improvements being early TRF > mid-
day TRF > control. This study will provide critical insight into (1) whether TRF can be used to treat metabolic
disease; (2) the relative importance of the length of the daily fasting period (intermittent fasting) versus the
circadian timing of food intake (meal timing) for metabolic health; and (3) whether breakfast skipping (tantamount
to mid-day TRF) is beneficial or detrimental for metabolic health when dinner time is unchanged.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01AI134693-02,Strain Dependent Structure and Function of the Influenza NS1 Protein,"Developing effective antiviral drugs requires a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the targeted host-pathogen interaction. Specifically, precise structural models of these interactions can provide mechanistic details with atomic resolution to assist in the efficient development of novel compounds against pathogens of significant health relevance. The influenza virus is a prime example of one such pathogen. Novel strains of the influenza virus develop annually via infection and replication in a number of animal hosts, including humans. The relative ability of these strains to cause disease, or virulence, is determined by a number of interactions between viral and cellular proteins. Although influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known to play a critical role in virulence, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the genetic and structural determinants that facilitate the multiple strain-dependent functions attributed to NS1 in the host cell. It is therefore our long-term goal to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie strain-dependent function of NS1. The objective of this application is to structurally characterize interactions with two cellular proteins (CPSF30 and RIG-I) that are important for the activation of the innate immune response. Our central hypothesis is that structural and dynamic features unique to certain NS1 variants account for the diverse array of functions attributed to NS1. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that elucidating structure- function relationships between NS1 and its cellular interaction partners will aid in the development of antiviral drugs that target these critical interactions known to modulate virulence. Our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I, 2) determine the role of microsecond-millisecond (Âµs-ms) motions in proper function of the NS1 effector domain (NS1ED), and 3) determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. In Aim 1, NMR spectroscopy and mutant recombinant influenza viruses will be used to structurally and functionally characterize the multiple interactions between NS1 and RIG-I. In Aim 2, relaxation dispersion experiments will be used to determine the role that protein dynamics play in facilitating the interaction between the NS1ED and CPSF30 and intracellular localization of NS1. In Aim 3, NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the mechanism of action by which JJ3297 suppresses influenza replication. Our innovative approach will be the first investigation into how protein dynamics and strain specific structural variations facilitate proper function of NS1 in the context of viral replication and pathogenicity. This will also be the first systematic study to determine functional variations in NS1 between multiple strains of influenza. The proposed research is significant because it will define the molecular mechanisms underlying NS1 functions shown to modulate influenza virulence. By defining these molecular mechanisms, this proposal will inform efforts in developing influenza antiviral drugs targeting NS1, thereby supporting the overall mission of the NIH.",The influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a remarkably multi-functional protein capable of modulating virulence through a number of interactions with host cell proteins. The overall goal of this study is to identify the structural and molecular mechanisms that underlie these significant interactions. This proposed research is relevant to public health because its successful completion will increase our understanding of the determinants of influenza virulence and inform ongoing and future studies aimed at developing antivirals that inhibit influenza replication.,2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Pneumonia & Influenza,Chad  Petit
5R01CA197147-04,"Phosphodiesterase 10A, a novel target for lung cancer chemoprevention","Abstract
 Preclinical, clinical and epidemiological studies provide compelling evidence that
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antineoplastic activity and significantly
reduce the incidence and risk of death from multiple cancer types, including lung cancer.
Unfortunately, the long-term use of NSAIDs for chemoprevention and their potential application
for therapy are not recommended because of the risk of potentially fatal side-effects resulting
from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and the suppression of physiologically important
prostaglandins. However, numerous investigators have concluded that the pharmacological
basis for their antineoplastic activity may not require COX inhibition, which suggests the
feasibility of developing safer and more efficacious non-COX inhibitory derivatives for cancer by
targeting the underlying mechanism. We have extensively studied the mechanism by which the
NSAID, sulindac inhibits tumor cell growth and have reported that this activity results from cyclic
guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) inhibition and the activation of
cGMP/protein kinase G signaling to suppress oncogenic Î²-catenin/Tcf-transcriptional activity
and the synthesis of key proteins, such as cyclin D1 and survivin that drive tumor cell
proliferation and survival. Here we show that the cGMP degrading PDE isozyme, PDE10A is a
critically important target of sulindac that is elevated in lung tumors and essential for lung tumor
cell growth. Guided by molecular modeling using the crystal structure of PDE10, we synthesized
a novel series of sulindac derivatives that potently and selectively inhibit lung tumor cell growth
without inhibiting COX-1 or COX-2. These compounds have attractive drug-like properties
whereby high lung concentrations relative to plasma and other tissues can be safely achieved
by oral administration. A lead compound, MCI-048 was identified that displays strong antitumor
activity in an orthotopic mouse model of lung cancer. Further analog development to identify a
preclinical drug development candidate and studies to better define the role of PDE10 in lung
cancer are therefore urgently needed. The following aims are proposed: 1) synthesize a novel
series of sulindac derivatives to improve potency and selectivity, 2) evaluate PDE10 and lung
tumor cell growth inhibitory activity of sulindac derivatives, 3) evaluate antitumor activity of
sulindac derivatives in mouse models of lung cancer, and 4) further define the role of PDE10 in
lung cancer. The focus of this project on the development of novel anticancer drugs and target
validation for chemoprevention or therapy have the potential to impact individuals at risk of
developing lung cancer as well as patients with advanced stage malignant disease.","Project Narrative
The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac has shown promising antineoplastic activity,
but its long-term use for chemoprevention or therapy is not recommended because of potentially
fatal gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities associated with cyclooxygenase (COX)
inhibition and the suppression of physiologically important prostaglandins. Here we propose to
synthesize and evaluate a novel series of sulindac derivatives lacking COX-associated toxicities
that have potent antitumor activity by targeting phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10), an enzyme
overexpressed in lung tumors and essential for tumor cell growth. These studies, as well as
efforts to further define the role of PDE10 in lung cancer, are highly significant to human health
because new molecular targets and small molecule inhibitors with drug-like properties are
urgently needed to develop safe and effective new drugs for the prevention or treatment of lung
cancer.",2019,336158,221887,114271,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,366880002,Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Lung; Lung Cancer; Prevention,Gary A Piazza
3R01CA197147-04S1,Enhancing the Immune System by Targeting the RAS Signaling Pathway in Cancer: Immunotherapeutic Potential of a Novel RAS Inhibitor for lung cancer treatment.,"ABSTRACT
 The Diversity Research Supplement Program to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research from
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) provides a great
career development opportunity to Dr. Antonio Bartholomew Ward, an African-American cancer researcher
holding a full-time faculty position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of South Alabama
Mitchell Cancer Institute (USA-MCI) to continue his academic career and develop his pathway as an
independent investigator. He is applying for this supplement based on the parent grant entitled
â€œPhosphodiesterase 10A, a Novel Target for Lung Cancer Chemoprevention (1R01CA197147)â€, awarded to
Dr. Gary Piazza, Professor of Oncologic Sciences and Chief of the Drug Discovery Research Center at MCI.
 The parent grant proposes studies to chemically modify sulindac to block cyclooxygenase (COX)
binding to eliminate related gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side-effects, while increasing potency
and selectivity to inhibit lung tumor cell growth by inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate
phosphodiesterases (cGMP PDEs) enzymes. Specifically, the PDE 10 isozyme was found to be elevated in
lung tumor cells and essential for lung tumor cell growth and survival. His team has also explored the
molecular mechanism driving the apoptosis of lung tumor cells induced by sulindac derivatives that involves
the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G signaling and suppression of oncogenic Î²-catenin/Tcf-
mediated transcriptional activity to inhibit cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and survivin.
 For this supplement application Dr. Ward proposes a recently discovered mechanism responsible for
the anti-cancer activity of sulindac derivatives, specifically with compound MCI-062, based on his preliminary
data showing compound selectivity for inhibiting the growth of colon and lung cancer cells harboring the
oncogenic mutant form of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS), specifically KRAS, and on recent literature
linking mutant KRAS to an increased expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor protein programmed death
ligand-1 (PD-L1) on the surface of cancer cells thereby promoting increased cancer cell immunity. He
hypothesizes that by inhibiting RAS-RAS effector binding and RAS cell signaling, PD-L1 protein levels will also
be decreased, thereby increasing anti-cancer immunity. Dr. Ward will investigate if MCI-062 effects are
mediated by RAS inhibition and a decrease in PD-L1 protein levels, leading to an increase in T-lymphocyte (T-
cell) tumor infiltration, proliferation, and activation, and determine the mechanism of action responsible for anti-
cancer immunity effects using 2D and 3D RAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models.
 In conclusion, this research will validate a novel RAS inhibitor, MCI-062, for targeted therapeutic use in
NSCLC by its effect on RAS regulated cancer cell immunity and increase the need for small molecule targeted
immunotherapeutic approaches for difficult to treat RAS-driven cancers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 This research proposal for a supplement application to the parent grant, 1R01CA197147 (P.I. Gary

sulindac to exert their anti-tumor and anti-cancer cell immunity activity by inhibiting RAS and decreasing PD-L1
protein levels thereby increasing T-cell proliferation, activation, and infiltration to tumor sites in lung tumor cells
harboring oncogenic mutations in the KRAS gene. NSCLCs that harbor RAS mutations are associated with
poor prognosis and survival in humans, therefore applying small molecule targeted therapy against cancer
oncogenes such as RAS in order to weaken cancer cell immunity and enhance the bodyâ€™s own natural immune
response to combat cancer is indeed a novel approach worth investigating. This supplement will expand Dr.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NSAIDs significantly reduce the incidence and risk of death from colorectal cancer, but their long-term use for chemoprevention is not recommended because of potentially fatal side-effects resulting from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and the suppression of physiological prostaglandins. Some investigators have concluded that the mechanism for the anticancer activity of NSAIDs may not require COX inhibition, but involves selective apoptosis induction of neoplastic cells and suggest that safer and more efficacious non-COX inhibitory derivatives can be developed by targeting the underlying pathway leading to apoptosis. We have extensively studied the mechanism by which the NSAID sulindac induces apoptosis and reported that this activity is closely associated with its ability to inhibit cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE), which activates cGMP/protein kinase G signaling to suppress oncogenic Â¿-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcriptional activity and the synthesis of key cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1 and survivin. We recently discovered that PDE10 is a critically important target of sulindac, which is elevated in colon tumors and essential for tumor cell growth. Using the indene scaffold of sulindac, we synthesized a series of non-COX inhibitory derivatives that selectively inhibit PDE10 and tumor cell growth. A prototype inhibitor, MCI-020 was identified with strong antitumor activity and the potential to inhibit metastasis. Further chemical optimization of MCI-020 and studies to better define the role of PDE10 in colorectal tumorigenesis are, however, necessary to develop this approach for chemoprevention. The following aims are proposed: 1) design and synthesize novel sulindac derivatives with selectivity to inhibit PDE10, 2) evaluate PDE10 selectivity and in vitro anticancer activity of sulindac derivatives, 3) determine in vivo anticancer activity of promising sulindac derivatives in mouse models of colon tumor growth and metastasis, and 4) measure PDE10 expression during colon tumorigenesis in whole animals and human clinical samples. The goal is to identify a lead compound with safety and efficacy attributes that will merit consideration for clinical trials. Elucidation of the role of PDE10 in colorectal tumorigeness may also provide insight to biomarkers and imaging methods for the early detection of cancer using radiopharmaceuticals.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac strongly inhibits adenoma formation in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, but its long-term use for preventing colorectal cancer is limited by potentially fatal side-effects resulting from cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and the suppression of physiologically important prostaglandins. We propose studies to chemically modify sulindac to block COX binding, while increasing potency and selectivity to inhibit PDE10, a novel cancer target we recently discovered to be overexpressed in colon tumor cells and essential for their growth. These studies are highly significant to human health because of their potential to identify a new drug candidate for the treatment of individuals at high risk of developing colorectal cancer as well as a biomarker for the early detection of colorectal cancer.",2019,365641,260736,104905,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,366880002,Cancer; Clinical Research; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Prevention,Gary A Piazza
7R56AG061051-03,"Dissecting the Interplay between proteasome dysfunction, proteostasis and Alzheimer's disease","Project Summary/Abstract
 Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) affects 5.5 million Americans producing cognitive deficits and mortality. There
is no treatment for AD, thus, development of interventions to slow or reverse AD symptoms is a critical area of
research. Furthermore, AD is difficult to detect until substantial neurodegeneration has already occurred. This
proposal investigates proteasome function both as an intervention to AD symptoms and as a tool for early
stage diagnosis in peripheral tissues. A key symptom of AD is proteostatic dysfunction. Patients as well as
animal models of AD have a pronounced decline in proteasome function. Using in vivo invertebrate and in vitro
vertebrate models of AD, we have found that genetic and pharmacologic augmentation of proteasome delays
cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms, while reducing proteasome function accelerates AD progression.
 This proposal builds on the above exciting findings and is designed in response to RFA-AG-18-020,
Role of Peripheral Proteostasis on Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease. The proposal has three goals.
The first goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how proteasome dysfunction is linked to
AD progression. We present, and test, two hypotheses to explain this interplay. The first hypothesis is that the
proteasome has a key role in prevention of AD progression through degradation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) machinery
and or its substrate (APP, BACE1, and Î³-secretase activators, are all targets of proteasome degradation). If
our results bear out, it would indicate that age-related declines in proteasome function result in a build-up of
these proteins, which accelerates AD progression. The second hypothesis we test is if proteasome dysfunction
triggered by AÎ² inhibition drives downstream neurodegeneration rather than altering AÎ² accumulation.
Proteasome dysfunction on its own is shown to cause neurodegeneration and synaptic loss. If our findings are
consistent with this, it would indicate that proteasome dysfunction caused by AÎ² inhibition is an intermediator
for AD-induced cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration. The second goal is to test if AD triggers
proteasome dysfunction in peripheral tissues as a diagnostic tool for early AD screening. We have
initial findings supporting this. The third goal is to test if genetic or pharmacologic proteasome
augmentation is a germane target for treatment of AD-like symptoms in mice that model AD. These
experiments are designed to advance us toward the long-term goal of developing novel screening tools and
treatments for AD in humans. This multi-PI project, led by a new investigator, seeks to develop a mechanistic
understanding of the interplay between the proteasome and AD, test the efficacy of genetic and pharmacologic
proteasome manipulation as an AD intervention, and test the viability of peripheral proteasome dysfunction as
an early diagnosis tool. Our innovative models, state-of-the-art methods, expert investigative team, compelling
preliminary data, novel pharmacologics, new transgenic lines, and diverse biological systems increase the
likelihood of successfully achieving our goals and provide potential for clinical relevance.","Project Narrative
Increasing the function of the proteasome (protein complexes that degrade unneeded or damaged proteins)

and pharmacologic manipulation of this system can rescue cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s
disease, and better understand how proteasome manipulation alters Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression. This
work is done with the goal of leading to development of new drugs, interventions and screening tools to relieve

7R01MH121928-02,Biological and environmental factors driving behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's disease,"Project Summary
This project will investigate how different environmental, personal and disease related factors contribute to the
experience of behavioral symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD will experience
behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD) at some point during their illness, though most patients will not
experience all types of BSD or experience them in a predictable pattern. This has made development of effective
treatments and symptom management approaches for AD highly challenging. Our pilot data shows a high degree
of intraindividual heterogeneity in daily reports of BSD both in type of symptom and frequency of occurrence.
Others report significant intraindividual heterogeneity in the rate of change in BSD over a 3-month period. It is
currently unclear what mechanisms contribute to these within- and between-person variations in BSD. While
BSD subsyndromes have been proposed it is unclear how the types of BSD within the subsyndromes are
temporally dependent or distinct from each other. As applied to AD, the Revised Symptom Management Model,
points to environmental (i.e., unmet needs, stressors), personal (i.e., genetic, microbiome, ethnicity), and disease
(i.e., HSV1 infection, systemic inflammation) factors as mechanistic pathways for BSD. We hypothesize that
these factors across multiple systems contribute to the mechanistic development of BSD, and thus the variability
in individual BSD expression. Elucidation of these factors across multiple systems will help create personalized
approaches to treatment of BSD spanning from caregiving behavioral training to pharmacological interventions.
Dyads of co-residing caregivers and persons with AD or mixed-type AD (with vascular involvement) (N=162
dyads) will be recruited. Equal numbers of Caucasian and African American dyads will be enrolled so that the
contributing role of racial differences can be examined. Using a micro-longitudinal design, caregivers will
complete daily diaries for 30 days reporting on their observations of environmental exposures, including type,
frequency, duration, and severity of BSD. At enrollment and at the start of each new week of diaries, dyads will
visit the research clinic where blood and stool samples will be collected from the person with AD (for 5 samples
total). BSD will be reported in the daily diary entries, with BSD type measured as presence or absence of 22
symptoms across 17 domains. We will use a multi-level model analytic framework to examine hypotheses
outlines in the research strategy in order to complete the following aims: (1) Determine how environmental (i.e.,
unmet needs, stressors), personal (i.e., genetic, microbiome, ethnicity) and disease (i.e. HSV1 infection,
systemic inflammation) factors impact probability of daily BSD, either directly or through interaction effects, and
(2) Identify subsyndromes of BSD, and predictors of group membership. Impact: By competitively testing leading
hypotheses for BSD, this project will elucidate criteria for distinguishing patients with BSD that are not resolvable
via appropriate attention to their unmet needs. Findings from this project will inform targeted interventions to
support persons with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers.

pig lungs and livers are â€œperfusedâ€ with human blood, and in life-supporting in vivo baboon transplant models. 
 In this Project, we will evaluate whether two novel gene modifications to the pig will address the 
remaining problems. One modification is expected to inhibit coagulation pathway amplification by â€œtissue 
factorâ€ (Aim 1a), and the other targets platelet adhesion via the platelet's â€œGP1bâ€ receptor (Aim 2). We predict 
that these genetic changes to the Platform pig will be partly successful, but may not completely solve the 
problems of platelet and neutrophil adhesion and inflammation. 
 Planning for this outcome, we have strong evidence that specific â€œadhesion moleculesâ€ are responsible 
for some or all of the platelet and neutrophil adhesion phenomena that we see with our current Platform pig 
genetics. We will therefore also test several carefully chosen, clinically applicable drugs, and measure their 
effects on the residual pig organ injury response (Aims 1b, and 1c). These clinically applicable pharmacologic 
interventions will both help us understand the remaining problems better (define the contribution of specific 
pathways to liver and lung xenograft injury), and allow us to study mechanisms of organ injury that may 
currently be masked by the pathways under study in this Project and in Project 1. The revised Platform 
regimen will be evaluated in Aim 3, where the life-supporting capacity of pig lung and liver grafts will be 
rigorously assessed, using an immunosuppressive strategy identified from Project 1. If justified by interval 
findings, alternative approaches described in Project 2 or anti-inflammatory strategies (primarily under study in 
Aim 1) are available, one or more of which may prove necessary to reproducibly protect pig livers and lungs 
from injury in a human blood environment or in baboons. 
 Project 2 is thus likely to solve several of the most important known barriers to clinical use of pig lungs 
and livers. Together with complementary contributions from Project 1, knowledge gained from this Program is 
also likely to contribute significantly toward therapeutic clinical application of lung and other organ xenografts: 
to facilitate progress into clinical trials by providing an evidence base for rationally selecting the specific 
strategies to be included in treatment of the first recipients of pig organ xenografts.",,2019,729125,729125,0,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Liver Disease; Lung; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation,Richard N Pierson

The Administrative Core of the UAB Vision Science Research Center P30 grant performs an essential function
in overseeing the overall activity of the scientific Cores, and making sure that funds are appropriately utilized to
support the highest quality science in a diverse range of vision disciplines. Another major role of this Core in
conjunction with the efforts of the Vision Science Research Center is to promote and actively foster new
collaboration, and to provide support and guidance to new and less established investigators to develop and
strengthen their research programs. Both the Core Director/PI, Dr. Pittler and Co-Director/Co-PI, Dr. Gamlin
are NEI R01 supported and maintain active and productive labs. Their combined expertise in diverse areas of
vision research, and now 16 year established strong working relationship, makes them an excellent team to

UAB internal and external NEI R01 grant holders and additional input from UAB P30 participants and others in
a monthly open forum of all UAB vision scientists that precedes Vision Research at UAB seminars.
Additionally, the quality of Core provided resources and services is measured by annual surveys and through
interaction with faculty at faculty meetings and retreats. Support to continue two staff personnel with several
years of administrative experience is requested to facilitate day-to-day operations such as ordering supplies,
maintaining compliance and budgets, coordinating repairs if needed and assisting with document preparation

5R01EY029341-02,Development and characterization of mouse models of RP59 DHDDS deficiency,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Within the family of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs), defects in the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate
synthase (DHDDS) gene cause a recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP59; OMIM #613861). Patients with
a K42E mutation in DHDDS exhibit progressive loss of both rod and cone function, as well as macular changes,
suggestive of RPE involvement. The DHDDS enzyme is ubiquitously required in all cells for protein N-
glycosylation. We wish to understand the basis for selective ocular pathology associated with ubiquitous DHDDS
mutation and the contribution of specific ocular cell types to the pathology of mutant Dhdds-mediated retinal
degeneration. As a first step, we devised a selective knockout scheme to study the importance of the enzyme in
specific retinal cell types. To circumvent known embryonic lethality associated with DHDDS knockout, we
generated a Cre-dependent knockout allele of murine Dhdds (Dhddsflx/flx). Additionally, we used CRISPR/Cas
technology to generate a knock-in K42E mouse model of RP59. We propose to use these novel mouse lines to
examine the mechanism of disease induced by DHDDS enzyme deficiency and to identify the primary site(s) of
ocular pathology. In Aim 1, using rod-specific Cre expression, we will address the prevailing hypothesis that
defective rhodopsin glycosylation is the major cause of Dhdds mutation-mediated pathology. In Aim 2, using
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific Cre expression, we will examine the effects of perturbation of DHDDS
activity on RPE structure and function. In Aim 3, we will selectively perturb DHDDS activity in MÃ¼ller glia, and
examine their contribution to Dhdds-dependent retinal degeneration. In Aim 4, we will characterize a newly
generated K42E knock-in RP mouse model and compare the resulting structural and functional changes with
those observed in the three knockout models to assess the pathological importance of each cell type. These four
Aims will utilize a combination of state-of-the-art methodologies, including Cre-lox technology, CRISPR-Cas9-
mediated genome editing, electroretinography (ERG), ultrahigh resolution spectral domain-optical coherence
tomography (UHR SD-OCT), optokinetic reflex (OKR), light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and
lectin histochemistry, Western blot analysis, HPLC, and MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). Each stand-
alone aim will provide significant new insights into the importance of DHDDS activity in the neural retina and
RPE, and collectively will provide information that can guide rational treatment design for specific intervention in
DHDDS-mediated RP. The overarching hypothesis is that, contrary to conclusions from initial reports, RP59 is
not a simple disorder of altered rhodopsin glycosylation; rather, it is a complex disorder involving primary
pathology in more than one cell type that may require a more global approach for effective therapeutic
intervention. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we will be well positioned to pursue future proof-of-
principle preclinical gene therapy studies to correct the genetic defect that otherwise would result in blindness.","8. Project Narrative

MCL1 expression to maintain homeostasis. Aberrant MCL1 expression facilitates tumor progression and

5P01HL136267-03,Circadian control of sodium excretion,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
 High salt diets have grown increasingly prevalent in the Western world and contribute to increased risk of
cardiovascular disease including hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The renal endothelin system has
emerged an important control system for sodium and water excretion and so derangements in this pathway
could provide insights for potential new therapeutic approaches. Abnormalities in circadian rhythms are
associated with increased risk of a wide range of metabolic, cardiovascular, and other disorders. Furthermore,
cardiovascular events are far more prevalent at specific times of day suggesting a circadian contribution of
cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have revealed that the peripheral molecular clock regulates water and
sodium homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We recently observed that Bmal1, a
circadian-dependent transcription factor, loses its rhythmicity under high salt diet conditions and appears to be
regulated by the endothelin (ET) system. Rats lacking a functional ETB receptor have a severely delayed
response to an acute salt load that is dependent upon the time of day. Therefore, our goal is to determine the
relationship between the ET-1 system and circadian regulation of sodium excretion. Aim 1 is designed to test
the hypothesis that ETB receptor activation suppresses Bmal1 to facilitate sodium excretion and account for
diurnal renal sodium handling. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Bmal1 functions to suppress sodium
excretion. We have also uncovered that female rats are protected against the loss of excretory control in a
diurnal manner that may be due to differences in sex steroid function. Thus, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
the balance between effects of testosterone and estrogen effects on vascular ETA receptor function accounts
for sex differences in diurnal control of sodium excretion.","PROJECT 1 NARRATIVE
 Hypertension remains the major risk factor for a huge number of cardiovascular diseases including chronic
kidney disease and stroke. Much of this problem is due to the so-called â€œWesternâ€ diet rich in salt, which
expands the scope of the problem. Disruption of daily rhythms increase the risk of cardiovascular and
metabolic disease, for example, many cardiovascular events occur more frequently at specific times of day.
Furthermore, many cardiovascular risk factors are different between men and women. Studies in the current
proposal will elucidate the mechanisms responsible for defects in salt handling in clinically relevant animal
models and allow us to learn more about time of day and sex differences that could lead to the development of
novel treatment regimens.",2019,482658,353546,129112,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cardiovascular; Genetics; Hypertension; Kidney Disease; Nutrition,DAVID M POLLOCK
3P01HL136267-03S1,Integrating novel mechanisms controlling sodium excretion and blood pressure,"OVERALL â€“ PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to generate new information about how fluid-
electrolyte balance is regulated and thus contributes to blood pressure control. Our studies largely focus on
mechanisms related to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its associated receptors, ETA and ETB. Previous studies from
investigators on the project team revealed a significant role for this system in controlling renal handling of salt
and water balance, control of renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure regulation. Investigators have
demonstrated that defects in this system results in hypertension that is highly sensitive to dietary salt intake.
This is a complicated yet powerful system that balances the vasodilatory and pro-natriuretic actions of the ETB
receptor with the vasoconstrictor pro-inflammatory effects of ETA receptor activation. Exploring both renal
tubular actions, primarily in the collecting duct, along with hemodynamic effects represents a diverse approach
that is unique to this PPG. Our proposed program has several major themes that seek to elucidate novel
mechanisms of renal control of sodium handling. In Project 1, we have evidence that ET-1 contributes to
circadian regulation of blood pressure, and so we will explore how ET-1 impacts sodium excretion at different
times of day. Project 2 will closely examine how alterations in renal tubular fluid flow that are associated with
varying body fluid volume status modulate production of ET-1 within the collecting duct system and how it is
regulated by the primary cilia, polycystins and other mediators. Recent findings from Project 3 have
demonstrated a unique regulatory system involving acetylation and deacetylation of NOS1 in the collecting
duct that impacts sodium handling and salt-dependent changes in blood pressure. Furthermore, both NOS1
and NOS3 are expressed in principal cells of the collecting duct, and so we have proposed a novel hypothesis
whereby these two enzymes are regulating different aspects of cellular function. In addition, Projects 2 and 3
investigate how NOS1 and NOS3 in the collecting duct modulate both ET-1 production and actions. Finally,
two cores support this PPG: the administrative core and the animal and analytical core. The administrative
core manages and coordinates overall PPG activities, provides financial accounting and budgetary support,
schedules and arranges meetings of PPG investigators, and manages statistical analysis and data
management activities. Core B, the animal and analytical core, is responsible for managing breeding and
genotyping for rodents in all three projects. In conclusion, these studies are expected to uncover important
regulatory pathways that will aid our understanding of fluid-electrolyte and blood pressure control in health and
in disease.","OVERALL â€“ PROJECT NARRATIVE
This PPG focuses on elucidating mechanisms by which the kidney controls sodium excretion, and therefore,

side effects of the relevant class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists. We expect these studies

1R01HL144716-01A1,Timing of sodium intake and nocturnal sodium excretion and blood pressure in obese African Americans,"SUMMARY
 Timing of food intake affects a variety of pathophysiological systems. The Western diet, which is high in
salt, also contributes to excess morbidity and mortality related to obesity and hypertension. Nocturnal
hypertension frequently occurs in obesity and is recognized as an important consequence of hypertension risk,
yet the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are poorly understood. Experimental data from our group
have shown that timing of sodium intake impacts diurnal patterns of sodium excretion. Further, we recently
reported that high salt intake causes a shift in expression of circadian control genes in the kidney. Additional
studies demonstrate that obese animals have an impaired response to a natriuretic stimulus.
 Given the established contribution of high salt intake to obesity-dependent hypertension, particularly,
nocturnal hypertension, we hypothesize that the time of day for salt intake impacts (1) blood pressure rhythms
and urinary sodium excretion and (2) circadian timing of factors responsible for blood pressure regulation and
cardiometabolic health in obese individuals. Because of the very high prevalence of nocturnal hypertension
and salt-sensitivity in black adults, we will conduct a randomized, cross-over feeding study of 55 obese black
adults with non-dipping sleep blood pressure.
 These studies will address two aims. The first aim will test the hypothesis that limiting high salt intake prior
to sleep increases day-night differences in blood pressure, improves timing of urinary sodium excretion, and
improves metabolic risk factors. We will monitor 24-hour blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring to determine the role of timing of sodium intake on diurnal blood pressure patterns. Day- and night-
time sodium excretion will be used to determine whether improvements in blood pressure are mediated by
enhanced sodium excretion during the day. We will also assess the effects of timing of sodium intake on lipids,
leptin, adiponectin, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory cytokines, and immune cell activation over 24 hours.
 The second aim will test the hypothesis that limiting high salt intake prior to sleep preferentially improves
rhythmicity in peripheral vs. central circadian clock factors linked to renal sodium handling. Circadian measures
of plasma cortisol, dim light melatonin onset, and core body temperature (telemetry) will be used to assess the
phase and amplitude of the core circadian clock. Circadian measures of peripheral clock genes in buccal cells
and peripheral blood monocytes will be used to determine the phase and amplitude of the peripheral clock.
 The proposed hypothesis-driven studies will determine how timing of sodium intake affects diurnal blood
pressure and circadian timing of factors responsible for blood pressure control and metabolic health, with the
ultimate goal of identifying novel strategies to treat nocturnal hypertension and metabolic disease in obesity.","NARRATIVE
Timing of food intake affects a variety of pathophysiological systems including greater risk for obesity and
hypertension. However, nothing is known about the risk of high salt intake at different times of day. Preclinical
studies indicate that the time of day impacts the speed at which the kidney eliminates a salt load and so the

5P01HL136267-03,Integrating novel mechanisms controlling sodium excretion and blood pressure,"OVERALL â€“ PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to generate new information about how fluid-
electrolyte balance is regulated and thus contributes to blood pressure control. Our studies largely focus on
mechanisms related to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its associated receptors, ETA and ETB. Previous studies from
investigators on the project team revealed a significant role for this system in controlling renal handling of salt
and water balance, control of renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure regulation. Investigators have
demonstrated that defects in this system results in hypertension that is highly sensitive to dietary salt intake.
This is a complicated yet powerful system that balances the vasodilatory and pro-natriuretic actions of the ETB
receptor with the vasoconstrictor pro-inflammatory effects of ETA receptor activation. Exploring both renal
tubular actions, primarily in the collecting duct, along with hemodynamic effects represents a diverse approach
that is unique to this PPG. Our proposed program has several major themes that seek to elucidate novel
mechanisms of renal control of sodium handling. In Project 1, we have evidence that ET-1 contributes to
circadian regulation of blood pressure, and so we will explore how ET-1 impacts sodium excretion at different
times of day. Project 2 will closely examine how alterations in renal tubular fluid flow that are associated with
varying body fluid volume status modulate production of ET-1 within the collecting duct system and how it is
regulated by the primary cilia, polycystins and other mediators. Recent findings from Project 3 have
demonstrated a unique regulatory system involving acetylation and deacetylation of NOS1 in the collecting
duct that impacts sodium handling and salt-dependent changes in blood pressure. Furthermore, both NOS1
and NOS3 are expressed in principal cells of the collecting duct, and so we have proposed a novel hypothesis
whereby these two enzymes are regulating different aspects of cellular function. In addition, Projects 2 and 3
investigate how NOS1 and NOS3 in the collecting duct modulate both ET-1 production and actions. Finally,
two cores support this PPG: the administrative core and the animal and analytical core. The administrative
core manages and coordinates overall PPG activities, provides financial accounting and budgetary support,
schedules and arranges meetings of PPG investigators, and manages statistical analysis and data
management activities. Core B, the animal and analytical core, is responsible for managing breeding and
genotyping for rodents in all three projects. In conclusion, these studies are expected to uncover important
regulatory pathways that will aid our understanding of fluid-electrolyte and blood pressure control in health and
in disease.","OVERALL â€“ PROJECT NARRATIVE
This PPG focuses on elucidating mechanisms by which the kidney controls sodium excretion, and therefore,
has direct relevance to the serious health problem of salt-dependent hypertension and kidney disease. The
three main projects each utilize relevant animal models and sophisticated in vitro techniques to uncover the
pathways that lead to salt-dependent high blood pressure as well as uncovering ways to combat significant
side effects of the relevant class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists. We expect these studies
will be important in guiding future clinical and therapeutic practices for a broad range of cardiovascular and
related diseases.",2019,2259697,1756435,503262,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,DAVID M POLLOCK

5P01HL136267-03,HDAC-mediated regulation of endothelin and nitric oxide,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
 Sodium homeostasis is critical for maintenance of normal blood pressure. The collecting duct (CD) is
integral to the physiological regulation of natriuresis through control of CD Na+ transport processes. Our PPG
group has delineated that the ET-1/ETB pathway in the CD is a major component of controlling blood pressure
and Na+ homeostasis. Activation of the NOS/NO pathway in the CD is necessary for ET-1/ETB mediated
inhibition of Na+ reabsorption by the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and subsequent Na+ excretion. The
mechanism of NOS activation, specifically the distinct activation of NOS1 and NOS3 isoforms, and the
relationship with the ET-1/ETB pathway in the CD are obscure. We discovered a novel high salt-induced
regulatory pathway mediated by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC enzymes catalyze lysine deacetylation
of histones in the nucleus epigenetically regulating gene transcription. We found that high salt significantly
increases renal HDAC1 expression. Renal medullary infusion of an HDAC1 inhibitor in high salt fed rats
significantly increased blood pressure and blunted urinary ET-1 excretion. In preliminary studies, we found that
over-expression of HDAC1 in IMCD cells up-regulates ET-1 mRNA expression. Interestingly, HDAC1 is a
member of the molecular feedback loop of circadian transcriptional control genes, thus in coordination with
project 1 we will determine whether HDAC1 regulates ET-1 expression in a circadian manner. HDAC enzymes
also regulate lysine deacetylation of non-histone, cellular proteins in the cytosolic compartment. HDAC1
inhibition in rats on high salt diet also significantly reduced urinary NOx excretion. The CD, especially IMCD, is
exposed to 10-fold increases in flow with high salt intake compared to low salt intake. We find that flow-induced
NO production is Ca2+- and HDAC1-dependent in IMCD cells. Flow induces NOS1- and NOS3-derived NO
production in IMCD cells. We find that CD NOS1 is localized in the cytosolic compartment and directly interacts
with HDAC1. HDAC inhibition increases lysine acetylation of NOS1 without altering NOS1 expression in IMCD
cells. NOS3 is absent in the cytosolic compartment of IMCD, thus we propose that HDAC1 regulation of NOS3
activity is mediated indirectly. High salt induces Thr495NOS3 dephosphorylation mediating increased NOS3
activity. Our preliminary studies show that renal medullary HDAC1 inhibition prevents Thr495NOS3
dephosphorylation in high salt fed rats. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is implicated in the dephosphorylation of
Thr495NOS3, thus we will determine whether HDAC1 activates PP1. The overall hypothesis is that high salt
increases Na+ excretion via activation of CD HDAC1 dependent up-regulation of CD ET-1/ETB signaling along
with NOS1 and NOS3 activity.","PROJECT 3 NARRATIVE
High sodium consumption contributes to vast numbers of cardiovascular-related deaths. Dysfunctional
sodium excretion results in salt-sensitive hypertension. Our innovative data shows that high salt diet induces
the enzyme, histone deacetylase, in the renal collecting duct to maintain normal sodium excretion and blood
pressure control. We also found that histone deacetylase regulates the pro-natriuretic activation of endothelin-
1 expression as well as the activation of nitric oxide synthase in the collecting duct. The main goals of this
proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms critical for salt-dependent activation of histone deacetylase and the
pro-natriuretic factors to provide in-depth understanding of the physiological contribution of these mechanisms
on sodium excretion and maintenance of blood pressure control.",2019,540763,409599,131164,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Kidney Disease,Jennifer S Pollock
1R25DK112731-01A1,PRedOctoral phd and md research training in TEams (PROmoTE),"Project Summary/Abstract
Kidney diseases are ever increasing, however there are fewer approved therapies, fewer clinical trials, and
fewer research articles published than other internal medicine specialties over the past 10+ years. It has been
postulated that the next generation of potential investigators and nephrologists are discouraged from pursuing
careers in nephrology from a perception that kidney research is â€œtoo complexâ€. However, other causes may be
a limited exposure to clinical nephrology in medical school and a lack of mentors to positively influence kidney
research as a career choice. To overcome these obstacles, the kidney community must be willing to utilize
novel approaches to building skills and training for a diverse pool of students. Training of PhD and MD
students is non-overlapping with little direct interactions of the students limiting future communication skills and
creativity. Thus, a new paradigm for translational renal research training of PhD and MD students is required.
The overall goal of this proposal is to initiate a pilot program in kidney disease research for a novel
scheme of skills development and team training of PhD and MD students at UAB. This novel concept will
incorporate team training of PhD and MD students to foster development of critical thinking, communication,
team dynamics, and hands on research skills. This will be accomplished by the MD student-PhD student
teams participating together in novel coursework and a shared research project. In addition, the PRedOctoral
phd and md research training in TEams (PROmoTE) program will provide an opportunity for UAB students to
engage directly and deeply in original research focused on kidney disease. This program will expose our

5R01CA184770-05,Targeted therapy for breast cancer with osteolytic bone damage,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone is the most common site of metastasis for breast cancer (BCa), which causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced disease. A vicious cycle involving BCa cells and cells in the bone microenvironment results in the activation of osteoclasts and increased bone destruction. Combination chemotherapy and bisphosphonate use for bone lesions provide very little effect on morbidity and survival. Thus, development of newer therapies that can both ameliorate bone destruction and improve survival of patients with metastatic breast disease is needed. A better understanding of the molecular events in BCa bone pathology indicates that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) stimulates the recruitment, differentiation, and activation of osteoclasts by binding to RANK. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a ""decoy"" receptor that competes with RANK for RANKL, thereby modulating the effects of RANKL. However, during metastases, endogenous OPG levels are markedly reduced. Thus, OPG remains as an effective molecule for future therapies for bone metastasis. The growth of disseminated tumor in the bone further alters the immune milieu through infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that dampen the host anti-tumor immune responses. Further, we identified that MDSCs function as osteoclast progenitors directly during this vicious metastatic cascade within the bone both in mouse and in humans, enhancing bone destruction. The current proposal will address three major aspects, namely: osteolytic bone damage, tumor growth and immunosuppression using a genetically-modified stem cell approach targeting osteoclast activation, induction of tumor cell apoptosis using TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and using gemcitabine for MDSC ablation, respectively, in combination. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is bone-targeted delivery of genetically-engineered OPG, while retaining RANKL binding but abolishing TRAIL binding, in combination with TRAIL therapy together with targeting the MDSC population will significantly decrease osteolytic bone damage, remodel the damaged skeleton, and induce tumor cell apoptosis to improve survival. This hypothesis will be tested using an immunocompetent, preclinical mouse model of bone-disseminated BCa for possible clinical translation.  Towards achieving this goal, we have recently established: a) the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) targeting RANK signaling by using OPG, b) a unique in vivo targeting strategy to enhance bone-specific homing of genetically-engineered MSC, c) the role of MDSCs in forming osteoclasts directly, and d) that depletion of MDSCs enhances anti-tumor Th1 activity in a bone metastatic BCa model. Further, since OPG also binds to TRAIL thereby increasing tumor cells survival, we have: e) identified putative TRAIL binding domain(s) on OPG by homology modeling, and f) developed a mutant OPG (OPGm) that retains RANKL binding but abolishes TRAIL binding and confirmed its biological activity both in vitro and in vivo in bone
remodeling. These advances are anticipated to result in a novel treatment option for bone-disseminated BCa.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Patients with bone-disseminated breast cancer (BCa) have poor survival with less than 2 years necessitating development of novel therapies to reduce morbidity and increase survival.

5R01HD069560-10,Novel Genetic Models of Autism,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common, debilitating disorders affecting social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Recent genetic findings have identified mutations in synaptic cell adhesion genes and genes encoding their interacting protein partners at central synapses as genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders. This proposal will characterize novel and innovative autism mouse models that allow for brain development to take place with a genetic mutation. These particular models allow for reversal of the mutation at various times during brain development and ultimately in specific brain regions. The goal is to narrow the developmental critical period during which such mutations lead to altered brain function and atypical behavior. This information will allow scientists to focus specifically on the time periods and brain regions critical for generation of atypical behavior. In addition, these studies will substantiate feasibility of genetic and certain pharmacological approaches to treatment of a genetic form of autism. Progress to date is substantial in that the genetically reversible mutant mouse models related to autism have been established and characterization has begun.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  It is critical to better understand genetic causes of human autism and to use animal models of such causes to identify treatments. This 5-year R01 renewal proposal capitalizes on significant progress in creating and characterizing animal models of autism that will allow us to rapidly advance this field. Novel genetic animal models have been created that now allow for precise control over genetic mutations and reversal of these genetic mutations at any time during development of the brain and in any brain region allowing extensive characterization of these new models for a complete understanding of when during brain development things go awry and where in the brain things go awry.,2019,575019,387218,187801,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autism; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric,Craig M Powell
1R01MH118563-01,Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other
cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered
neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal
cortical regions involved in social behaviors.
 One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social
interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and
inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated
in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by
impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses.
Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic
connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the
vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we
will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction.
We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO
mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction
deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT
mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics,
ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased
machine-learning behavioral assessments.
 We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the

1R43HL147791-01,Microfluidic Assay for Screening Vascular Cardiotoxicity,"Abstract
The overall objective of this study is to develop a novel, predictive in vitro platform for studying physiological
responses of endothelium mediated human cardiomyocytes toxicity to therapeutics. The proposed effort
specifically responds to NHLBI Small Business Topics of Special Interest HLS18-08.
A critical in vivo component lacking in conventional models used for cardiac toxicity is the absence of
endothelial cells and perivascular cells in communication with cardiomyocytes thereby limiting realistic
predictions. We propose to develop and demonstrate iPSCs-based microfluidic device and assay that will
accurately reproduce the physiological conditions of vascular and cardiac tissue interactions observed in vivo.
Phase I will culminate with a clear demonstration of endothelium mediated toxicity screening with physiological
relevant modulation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells caused by drug-induced interactions.
During Phase II, we will expand the platform further with culture of perivascular cells, and perform toxicity
screening with clinically relevant drugs followed by in vivo validation. We will also develop a framework for high
throughput assays by integration with micro well plates. A multi-disciplinary, partnership with expertise in
microfluidics cell-based assays, iPSC-based cardiomyocytes, native extracellular matrices, regenerative
medicine and cardiac toxicity with clinical relevance has been assembled to successfully meet the research
objectives. The end-product will be commercialized to researchers in industry and academia engaged in drug
discovery and drug delivery. The developed assay will also have critical applications in basic research, where it
can be used to identify molecular mechanisms and in drug discovery for development of therapeutics.","Project Narrative:

The overall goal of this study is to develop and demonstrate a novel, predictive in vitro organotypic 3D-culture

current Transwell based static and microfluidic assays, our commercially available SynBBB model enables
real-time visualization and quantitation of transport/permeation under physiological microcirculatory size and
flow conditions, while simultaneously simplifying on chip and off chip analysis. The apical side provides a 3D
architecture of endothelial cells while the basolateral side supports 3D glial cell co-cultures.
Phase I study seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of the SynBBB model for predicting central nervous system
toxicity of essential and heavy metals specifically across the BBB. It will culminate with a clear demonstration
of the model with validation against in vivo studies. During Phase II, we will develop a higher throughput

1R01HL147549-01,Macrophage Circadian Clock Disruption and Inflammation in Heart Failure,"Monocytes and macrophages fundamentally originating from the bone marrow and spleen - pro-inflammatory
Ly6Chi monocytes in mice (CD14hi cells in humans) and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)+ monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDMs) - contribute importantly to tissue injury and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in chronic heart
failure (HF), suggesting that these cells may represent therapeutic targets for immunomodulation. Importantly,
monocytes and MDMs exhibit circadian variation in multiple functional parameters, in large part due to a robust
cell-autonomous molecular clock, which is regulated by the CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional complex and subject
to an autoregulatory loop involving Rev-erba. Notably, whether the intrinsic circadian clock in monocytes and
MDMs is disrupted in HF and its mechanistic link to inflammation and disease progression is entirely unknown.
Our pilot studies suggest that monocyte and MDM clock disruption is characteristic of HF, and that
monocyte/macrophage Bmal1 (and subsequent Rev-erba/b) loss is associated with upregulation of the immune
activator E4bp4, and aggravation of LV remodeling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the
monocyte/MDM clock is dysfunctional in HF, leading to pathological inflammation and cardiac remodeling in a
REV-ERBa-linked and E4BP4-dependent manner, and that clock correction is a key molecular target for
immunomodulation. Three Aims will test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define alterations in the monocyte
circadian clock in HF using a murine coronary ligation model, and test whether monocyte/macrophage clock
disruption in myeloid-specific Bmal1 knockout (MBK) mice exacerbates inflammation, innate immune expansion,
and LV remodeling during HF. We will also measure inflammatory and clock genes in CD14hi monocytes from
humans with HF. In Aim 2, we will delineate the role of monocyte-localized E4bp4, a clock-controlled
inflammatory transcription factor and direct target of Rev-erba, in HF by assessing inflammation and LV
remodeling after coronary ligation in myeloid-specific E4bp4 knockout (MEK) mice. We will also evaluate whether
monocyte E4BP4 suppression rescues the aggravated LV remodeling observed with monocyte/macrophage
clock disruption by inducing HF in myeloid-specific Bmal1/E4bp4 double knockout mice. In Aim 3, we will
mechanistically establish the potential of targeting the circadian clock as a therapeutic approach in HF, by testing
whether treatment with SR9009, a synthetic REV-ERBa/b agonist, favorably modulates monocytes and MDMs
and ameliorates or reverses LV remodeling in wild-type mice with established HF, and then in MEK HF mice to
determine whether the effects of SR9009 require monocyte/macrophage E4bp4. We will also evaluate the ex
vivo activation responses of human HF CD14hi monocytes to the agonist. These studies will further our
understanding of how changes in the macrophage circadian clock modulate both inflammation and disease
progression in HF, and test novel approaches to immunomodulation using genetic and pharmacological
strategies to correct the pathological changes induced by clock disruption.","Relevance: Heart failure (HF), a progressive disease with a poor prognosis, is characterized by inflammation
and the expansion and activation of tissue-injurious and pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages both
globally and in the heart; however, the underlying reasons for (and therapeutic approaches to) modulate such
heightened activity remain unclear. We will test a novel hypothesis for the pathogenesis of inflammation in HF -
that it is driven primarily by disruption of the monocyte/macrophage molecular circadian clock that is responsible
for the rhythmic regulation of their cellular machinery. We further propose that therapeutically targeting specific
clock components (e.g., REV-ERB) or clock-controlled genes (e.g., E4bp4) represents a better approach to
alleviating inflammation in HF.",2019,582677,392375,190302,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Genetics; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease,Sumanth D Prabhu; Martin E Young
5T32HL129948-03,Basic and Translational Science in Heart Failure,"ABSTRACT
While cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, the
mortality burden of specific diseases has changed over the last few decades. Despite a decline in death rates
for coronary artery disease since 1970, heart failure (HF) prevalence and mortality have increased. The
expanded clinical burden, prognostic import, and health needs related to HF highlight the importance of
complementary training of teams of basic, clinical, and population scientists. Hence, we propose the Basic
and Translational Science in Heart Failure (BTSHF) Training Program, designed to specifically mentor
clinical and research post-doctoral trainees in broad aspects of HF pathophysiology (disease mechanisms),
diagnostics (biomarkers and imaging), therapeutics (pharmacological, biological, devices), epidemiology
(population science, personalized medicine, and clinical outcomes), as well as relevant methodologies
(disease models, stem cells, â€˜omicsâ€™ approaches, and biostatistics). At the heart of the training program reside
three thematic cores - Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms; New Diagnostics and Therapeutics; and Clinical
Epidemiology and Outcomes. In close collaboration with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Office
of Postdoctoral Education and Center for Clinical and Translational Science, the 2 to 3 year BTSHF training
program has been specifically tailored to foster the development of future translational researchers
with scientific interests in HF. This includes establishment of a new interdisciplinary didactic course that
exposes trainees to cutting edge scientific techniques (e.g., non-invasive imaging, translational study design,
large data set analysis) and concepts (e.g., cardiometabolics, epigenetics, inflammation, tissue regeneration).
The program also takes advantage of multiple seminar series and symposia organized by various UAB
Departments and Centers, including the Comprehensive Cardiovascular Center. A diverse group of primary
faculty from multiple Departments/Schools have been assembled, who possess established track records in
HF related research and/or mentorship, as well as several secondary and junior faculty, whose collective
expertise span the three scientific cores. Highly meritorious MD and PhD fellows will be recruited and
matched with a mentoring team consisting of four complementary faculty mentors from the distinct
scientific cores, including one junior faculty. Trainee progress and mentorship effectiveness will be evaluated
at regular intervals, and facilitated throughout the training period by established mechanisms, including
mentoring roundtables. The proposed program is enriched further by the highly collaborative and
interdisciplinary environment afforded by our institution, which has a longstanding track record in both
cardiovascular and translational research, as well as in mentorship of future independent researchers and
scientific leaders. Establishment of the BTSHF program will ensure adequate training of future
translational researchers armed with the appropriate skills to tackle the growing HF epidemic.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01ES030084-01,Repair of Environmentally Induced Mitochondrial DNA Damage,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 This proposal connects metabolic dysfunction to the regulation of repair following mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) damage caused by environmental toxicants. Environmental agents such as ionizing radiation,
chemicals found in cigarette smoke, herbicides, and heavy metals as well as normal cellular metabolic
processes, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. ROS cause damage to cellular DNA, which if not
properly repaired, can trigger genome instability and the progression of metabolic diseases including
neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and cancer. MtDNA is more susceptible than its nuclear counterpart to
oxidative stress. The base excision repair (BER) pathway mends damaged bases in both nuclear and
mitochondrial compartments. Specialized enzymes called DNA glycosylases play a critical role in initializing
BER by excising damaged bases and mediating other aspects of the repair process via essential
protein:protein interactions.
 We will determine the role and regulation of two DNA glycosylases, NEIL1 and NEIL2, in the repair of
mtDNA. We hypothesize that the NEIL enzymes form unique and distinct complexes with mitochondrial
proteins that are responsible for mtDNA replication and transcription including mitochondrial single-stranded
DNA binding protein (mtSSB), transcription factor A (TFAM), polymerase Î³ (PolÎ³), and the twinkle helicase.
Our central hypothesis is that complex formation between the NEIL enzymes and mitochondrial proteins drives
repair ahead of the replication/ transcription forks and is regulated via (de)acetylation. To address this
hypothesis, we will examine the functional interactions between the NEIL enzymes and the named
mitochondrial proteins via structure-driven analyses. Experiments using protein painting, small angle-X-ray
scattering, and X-ray crystallography will be used to determine the structures of complexes formed between
NEIL1, mtSSB, PolÎ³, and Twinkle as well as between NEIL2, TFAM, and PolÎ³. Next, we will test the impact of
(de)acetylation on NEIL function. High levels of acetyl-coenzyme A in the mitochondrion drives chemical
acetylation of proteins and our preliminary data suggests that NEIL2 is modified in this manner. Deacetylation
of the NEIL proteins by the NAD+-dependent sirtuin enzymes regulates protein function and will be explored
here. Cellular metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and environmental toxicants that cause an increase in
ROS levels adversely impact the bioavailability of key metabolites (NAD+) required for deacetylation; a pivotal
aspect of our research. Lastly, we will study the localization of the NEIL enzymes under conditions of
environmentally induced oxidative stress and their impact on mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential,
and morphology. This will shed light on essential nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk that results from oxidative
stress.
 MtDNA repair is a budding field, with the NEIL enzymes placed at the forefront of the repair process by
our recent discoveries. By addressing critical questions of NEIL complex formation, regulation of activity, and
localization, the proposed studies will provide the molecular insight necessary for understanding how the repair
of mtDNA damage caused by environmental toxicants prevents mutagenesis and offers a novel connection
between mitochondrial metabolic function and mtDNA repair.","Project Narrative
Public Health Relevance Statement
Mitochondrial diseases can manifest in many forms ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to obesity and
cancer. The mitochondrial genome is under constant stress owing to its location within the mitochondrion as
well as from exposure to environmental toxicants. When mitochondrial DNA is not accurately repaired,
mutagenesis and instability result, which gives rise to diseases. The work described here addresses how two
specialized enzymes NEIL1 and NEIL2 are regulated within the mitochondrion to help coordinate the repair of
oxidized DNA damage caused by environmental toxicants.

5R01GM118361-04,Genetic Regulation of Unconventional Prostaglandin Metabolism,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostaglandins (PGs) are clinically important lipid signaling molecules derived from membrane phospholipids. They have been implicated in a variety of developmental, physiological, and pathophysiological processes, including fertilization,
inflammation, metabolic disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PG isomers called isoprostanes are used as markers of oxidative stress. The current dogma is that PG-endoperoxide synthase (i.e. Cox) enzymes are the sole enzymes capable of initiating PG synthesis. However, this model had not been directly tested. Cox enzymes are targets of NSAIDs, widely used drugs for treating pain and inflammation. This application is driven by the unexpected discovery that C. elegans and mice synthesize specific PGF2Î± stereoisomers independent of Cox. C. elegans PGs have a critical role in fertilization and are dynamically regulated by pheromones and nutritional cues. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the Cox- independent PG biosynthesis mechanism. The central hypothesis is that an evolutionarily conserved Cox- independent metabolic pathway synthesizes PGF1Î± and PGF2Î± stereoisomers in a tissue-specific fashion. Three independent aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis. Aim 1 will identify genes essential for Cox-independent PG synthesis. The simple roundworm model C. elegans will be used for these studies because a genetic screening method has been developed to identify these genes. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will determine PG levels in mutant worms. Gene replacement experiments will assess functional conservation of mouse homologs. Aim 2 will identify biochemical steps in C. elegans PG metabolism. Stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry methods will identify PG metabolites. Nuclear magnetic resonance will determine stereostructure of major worm PGs. Aim 3 will investigate Cox- independent PG metabolism in mice. LC-MS/MS will identify PGs in Cox null mouse pups and isolated tissues. Pharmacologic studies in Cox null embryonic fibroblast cultures will test pathway sensitivity to NSAIDs. A long- term goal is develop the mouse as a model to study Cox-independent PGs. These studies will help define a second widely used pathway for PG synthesis and provide a roadmap for delineating this pathway in humans. The results will provide genetic tools for discovering new PG functions in development and disease. By transforming PG biochemistry, new avenues will emerge for developing therapeutics to treat cancer, glaucoma, cardiovascular diseases, and other human disorders.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostaglandins are important lipid signaling molecules that control a wide array of biological processes, such as blood clotting, pain sensation, labor contraction, and inflammation. Conventional wisdom is that prostaglandin synthesis is solely mediated by cyclooxygenase enzymes, which are the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

However, despite effective suppressive therapy, HIV has been known to exist in a state of latency, with the best characterized latent reservoir being the resting memory CD4+ T cells. These resting cells produce HIV when their resting state is reversed following cellular activation. To achieve a cure for HIV disease, the latent reservoir of HIV needs to be identified and eliminated.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent reservoir, a reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM assay (Infectious Units Per Million) performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV. However, QVOA measurements require large volumes of blood, are expensive, tedious, and labor intensive and therefore not the assay of choice for many laboratories conducting HIV eradication research.  NIAID has a requirement to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved.

By the time they finish high school, approximately half of all high school-aged adolescents have tried illicit
substances at least once in their lifetime. During adolescence, the brain undergoes rapid development and
maturation, which may be disrupted by alcohol and substance use. The majority of investigations in this area
have focused on the effects of heavy use by recruiting individuals who are in treatment for an alcohol or
substance use disorder. Therefore, there is relatively little information on the effects of more normative use of
alcohol and substances during adolescence. Further, there has been very little work done to investigate the
relationship between race and sex differences and the effects of alcohol and substance on the brain. The long-
term goal of the current project is to better understand the impact of alcohol and substance use on the
developing brain and to use that knowledge to improve targeted prevention and intervention efforts. The
proposed project will investigate the central hypothesis that alcohol and substance use during adolescence has
diffuse effects on brain structure and function which can be seen in emerging adulthood, particularly within
regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. The central hypothesis will be addressed by
examining: 1) the relationship between adolescent alcohol and substance use and functional brain connectivity
in young adulthood; 2) the relationship adolescent alcohol and substance use has to brain structure in young
adulthood; and 3) the impact race and sex differences in the neural outcomes of alcohol and substance use.
Accomplishing these three aims will provide a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent alcohol and
substance use and its effects on the brain, as well as provide insight into whether race or sex differences exist
in the neural effects of such use. The aims of the proposed project will be completed in conjunction with a
formal research training plan, sponsored by Dr. David Knight, Dr. Sylvie Mrug, and Dr. Karen Cropsey. The
training plan focuses on developing 1) expertise in alcohol and substance use research; 2) knowledge and

5SC2GM130475-02,Protein Kinase A (PKA) Signaling in the Cystogenesis and Dedifferentiation of Proximal Tubules,"Project Summary
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects more than 600,000 people in the USA and is
caused by mutations primarily in genes PKD1 and PKD2. In ADPKD, cysts and fibrosis replace the renal
parenchyma leading to renal pathology and failure. Currently, in the USA there are no approved therapies to
stop or slow cyst growth. Increased levels of second messenger cAMP is one of the key initial events associated
with PKD mutations. cAMP activates multiple signaling pathways including the Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway
that results in phosphorylation of transcription factor Creb and other substrates. Cysts may arise from different
tubular segments in PKD such as proximal tubules (PTs) and collecting ducts (CDs). Potential therapies to
modulate cAMP/PKA signaling in CD-derived cysts are under clinical trials however, strategies to control
cAMP/PKA signaling in PT-derived cysts remain largely undefined. Furthermore, early interventions during
childhood to reduce cystic burden have been recommended to preserve maximum renal function. Available data
suggest that PT-derived cysts predominate in the developing kidney. Our recently published studies suggest that
cAMP-mediated PKA activation plays a key role in the cystogenesis of PTs of the developing kidneys. Our
studies also suggest that PKA contributes to the dedifferentiation of PT cystic segments of the developing and
developed kidney, a process known to contribute to cystogenesis. Proximity of PKA to cAMP makes it a suitable
therapeutic target however, the direct role of PKA in PT cystogenesis has not been investigated. The objective
of this proposal is to test the overarching hypothesis that aberrant cAMP/PKA signaling is a key factor driving
PT de-differentiation that promotes cyst formation in the kidney. This hypothesis will be tested in the following
two aims. Aim 1: Examine the direct effect of PKA in the dedifferentiation of PTs in culture. We will determine
whether modulation of PKA activity in in vitro cultures is sufficient and/or necessary for PT dedifferentiation as
an early step to cystogenesis. Aim 2: Determine the effects of constitutive PKA activation on the cystogenesis
and dedifferentiation of PTs in vivo. We will determine whether constitutive activation of PKA in differentiated
PTs is sufficient to induce their de-differentiation, leading to cystogenesis as well as initiate multi-faceted cellular
responses such as fibrosis and inflammation-associated changes from the surrounding renal parenchyma.
These studies will define a direct novel role of PKA in the dedifferentiation and cystogenesis of PT and establish
PKA as a potential therapeutic target. These studies will lay the foundation for the future studies that will
determine whether modulation of PKA activity in PTs exacerbates or ameliorates cystogenesis and
dedifferentiation in a PKD mouse model. Future studies will also focus to identify novel substrates of PKA
implicated in the dedifferentiation and cystogenesis of PTs.","Narrative

5R01HL131110-04,E2F1 in BM progenitor cell differentiation and cardiovascular repair,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of ongoing cell-therapy trials for ischemic heart disease (IHD) use bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells (PCs); however, the efficacy remains modest. Major barriers to effective cell therapy include limited potential of PCs to differentiate to ECs and functional impairments of PCs from patients' background disease, such as diabetes which accounts for 40-65% of heart failure patients in the US. Recently we found that the E2F1 transcription factor contributes to EPC dysfunction in diabetic conditions by activating the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases 2 and 4 (PDK2/4). Deletion of E2F1 (E2F1-/-) in BM PCs leads to reduced PDK2/4 expression and increased oxygen consumption. These results are extremely exciting because PCs normally reside in their niche at a relatively ""quiescent"" state and rely primarily on glycolysis as fuel source (even with  sufficient oxygen supply), and recent reports suggest that a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation is required for their functional activation and differentiation. Indeed, we found that the altered metabolic activities in E2F1-/- PCs are associated with a dramatic increase in the capacity of endothelial differentiation. Remarkably, after administered to mice with myocardial infarction, E2F1-/- PCs generated significantly more ECs in the ischemic myocardium than WT PCs. Furthermore, we have identified that Sam68, an adaptor protein involved in high-fat diet (HFD) - induced insulin resistance, interacts with E2F1 and enhances E2F1-mediated PDK2/4 promoter activity. Collectively, accumulating evidence in the literature indicates that adult BM PCs, when recruited at sites of injury, are not readily differentiating int vascular cells despite the environmental angiogenic cues, and our results suggest that this ""checkpoint"" is enforced, at least partially, by E2F1-mediated metabolic control; thus inhibition o E2F1 may re-set the metabolic switch to permit PC differentiation and vascular repair. The goal of this application is to establish the role of the E2F1-PDK2/4 pathway in BM PC energy metabolism and differentiation, and to determine whether approaches that target this pathway could enhance the effectiveness of BM PC therapy for IDH with concurrent diabetes. Our central hypothesis is that E2F1 activates PDK2/4 expression, thus inhibiting glucose utilization and PC differentiation in ischemic reperfused heart, and that targeted inhibition of the E2F1-PDK2/4 pathway can promotes PC differentiation and cardiovascular repair. A series of experiments are proposed to (Aim 1) characterize the role and the underlying molecular mechanisms of E2F1-mediated PDK2/4 expression in the regulation of BM PC metabolism, differentiation, and function and to (Aim 2) evaluate the effectiveness of targeting the E2F1- PDK2/4 pathway for enhancement of BM PC recruitment, differentiation, and PC-mediated cardiovascular repair. We expect that this study will advance the field by establishing the crucial role of cellular metabolim in BM PC differentiation and opening new avenues into research for better cardiovascular cell therapy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of death nationally, occurs when vessels are unable to deliver a sufficient supply of blood to the heart, which also limits the capacity of the heart to regenerate tissues damaged by a cardiovascular event or disease.

5R01HL130052-04,GOLPH3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology and vascular disease,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Golgi apparatus (also known as the Golgi complex or Golgi body) is an important cytoplasmic organelle that is of great interest to all scientists for its key roles in the biosynthesis, transporting and sorting of both lipids and proteins. As a consequence of these important roles, any changes in its proteome can negatively affect its functions and in turn lead to many diseases. Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is a highly conserved 34-kDa protein initially identified in 2000 through proteomic characterizations of the Golgi apparatus, which is located at the Golgi membrane as well as in the cytosolic pool. In the past 5 years, GOLPH3 has become a hot research area, because its strong biological functions are identified in many cancers. Although GOLPH3 is a critical molecule in eukaryotic cells and in the pathogenesis of many cancers, no studies have been performed to determine its roles in cardiovascular cell biology and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this proposal is to determine the biological roles of GOLPH3 in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) biology and in proliferative vascular disease. Our preliminary studies have identified for the first time that GOLPH3 is highly expressed in VSMCs and vascular walls, and its expression is significantly increased in proliferative VSMCs, balloon-injured rat carotid arteries,
atherosclerotic mouse aortas and atherosclerotic human arteries. In addition, GOLPH3 has a strong effect on VSMC proliferation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesized that the Lin-28/Let-7d star axis is involved in the up-regulation of GOLPH3 in proliferative VSMCs and in vascular walls with proliferative vascular disease. GOLPH3 is a critical novel molecule in VSMC cellular functions and in the development of vascular neointimal growth and atherosclerosis via its downstream signaling pathway, Akt/mTOR. Our hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data. We will further test this novel hypothesis by the following 3 Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 i to test the effects of GOLPH3 on the dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration and apoptosis of cultured VSMCs in vitro; Specific Aim 2 is to determine the effects of GOLPH3 on cellular functions of VSMCs, acute vascular neointima growth induced by vascular injury, and chronic atherosclerosis in vivo; and Specific Aim 3 is to determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for GOLPH3-mediated cellular effects on VSMCs and vascular effects on proliferative vascular disease both in vitro and in vivo. The study will provide a new molecular mechanism of atherosclerosis by analysis a novel atherosclerosis signaling pathway Lin-28/Let-7d star/GOLPH3/Akt/mTOR, which is centralized by the abundant Golgi protein, GOLPH3. GOLPH3 may be a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerotic vascular disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of proposal is to determine the biological roles of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) biology and in proliferative vascular disease.

5R01HL138990-03,E2F2 and Vascular Function,"Project Summary
Despite intensive investigation, hypertension remains a major public health problem. The pathogenesis of
hypertension is incompletely characterized, and the potential role of transcriptional mechanisms is particularly
unclear. Previously, we have published evidence that the E2F2 transcription factor is crucial for maintaining
blood pressure (BP) homeostasis: mice carrying a deletion mutation of E2F2 are hypertensive, and their
arterial vessels are hypercontractile. Historically, E2F2 is considered a cell-cycle regulator; however, in
endothelial cells (ECs), E2F2 promotes the expression of endothelial converting enzyme 1b (ECE-1b), the
deactivating ECE-1 isoform, thus suppressing ECE-1 activity and endothelin-1 (ET-1) biogenesis. Our results
also suggest that Sam68, a Src-familyâ€“kinase (SFK) substrate, interacts with E2F2 and represses E2F2-
mediated ECE-1b expression. Consistently, we found that Sam68-knockout mice are hypotensive. These
findings are particularly exciting, because clinical studies have identified an E2F binding-site polymorphism in
the ECE-1b promoter and another independent polymorphism in the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK, a major
physiological inhibitor of SFK) gene that are strongly associated with human hypertension. Collectively, our
results and observations reported by other laboratories may have identified a previously unknown mechanism
of BP control that is governed by the Sam68/E2F2â€“ECE-1b pathway, and deregulation of this pathway may
contribute to BP disorders, including hypertension in humans. However, despite strong evidence indicating that
E2F2 and Sam68 regulates vessel contractility, the Sam68/E2F2â€“ECE-1b pathway has not been explicitly
linked to BP regulation, and the mechanisms by which Sam68/E2F2 signaling regulates ECE-1b expression
and vascular function remain uncharacterized. The objective of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the E2F2-mediated regulation of vascular function and BP. Our central hypothesis is that E2F2
recruits both co-activators and co-repressors (e.g., Sam68) to the ECE-1b promoter, thereby regulating ECE-1
activity and preserving a normal contractile state in arteries. Furthermore, dysregulation of E2F2 and the
E2F2/Sam68 interaction contributes to BP disorders by inducing aberrations in ECE-1 activity and ET-1
biogenesis. We will accomplish our objective with a series of experiments organized under three specific aims:
1) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which E2F2 regulates ECE-1b expression; 2) to define the
functional significance of the Sam68/E2F2 signaling in arterial ECs and intact vessels; and 3) to determine the
consequences of dysfunctional Sam68/E2F2â€“ECE-1b pathway on BP control. We anticipate that the work
proposed in this project will extensively characterize the novel SFK/Sam68â€“E2F2/ECE-1b pathway in the
regulation of vascular function and BP control, and may potentially reveal new targets for future research into
preventive and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of hypertension.","Narrative

5R01EY025756-04,Early detection of glaucoma progression using a novel individualized approach,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the presence and rate of glaucoma progression influences treatment decisions, the methods currently available to detect and monitor progression are imprecise and do not allow clinicians to make accurate assessments of the status of their patients. The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the time needed to detect
glaucoma progression. We developed an individualized model to detect progression that uses structural and functional data jointly. The specific aims are 1) To determine whether an individualized approach to identify glaucoma progression leads to earlier detection of progression compared to current methods based on population statistics, 2) To determine which combination of structural and functional parameters identifies glaucoma progression at the earliest point in time, and 3) To determine the shortest period of time needed for our individualized approach to detect glaucoma progression. Specific aims 1 and 2 will use the data prospectively collected in two large multi-center NIH-funded studies: the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. These studies are ideally suited to achieve these aims because of the large sample of longitudinal structural and functional data. For specific aim 3, we will prospectively collect data from glaucoma patients seen at our institution. Our central hypothesis is that combining structural and functional data within the framework of an individualized model will improve our ability to detect glaucoma progression more rapidly. The dynamic structure-function model is innovative in that it is individualized and robust to assumptions about the nature of glaucoma progression. We hypothesize that our individualized dynamic structure-function model will lead to the detection of progression at an earlier point in time compared to other currently available methods. We also hypothesize that different combinations of structural and functional tests will lead to the detection of glaucoma progression at an earlier point in time compared to other combinations. Finally, we hypothesize that our individualize approach will reduce the amount of time needed to detect glaucoma progression. This project will have a significant impact on the clinical management of glaucoma patients, providing clinicians with an accurate and precise method to detect glaucoma progression. This work is also highly relevant for determining clinical trial endpoints when assessing the effectiveness of new medical or surgical treatment for glaucoma.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because glaucoma is one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide and in the United States. Developing accurate and precise methods to detect and monitor glaucoma progression will be a substantial asset to clinicians and will be a powerful tool to assist them in
their mission of preserving sight. This project is directly relevant to the mission of the National
Institutes of Health, which seeks to enhance health and reduce illness and disability, and it perfectly aligns with the mission of the National Eye Institute, which is dedicated to supporting research on blinding eye diseases and visual disorders with the ultimate goal of preserving sight.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Precision Medicine; Prevention,Lyne  Racette
1R35GM133719-01,Molecular Imaging Agents for Monitoring Lysine Demethylases in Cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein lysine methylation is a reversible process controlled by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs or methyl
writers) and lysine demethylases (KDMs or methyl erasers) in human cells. Most studies on these KMTs and
KDMs have focused mainly on their functions inside the nucleus. More than half of these KMTs and KDMs,
which are present in the nucleus are also localized in the cytoplasm but very little is known about their
functions in this subcellular compartment. The abnormalities in these enzymes are directly associated with
cancers, inflammation and other diseases. Despite the critical importance of the KDMs in different subcellular
compartments, there is a substantial gap between their global analysis and effective methods available to
achieve it. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how
â€œlysine methylomeâ€ is maintained at a subcellular level and how these chemical markers modulate cell
signaling. The current focus is to develop a new class of chemical tools that report on KDM activities in living
cells at a subcellular level. This new family of chemical tools will be deployed to determine the activity of KDMs
in different subcellular compartments, and their regulation by substrates, and local cofactors. The primary
biological interests right now deal with roles of KDMs outside of the nucleus, in particular, the cytoplasm and
mitochondria, while pursuing mechanistic studies in the context of cancer. The proposed research contains
four innovations to decode the intracellular KDM activities with subcellular resolution. First, is the development
of new small molecule probes with unique chemoselectivity towards lysine, and high stability towards
hydrolysis, which is ideal for studying KDMs in cells. Second, is the development of molecular imaging agents
to monitor the activity of KDMs and how they are regulated inside the cells. Third, is to determine the activity of
the specific KDMs by incorporating recognition elements on the probe. Fourth, is the development of organelle
selective molecular imaging agents to study the role of KDMs in different subcellular compartments and their
subcellular localization, which is currently impossible to determine with existing techniques. These probes are
capable of determining KDM activities and their role in various diseased states thus of immense therapeutic
interest. This research will have extensive applications in biomedical field by providing a better understanding
of KDMs functions in different subcellular compartments, the molecular mechanisms of diseases, thus assist in
the discovery of novel protein biomarkers, and combination-therapy for the treatment of cancer.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R21AI146743-01,Importance of immune-cell lipid signaling in events leading to type 1 diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a consequence of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet Î²-cells and the underlying causes for this process are incompletely understood. Our work suggests novel lipid signaling provided by macrophages and CD4+ T-cells impacts T1D incidence. In particular, the relevant lipids appear to be generated by the Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2Î² (iPLA2Î²), which is expressed in immune cells. iPLA2Î² hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position to release a lysophospholipid and a fatty acid. When the fatty acid is arachidonic acid, it can be metabolized to generate bioactive oxidized lipids, or eicosanoids, many of which are pro-inflammatory. We find that (a) an iPLA2Î²-selective inhibitor, when administered to spontaneous diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice preserves Î²-cell mass, reduces T1D incidence and insulitis, (b) iPLA2Î² activity promotes M1 macrophage pro-inflammatory phenotype and TNFÎ± production from CD4+ T-cells, (c) macrophage production of select pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGE2, leukotrienes, 12-HETE, DHETs) is increased in NOD and reduced in macrophages with reduced iPLA2Î² (NOD.iPLA2Î²-/+), (d) T1D incidence is reduced in NOD.iPLA2Î²-/+, (e) adoptive transfer of NOD.iPLA2Î²-/- macrophages or splenocytes decreases T1D incidence and improves glucose tolerance. We hypothesize that iPLA2Î²-derived lipids (iDLs) produced by CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and macrophages play critical roles in T1D development and will address this under the following Aims: 1. Determine the contribution of CD4+/CD8+ T-cell-iDLs to T1D. We propose to utilize CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell preparations from WT and iPLA2Î²-deficient NOD to (a) determine the requirement of T-cell iDLs for diabetes induction, (b) quantitate T-cell lipid production and identify the iDLs, (c) assess the impact of these select iDLs on islet function and survival. 2. Determine the contribution of macrophage-iDLs to T1D. We propose to (a) utilize macrophage preparations from WT and iPLA2Î²-deficient NOD to determine the temporal requirement of macrophage iDLs on diabetes induction, (b) assess diabetes development in NOD with selective deficiency in macrophage iPLA2Î², (c) determine the impact of select macrophage iDLs on islet function and survival. 3. Assess the impact of CD4+/CD8+ T-cell-or macrophage-derived iDLs on islet iPLA2Î². Preliminary results suggest that iPLA2Î² is induced in stressed Î²-cells by NFÎºB, and PGE2 has been reported to induce NFÎºB. We will test the possibility that macrophage and/or CD4+/CD8+ T-cell iDLs induce Î²-cell iPLA2Î², which would be expected to participate in maintaining and amplifying immune responses. We will utilize adoptive transfer, systems level lipidomics, conditional knockouts, immunoblotting, message, IF, and select inhibition of lipid-generating enzymes protocols to address these Aims.

underlying causes for this process are not completely understood. Yet to be defined are the roles of lipids
generated in Î²-cells and immune cells in this process. Islet Î²-cells and immune cells express Ca2+-
independent phospholipase A2Î² (iPLA2Î²), which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position to
generate lipids that can promote inflammatory responses. We hypothesize that iPLA2Î²-derived lipids (iDLs)
provide critical signals linking immune cells, Î²-cells, and ER stress with Î²-cell death associated with
autoimmune diabetes. In support, we find that (a) iPLA2Î² is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and
cytokine-mediated ER stress and Î²-cell apoptosis are reversed by iPLA2Î² inhibition, (b) Î²-cells and immune
cells in a spontaneous model of autoimmune diabetes (non-obese diabetic mice, NOD) express higher iPLA2Î²
during the pre-diabetic phase, (c) administration of an iPLA2Î²-selective inhibitor (FKGK18) to NOD mice
preserves Î²-cells mass and reduces diabetes incidence, insulitis, and autoimmunity, (d) pre-treatment of
immunodeficient mice with FKGK18 reduces adoptive transfer of diabetes by T-cells, (e) overexpression of
iPLA2Î² in Î²-cells accelerates and increases the incidence of diabetes in NOD, (f) reduction of iPLA2Î² in NOD
mice mimics the protective effects seen with FKGK18 administration, (g) M1 inflammatory macrophage
polarization is reduced with iPLA2Î² deficiency, and (h) there is feedback regulation between iPLA2Î² and ER
stress, and between inflammation-related transcription factors and iPLA2Î². Our hypothesis will be tested using
whole animal (mouse models with altered iPLA2Î² expression on a NOD or immunodeficient-NOD background),
mechanism-based in vitro, and translational (human T1D and autoantibody positive but not diabetic subjects)
approaches through the following Aims: 1. Delineate the impact of iDLs generated by immune cells on
autoimmune diabetes development. 2. Delineate the impact of iDLs generated by Î²-cells on autoimmune
diabetes development. 3. Delineate the cellular mechanisms by which iDLs induce Î²-cell death in autoimmune
diabetes. 4. Assess the contribution of iDLs to human T1D development. These Aims will encompass
generation of islet and immune cell lipidome during autoimmune diabetes development; adoptive transfer
protocols to distinguish importance of iDLs generated by immune cells and Î²-cells to diabetes development;
co-culture assays to assess impact of iDLs on islet antigenicity; protein and message analyses to address link
between ER stress, iDLs, and inflammation; ChIP and CRISPR/Cas9 analyses to examine transcriptional
regulation of iPLA2Î²; and human subjects to asses the potential of iPLA2Î² as a biomarker of T1D susceptibility.

1R43ES030652-01,Microfluidic nasal epithelial ALI model to evaluate inhalationtoxicity caused by engineered nanomaterials,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The twenty-first century has seen a global rise in human health problems caused by air pollution, and urban
exposure to aerosolized particulate matter (PM) has been strongly linked to respiratory disease. Significant
pulmonary health risks are associated with ultrafine PM (PM<2.5 Âµm or PM2.5), whose levels exceed global urban
air-quality standards for the majority of the worldâ€™s population and can lead to premature mortality. With the
rapid growth of the nanotechnology sector, the release of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs; 1-100 nm) into the
environment, deposition in the respiratory tract and the potential for toxicity are matters of growing concern. The
nasal cavity serves as one of the first physical barriers to inhaled ENMs, where aerosolized nanoparticles can
lodge in the nasal epithelial layer and induce toxicity responses. Although in vivo models have provided valuable
toxicological data using defined mixtures of nanoparticles, responses in animal models do not always correlate
to human toxicity responses. Hence, there is a growing need to develop, validate, and utilize new in vitro
alternatives that physiologically reproduce the nasal microenvironment and provide more economical, ethical,
and effective nanotoxicology platforms.
We propose to develop an in vitro assay for toxicological analysis of nasal epithelia after aerosolized ENM
exposure. During Phase I, we will demonstrate and test a vascularized airway microfluidic platform that
incorporates primary, differentiated, nasal epithelial cells grown in an air-liquid interface (ALI). Following
multiscale computational modeling of nanoparticle distribution dynamics in the human nasal cavity, we will
evaluate the distribution and toxicity of selected aerosolized ENMs using the nasal ALI microfluidic model.
Differential gene expression analysis of specific toxicology pathways will be performed, and the in vitro analysis
will be validated against available in vivo data. Gene expression data will be integrated into our high-fidelity
computational platform to demonstrate a systems-based analysis of ENM inhalation, distribution and toxicology.
In Phase II, we will expand the platform through device multiplexing and linking the nasal and previously-
developed lung ALI models together to form a combined respiratory inhalation model for nanotoxicology
screening. The developed in vitro microphysiological platform with multiple endpoint analysis will provide a
robust and cost-saving model for evaluating nanoparticle distribution, aggregation and respiratory toxicity
responses in humans.","Project Narrative:
Ultrafine particulate air pollutants such as engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) pose significant short- and long-

of the individual, geographic, and sociocontextual determinants of delays in achieving HIV viral
suppression (VS) in the Deep South region of the United States (US), an area carrying a
disproportionate burden of the countryâ€™s HIV epidemic. The proposal leverages a dynamic and
innovative collaboration of experienced investigators from the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and the HIV Divisions of the state health
departments in Alabama (AL), Louisiana (LA), and Mississippi (MS). This novel research proposal
utilizes a population-health approach to evaluate time to VS among newly diagnosed individuals
and integrates a mixed-methods approach to examine the socioeconomic, demographic, and
structural determinants of time to VS in this population in the development of an intervention to
accelerate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1)
Utilize HIV surveillance data collected by the statesâ€™ public health electronic HIV/AIDS Reporting
System (eHARS) to characterize geographic variability in time from HIV diagnosis to VS (<200
c/mL) among newly reported HIV cases among those age â‰¥13 years at diagnosis between
January 2014-December 2017 in AL, LA, and MS; 2) Identify individual and community-level
determinants of time to VS, incorporating quantitative geospatial coding methods, in AL, LA, and
MS among newly reported cases of HIV among those age â‰¥13 years at diagnosis from January
2014-December 2017 and contextualize these findings with qualitative key informant interviews
among persons living with HIV (PLWH), HIV treatment and social services providers, and other
community stakeholders in AL, LA, and MS; and 3) Engage stakeholders in developing a rapid
ART initiation program focusing upon localities in the Deep South with disproportionately longer
time from HIV diagnosis to VS. We will then incorporate these results in an R01 application testing
the implementation of a community-level rapid ART initiation program in the Deep South, focusing
on areas with longer time from HIV diagnosis to VS. Results of this research will lay the
groundwork for a larger implementation trial that will include rigorous evaluation of interventions
integrating clinical and public health systems aimed at improving time to VS in the US with
consideration for cost-effectiveness.","Project Narrative

5R01CA216234-03,Role of microbiota in therapy to ovarian cancer,"This proposal is submitted in response to the RFA, â€œResearch answers to NCI's provocative questionsâ€, in
particular, question 10, which asks, How do microbiota affect the response to cancer therapies? Our
preliminary data show that when tumor cells colonize the omentum, a fatty tissue in the peritoneal cavity, they
trigger a profound Treg-mediated tolerogenic response that prevents tumor-specific CD8 T cells from clearing
the tumor. Interestingly, this activity is specific for the omentum and involves a subset of Tregs known as
visceral-adipose tissue (VAT)-associated Tregs. VAT-associated Tregs uniquely express the transcription
factor PPARg and also express the ST2 component of the IL-33 receptor on their surface. These cells are
found exclusively in adipose tisses and are not found in conventional lymhoid organs (like the spleen and
lymph nodes) and are not found in peripheral sites. Importantly, VAT-associated Tregs are found in the
omentum, which is the site of ovarian cancer metastasis. In additioin to showing that VAT-associated Tregs
profoundly impair immunity to tumors that colonize the omentum, we also found that this activity is completely
dependent on gut microbiota. As a result, VAT-associated Treg activity is impaired and anti-tumor immunity is
restored in the omenta of germ-free mice. These results are surprising, since published data show that
microbiota promote (rather than prevent) the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy. These results were explained
by the ability of chemotherapy to compromise the gut epithelium, allowing the translocation of microbiota and
thereby triggering an IL-17 response, which facilitates the effects of chemotherapy on the clearance of tumors.
Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the microbiota play opposing roles in
promoting the immune suppressive Tregs under steady state conditions and by promoting the immune
stimulatory Th17 responses following chemotherapy. Moreover, these types of responses are location
dependent, with VAT-associated Tregs residing and responding primarily in fatty tissues like the omentum.
Thus, therapy for ovarian cancer, which routinely metastasizes to the omentum, may have different outcomes
than therapy to tumors in other locations. The experiments in this application test this hypothesis using a
spontaneous mouse model of ovarian cancer and determine the mechanistic links between the gut microbiota

1U19AI142737-01,"B cell Receptor repertoire, cloning and expression Core","Core C: B cell Receptor repertoire, cloning and expression Core
Project Summary
B cells express a widely diverse repertoire of B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) that can be further diversified by
isotype-switching of heavy chain constant regions and by somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the antigen-binding
domains of both heavy and light chains. B cells responding to protein antigens, such as viral antigens or
transplant antigens, are often expanded in the germinal center, which stringently selects for high affinity memory
B cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). In contrast, B cells responding to carbohydrate antigens, such
bacterial capsule components or blood group antigens, rarely enter the germinal center, but are nonetheless
highly-selected based on reactivity and cross-reactivity to various antigens. The processes of clonal expansion
and selection leads to the formation of B cell lineages that are related by BCR sequence and antigen-specificity.
Importantly, the characteristics of the BCR (V gene use, SHM, isotype, affinity, cross-reactivity) often determine
the functions of individual B cells, the tissues in which they reside, and the effector activities of the antibodies
they produce. However, we have a limited understanding of antigen-specific B cells in the non-lymphoid tissues
of humans. Therefore, the projects of this U19 will characterize B cells specific for different types of antigens
(glycans in Project 1, viral antigens in Project 2 and xenoantigens in Project 3), obtained from lymphoid, mucosal
and adipose tissues of normal human donors. Importantly, each project will determine the biochemical and
molecular characteristics of antibodies made by individual B cells, determine the clonal relationships between
antigen-specific B cells in different locations and use cytometric bead arrays to characterize the specificities,
cross-reactivities and affinities of antibodies made by individual B cells. In order to achieve these goals and
accelerate the research activities of each project, Core C will sort individual B cells from selected populations
into 384-well plates, amplify VH and VL gene segments, clone the amplicons into IgG expression vectors,
transfect the vectors into eukaryotic cells and produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Core C will also
perform BCR heavy chain repertoire sequencing on sorted memory B cells and ASCs from the same
tissues/donors used by the projects to sort antigen-specific B cells. Finally, Core C will develop cytometric bead
arrays to enable each project to assay the reactivity profiles of serum samples, culture supernatants and
monoclonal antibodies. Together, these activities will promote synergy and cooperation between projects
and will accelerate the pace of research by centralizing procedures that require specialized expertise and
instrumentation and by standardizing reagent development and production for each of the individual projects.",,2019,340081,229011,111070,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases,Troy D Randall
1R25GM130517-01,Expanding the Genomics Education Partnership: Regional Mentoring and Training Networks to Diversify Bioinformatics Education and Research,"Project Summary
The Genomics Education Partnership (GEP) is a nationwide faculty-driven collaboration that,
through training, mentorship, and outreach enables a broad range of institutions to introduce
bioinformatics into the undergraduate curriculum. Bioinformatics training extends the teaching of
molecular biology, strengthens students' computer science and math skills, and emphasizes the
power of computational approaches to explore biological systems. Inquiry-driven genomics
research engages students in scientific discovery while maintaining a widely distributed network
of teacher-scientists proficient in cutting edge experimental techniques. To date the GEP has
trained hundreds of faculty and impacted thousands of undergraduates. A majority of
participating faculty and students are women, and a third of GEP participant institutions are
minority-serving. From the start, the GEP has sought to:
 1. Introduce bioinformatics into the undergraduate curriculum through research
 2. Create a scalable system to tackle big projects with many students working in parallel
 3. Model â€œteam scienceâ€ through collaboration of a widely dispersed team
 4. Publish results in the scientific literature with faculty and student authors co-authors
 5. Publish assessment results to contribute to the scholarship of teaching and learning.
The GEP engages undergraduates in meaningful genomics research regardless of the
selectivity, location, or research focus of their institution, as supported by our published
assessments of education outcomes. This IPERT proposal will further enhance the GEP's
commitment to inclusive training of the scientific workforce. Specific Aim 1 will develop regional
nodes to recruit, train, and mentor inclusive local communities of faculty and students engaged
in genomics teaching and research. New faculty recruitment locally and at equity-promoting
national STEM conferences will focus on institutions that serve students from underrepresented
groups. Regional symposia will enable undergraduate students' direct dissemination of their
research and participation in the scientific community. Specific Aim 2 will broaden the GEP's
scientific scope, capacity, and dissemination by creating a new investigator-initiated,
undergraduate-powered gene annotation workflow, with an associated genomics curriculum,
that will enable community annotation projects for any eukaryotic genome, driving scalable team
science approaches to novel and emerging genomics questions. This new platform incorporates
rapid open-access micropublication of gene reports by undergraduate authors, further engaging
students in their science.","Project Narrative
To fulfill the promise of precision medicine, the US biomedical workforce needs scientists from
diverse backgrounds trained in computational analysis of complex genetic and genomic data.
Over the past decade the Genomics Education Partnership has trained thousands of
undergraduates across the US in genomics by creating and implementing curriculum and by
building a collaborative undergraduate-powered genomics research project. This proposal
seeks to expand the GEP with a focus on recruiting faculty from community colleges and
minority-serving institutions, to broaden our scientific scope by creating a platform for
community annotation of newly sequenced genomes, and to accelerate dissemination of
undergraduate research findings through micropublications.

1R21AT010517-01,Proprioceptive mechanisms underlying post-spinal manipulation response in an NGF-induced low back pain model,"Abstract.
Low back pain (LBP) is a major health problem in the United States costing annually over $50 billion in treatment-related costs and $100 billion in indirect costs (i.e. lost productivity). This national health crisis is further compounded by a recent over-reliance on prescription opioids for therapeutic pain management. High velocity low amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) is a non-pharmacological LBP approach recommended by a majority of clinical practice guidelines. However, a lack of knowledge concerning underlying neurophysiological mechanisms hinders wider clinical acceptance, usage, and optimization of this therapeutic approach. Proposed mechanisms of HVLA-SM efficacy include changes in muscle spindle sensitivity related to rapid stretch-induced stimulation of mechanoreceptors in muscle and/or other trunk tissues. Previous work in our lab has shed light on the relationship between the mechanical characteristics of HVLA-SM (thrust duration, thrust amplitude, thrust rate, preload magnitude & duration, and thrust contact site) and trunk muscle spindle afferent responsiveness in non-chemosensitized environments. Recently pilot studies using commercially available HVLA-SM devices with extremely short thrust durations of 2-3ms revealed a dichotomy among post-HVLA-SM return to baseline muscle spindle discharge. Distinct subpopulations of spindle afferents returned to baseline discharge post-HVLA-SM relatively rapidly (<2s), while others required substantially longer periods (>10s), which far outlasted the mechanical stimulus of HVLA-SM. The biological and/or biomechanical factors responsible for this post-HVLA-SM response dichotomy, as well as whether or not clinically relevant tissue chemosensitization acts to maximize these dichotomous post-HVLA-SM responses is currently unknown. A recently developed preclinical LBP model has been established using a translationally relevant pain molecule, nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is a neurotrophin associated with pain which is naturally upregulated after muscle damage, inflammation, and/or peripheral nerve injury. Injection of NGF into deep trunk musculature creates persistent (days/weeks), localized trunk hyperalgesia by sensitizing skeletal muscle nociceptors and producing marked spinal dorsal horn neuron hyperexcitability; both of which are thought to be key components of LBP chronicity. This proposal will characterize post-HVLA-SM muscle spindle response based on intrafusal fiber classification, HVLA-SM thrust duration (2-3ms vs 100ms), and HVLA-SM peak biomechanical forces reaching deep spinal tissues (multifidus muscle) in control and trunk chemosensitized (NGF-induced LBP) environments in order to reveal neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spinal manipulation and to establish another preclinical NGF-induced LBP model so as to better inform and/or optimize this non-pharmacological approach to LBP.","Project Narrative
Low back pain (LBP) is associated with more global disability than any other health condition and it exerts a major economic impact in the United States with total costs exceeding 100 billion per year. Spinal manipulation (SM) is recommended by clinical guidelines to treat LBP, however efficacy, utilization and therapeutic optimization is hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding underlying physiological mechanisms. This proposal seeks to characterize changes in post-SM muscle spindle afferent response using extremely short (2-3ms) and longer (100ms) manipulative thrusts in control and chemosensitized LBP environments using a preclinical model.",2019,216779,156000,60779,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCH ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS,352940001,Back Pain; Chronic Pain; Complementary and Integrative Health; Neurosciences; Pain Research,William Ray Reed
5K01MH115272-02,7T functional MRS of metabolite variations during working memory in subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application is a comprehensive training plan to
provide the candidate with additional and advanced skills needed to establish an independent program of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research using neuroimaging methods. The candidateâ€™s prior training in
neuroimaging has allowed her to hone many skills necessary to achieve this goal. However, she requires
additional training and experience in the following areas: (1) didactic and research training in PTSD; (2)
advanced techniques in high-field (7T) MR spectroscopy (MRS), specifically functional MRS (fMRS); (3)
programming skills for neuroimaging analyses; and (4) writing and professional development. The proposed
study will investigate the neurometabolic and functional correlates of cognitive deficits in PTSD. People with
PTSD commonly report difficulties with concentration, attention, and memory in addition to the core symptoms
of intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal. These cognitive symptoms can be especially distressing
and lead to poor social and occupational function and poor quality of life. Neuropsychological testing indicates
that working memory (WM) is one cognitive process affected in PTSD, yet the neural basis of WM dysfunction
is not well understood. Understanding the nature of these deficits is important not only because WM is crucial
for everyday functioning but also because WM facilitates common treatment strategies, such as cognitive
behavioral therapy. Converging evidence points to glutamatergic dysfunction in key brain regions in PTSD.
These abnormalities could underlie the differential activation patterns observed with functional imaging when
people with PTSD perform WM tasks; however, this has not been directly tested. Magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) has demonstrated great promise in closing this gap with recent in vivo studies of PTSD
showing disruptions of glutamate levels. However, none of these studies have correlated these in vivo
metabolic measurements with neural activation. Functional MRS (fMRS) can potentially address this issue by
measuring neurometabolic changes induced by neural activity in response to stimuli. Unlike traditional MRS,
which acquires data during the resting state, fMRS acquires data while participants are engaged in performing
a task, thereby providing a dynamic rather than static profile of neurometabolites. In this application, we
propose to develop fMRS techniques at 7T to explore the neural mechanisms that contribute to WM deficits in
PTSD. This research will combine traditional (static) MRS, functional MRI (fMRI), and advanced dynamic fMRS
to investigate the relationship between neural activation during WM and the underlying neurochemistry in
PTSD. Since fMRS and fMRI probe different aspects of neuronal firing and synaptic activity, the combined
approach of these techniques could better characterize the neurobiology underlying WM deficits in PTSD. If
successful, these methods could potentially be used to test the effects of current treatments and identify
potential targets for the development of novel medications to improve outcomes for people with PTSD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The goal of this research proposal is to investigate neurometabolic and functional correlates of working memory
deficits in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (fMRS). Findings from this project will contribute to a more complete understanding of working
memory and how it is affected in people with PTSD and could lead to more effective neuroimaging biomarkers
for assessing the effects of current and novel treatment strategies.",2019,160351,148567,11784,Other Research-Related,K01,National Institute of Mental Health,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,368325888,Anxiety Disorders; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Mind and Body; Neurosciences; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Violence Research,Meredith A Reid
5K01DK106341-05,Abnormal STAT3 signaling and aberrant O-glycosylation of IgA1 in IgA nephropathy,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal for the K01 Career Development Award from the NIDDK is to enhance the learning and research skills of the applicant in order to transition into an independent investigator. The career development aspect of this award is facilitated by his mentoring team, relevant courses, journal clubs, seminars, university centers, and cores dedicated to enhancing collaboration between clinicians and researchers. The research portion of this proposal is focused on the autoimmune disease IgA nephropathy (IgAN), which causes progressive kidney damage, and the mechanisms of autoantigen production. Identification of mechanisms involved in autoantigen production will allow for disease-specific therapies to be developed, which is absent in current therapeutic modalities. This has a huge cost burden on IgAN patients, both in terms of money and quality of life.  The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator, and as a current postdoc this will require more training and experience. This will be accomplished through collaboration with mentors who have extensive experience in molecular biology research, and specifically IgAN and kidney related diseases. The university has exceptional core programs set up to help young investigators with finding and writing grants, obtaining proper collaborative expertise, research training programs, and lab management courses.  IgAN is an autoimmune disease, which leads to decreased kidney function, with 40-50% of patients requiring dialysis and/or transplantation. In this autoimmune disease, B cells from the immune system produce IgA1 that has an aberrant glycosylation (termed Gd-IgA1) that causes the body to recognize IgA1 as a foreign antigen. The autoantigen, Gd-IgA1, is elevated in IgAN patients and forms the basis for immune-complex formation, which deposits in the kidney, leading to progressive kidney damage. The aims of this proposal are to identify mechanisms responsible for elevated Gd-IgA1 production in patient B cells. Identification of specific glycosylation enzymes that are differentially regulated and over activation signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by cytokines in IgAN patient B cells has provided us with a strong starting point. We propose to investigate mechanisms responsible for altered signaling in IgAN patients, thereby providing bases for future drug development to reduce autoantigen production.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is an autoimmune disease, where an individual's immune system attacks the kidney, causing slow kidney damage over time.

1R03DK122194-01,Abnormal cytokine response and autoantigen production in IgA-producing subpopulations in IgA nephropathy,"Abstract
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis. It leads to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD) in 40-50% of patients. IgAN patients often exhibit macroscopic hematuria, commonly associated with
upper-respiratory tract infections. This exacerbation of kidney injury seen during episodes of mucosal infection
and inflammation suggests a connection between the two. In biopsies of IgAN patients, the defining
characteristic of this disease is the deposits of polymeric IgA1, typically with IgG and complement C3 co-
deposits. Analysis of the deposited IgA1 revealed enrichment for galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) compared
to circulatory IgA1. In addition, the co-deposited IgG is specific for Gd-IgA1. This appears to be immune
complex deposition, which is also found in circulation of patients. Serum levels of Gd-IgA1 and anti-Gd-IgA1-
IgG autoantibodies are elevated in IgAN patients, associate with disease progression, and can be found
complexed in circulation. This circulatory autoantigen (Gd-IgA1) is typically found in the polymeric form, which
is unique to the mucosal region. This suggests that a subset of IgA1-producing cells could be migrating from
mucosal regions, or there is abnormal IgA1-producing cells formed elsewhere. Initial observations that mucosal
infections associated with transient hematuria in IgAN patients led to the thesis that pro-inflammatory
stimulation could increase circulatory Gd-IgA1-containing immune complexes, causing renal injury. We
recently published that IL-6 stimulation in EBV-immortalized IgA1-producing cells from IgAN patients, but not
controls, preferentially increased Gd-IgA1 production due to an enhanced and prolonged STAT3 activation. In
addition, preliminary data in our lab from single-cell transcriptome profiling using immortalized IgA-producing
cells from IgAN patients and healthy controls revealed multiple populations of IgA1-producing cells that have
differential responses to cytokine stimulation. These observations led to our hypothesis that enhanced Gd-
IgA1 production is a result of abnormal cytokine response in a subset of IgA1-producing cells. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that cytokine exposure has differential effects on subsets of IgA1-producing cells in
EBV- immortalized IgA1-producing cells from IgAN patients vs. healthy and disease controls. In Aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that subsets of IgA1-producing cells that have differential responses to cytokine stimulation
are preferentially producing Gd-IgA1. The combination of these two aims will help identify the specific IgA1-
producing cell subsets that contribute to autoantigen production. These studies will enable testing of novel
research hypotheses and yield new preliminary data towards a competitive R01 proposal.","Project Narrative/Relevance:
The goals of this proposal is to identify subpopulations of IgA1 producing cells from IgA
nephropathy patients and their abnormal responses to cytokine exposure that are responsible
for autoantigen production. Success of this endeavor will provide insight into mechanisms that
give rise to enhanced autoantigen production from B cells in IgA nephropathy patients which
will aid in the development of novel therapeutics.",2019,111375,75000,36375,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Kidney Disease; Rare Diseases,Colin Robert Reily
7R01HL136423-03,Epigenetic and Transcriptional Regulation of Angiogenic Regulator CD36 and Transformation of Capillaries into Small Arteries,"Project Summary
Arteriolar differentiation and formation of small arteries from very tiny blood vessels (capillary arterialization)
are fundamental processes underlying ischemic organ recovery from a noxious insult. Despite its obvious
clinical and biological importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of these events and their
regulation. We have recently discovered that transcriptional repression of CD36 is involved in a proangiogenic
and proarteriogenic reprogramming of capillary endothelial cells (EC) or microvascular EC (MVECs), and is
implicated in capillary arterialization. Specifically, we have shown that LPA/PKD-1 signaling-mediated CD36
transcriptional repression plays a key role in promoting arteriogenic gene expression in MVECs, and
microvascular remodeling in vivo. Moreover, EC-specific deletion of pkd-1 showed impaired recovery from
ischemic insult. These unexpected findings led to the hypothesis that CD36 gene repression via LPA/PKD-1
signaling axis reprograms MVECs to differentiate into arteriolar ECs and promotes capillary arterialization. To
test this hypothesis, we have established two- and three-dimensional MVEC culture systems, and in vivo
Matrigel assays. More importantly, we have established hindlimb ischemia models in unique cd36 gene
deficient mice with the EC-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), and EC-specific pkd-1
deficient mice or EC-specific pkd-1 deficient TRAP mice. These novel TRAP transgenic lines have targeted
gene deficiency and carry an EC-specific EGFP-tag that allows us to directly purify ribosome-bound mRNA
from ECs in vivo for next generation RNA-sequencing, facilitating probes of EC-specific transcriptome and
ribosome binding of noncoding RNAs. The availability of this mouse model provides us for the first time with
the ability to devise experiments to gain new and fundamental insights into biology of adult arteriolar growth
under ischemic conditions. Using these tools,, we aim to 1) prove that in MVECs the LPA/PKD-1-CD36
signaling axis is essential to regulate MVEC reprogramming and arteriolar differentiation; 2) test the hypothesis
that CD36 transcriptional repression via the LPA/PKD-1-FoxO1 signaling axis is a critical component of a
genetic reprogramming switch to promote capillary arterialization (de novo arteriogenesis). Together with
assays using a series of molecular biology and imaging methods single cell RNA-sequencing as well as
zebrafish models, we expect to accomplish these aims and provide a comprehensive evaluation of arteriolar
differentiation and capillary arterialization. This will illuminate poorly explored and poorly understood aspects of
vascular biology. This proposal focuses on de novo arteriogenesis in adult because of its remarkably practical
significance. Getting a greater understanding of capillary arterialization in adult tissues will provide important
insights into finding novel and effective therapeutic targets against ischemic heart and vascular diseases.","Project Narrative

5R01GM098539-08,Analytical tools for the analysis of clustered O-glycans in clinical samples,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins; over half of mammalian proteins are glycosylated. Patients with several autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some infectious diseases exhibit abnormal glycosylation of serum immunoglobulins and other glycoproteins. The biological functions of these modifications in health and disease continue to be a significant area of interest in biomedical research. Specifically, the task of defining site-specific glycoprotein heterogeneity is recognized as an area that still needs a considerable amount of effort to fully understand the role of glycan heterogeneity. We have developed robust workflows for the analysis of the IgA1 clustered O-glycan heterogeneity in clinical samples from patients with a chronic kidney disease, IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most predominant form of glomerulonephritis in the world. Our outcome-based approach for profiling the entire range of IgA1 O-glycoforms from clinical samples has made significant contributions to the field of IgAN research, but also to the broader field of profiling protein glycosylation heterogeneity. Our findings have provided a means of detecting shifts in glycan heterogeneity through the application of relative quantitative, label-free analysis of the entire population of IgA1 glycofors in a single serum sample. Based on our novel workflows, we have identified subsets of IgA1 O-glycoforms in patients with IgAN that are significantly increased/decreased in their relative abundance compared to healthy controls. Going forward, absolute quantitation of individual O-glycoforms is needed. There are no established methods for the quantitative analysis of intact clustered O-glycopeptides or O-glycoproteins with Core 1 type O-glycans. Current quantitative immunoassays for detection of aberrant Core 1 glycans (Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens) are not well defined in terms of what protein, amino acid, or adjacent O-glycan context they recognize. In this proposal, we will adapt our existing methods for relative quantitative profiles into absolute quantitative strategies with O-glycopeptide reference standards. We hypothesize that this approach will provide a needed tool for heavily O-glycosylated proteins to become reliable clinical biomarkers. We have successfully synthesized in-house a series of complex clustered O-glycopeptides to serve as reference standards and novel reagents for the analysis of clustered O-glycan-specific epitopes. We will apply our quantitative strategies to the analysis of two IgAN patient cohorts to identify specific Tn antigen-presenting IgA1 O-glycoforms that lead to the formation of nephritogenic immune complexes. We will also make use of our accumulated knowledge of clustered O-glycan heterogeneity in tandem repeat amino acid sequences to characterize the accessible Tn antigen epitopes for recognition by naturally occurring and commercially available antibodies.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to continue to develop analytical tools for the analysis of glycoproteins with clustered O-glycans in clinical samples.

1F31DK120064-01,The Primary Cilium as a Novel Regulator of the Immune Response in the Kidney,"Project Abstract:
Primary cilia are small microtubule-based appendages expressed on nearly every cell type. Genetic
mutations that affect the construction or function of the cilium result in a spectrum of disorders termed
ciliopathies, which manifest in a range of phenotypes including neural defects, skeletal defects, situs
inversus, and renal, hepatic, and pancreatic cysts. The most common ciliopathy, Polycystic Kidney Disease
(PKD), affects more than 13 million individuals worldwide and is characterized by the formation of large renal
and hepatic cysts. Despite decades of research, treatment of PKD in the U.S remains limited to dialysis and
kidney transplants, necessitating more research into the disease. Recently, it has emerged that
macrophages and the inflammatory response promote PKD progression, raising the possibility that renal
primary cilia may regulate the innate immune response. Our study aims to determine how mutations to the
primary cilium affect kidney function and the local immune response to promote cyst formation. To study the
effects of ciliary dysfunction, we utilize mice with conditional alleles for polycystin-2 (PC2), a cationic channel
mutated in human PKD, as well as IFT88, a protein necessary for cilium biogenesis and homeostasis.
Previous work has demonstrated that deletion of either of these genes prior to postnatal day 12 (P12) in mice
induces rapid cyst formation, while deletion after P14 results in slow, focal cyst formation that takes several
months to form. This has gone on to suggest the presence of a â€œcritical windowâ€ in which functional primary
cilia are necessary for proper kidney function. Interestingly, rapid cyst formation is restored to adult induced
mice following renal injury. Our lab has recently shown that specific subpopulations of macrophages are
present in the juvenile kidney and that this macrophage profile shifts around the critical window. Moreover,
the juvenile profile returns to the adult induced kidney following injury, suggesting that this subpopulation
associates with rapid cyst formation and may promote cyst growth. These data lead to our overall hypothesis
that disruption of cilia structure or function leads to a dysregulated intercellular signaling microenvironment
and inflammatory response, which drives cyst formation and disease progression. We intend to test this
hypothesis through utilization of novel intravital microscopy techniques. Aim 1 will determine how
dysfunctional primary cilia affect the repair processes following injury in the kidney through the use of mice
with fluorescently labeled primary cilia (sstr3GFP) and through the use of dextran injection that will label
actively filtrating nephrons. Aim 2 will elucidate the effects of ciliary mutations on macrophage profile and
their intercellular actions following kidney injury. This will be accomplished by injuring transgenic mice with
fluorescently labeled macrophages (Ccr2RFP;Cx3cr1GFP), while using dextran injection to label active tubules.
Data gathered from this research will be beneficial in determining how mutations to the cilium exert global
effects in the kidney to influence renal function, macrophage accumulation, inflammation, and cyst formation.","Project Narrative:
Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a common genetic disorder that affects more than 13 million people
worldwide and leads to end stage renal disease in 50% of those affected. Despite clinical need, the
mechanisms of PKD remain incompletely understood and the only treatments available are dialysis and
organ transplant. Data generated from this work will help address how cells of the immune system are
dysregulated in PKD and how they are promoting cyst growth and disease, thus providing possible targets
for therapeutic treatments.",2019,36031,36031,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Kidney Disease; Pediatric; Polycystic Kidney Disease,Dustin Z Revell

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a training plan to develop Lindsay A. Rhodes, MD into an independent clinician- scientist specializing in health services research, including novel care delivery models such as telemedicine. Dr. Rhodes is a board certified ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in glaucoma and with prior research experience in telemedicine. This training program will consist of mentored research, advanced coursework leading to a Master of Science in Public Health in Outcomes Research, and multi-disciplinary conferences. Mentored research will be conducted under the direction of a mentoring team composed of Dr. Christopher Girkin, Professor and Chairman of the UAB Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Cynthia Owsley, Professor and Vice Chair for Clinical Research at the UAB Department of Ophthalmology, Dr. Stephen Mennemeyer, Professor in the UAB Department of Health Care Organization and Policy, and Dr. Gerald McGwin, Professor and Vice Chair in the UAB Department of Epidemiology. The proposed mentored research plan will evaluate a novel community-based care delivery model for open angle glaucoma. The overarching hypothesis is that a telemedicine-based detection and management program using a comprehensive remote optic nerve assessment (CRONA) performed in community clinics and then transmitted to a remote reading center can access at-risk minority populations as accurately as standard in-person care by a glaucoma specialist, at lower cost, and with a platform for eye health education designed to improve patient adherence to filling glaucoma medications. This hypothesis will be tested utilizing data obtained from a recently developed telemedicine demonstration program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, entitled Eye Care Quality and Accessibility Improvement in the Community (EQUALITY), along with a smaller cross-sectional study. EQUALITY deployed an integrated telemedicine program within two primary eye care clinics (Walmart Vision Centers) located within retail centers that serve predominantly African American communities in underserved areas of Alabama. Primary eye care providers in these retail-based clinics performed dilated comprehensive eye exams with the additional use of automated optic nerve structural and functional assessment to assist in the detection of glaucoma.

1U01DP006441-01,Using Telemedicine to Prevent Blindness in an At-Risk Rural Alabama Population,"Project Summary
The number of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) cases will increase by 250% by
2050, directly affecting over 7 million lives. These numbers are specifically for POAG
and do not include the many who are monitored and treated for elevated intraocular
pressure or for glaucoma suspect status, which along with POAG can all be considered
glaucoma associated diseases (GAD). Development of high-quality, accessible, and
cost-effective strategies for eye care for these individuals is of critical importance.
POAG is at least 4-5 times higher in African Americans, progresses more rapidly and
appears about 10 years earlier as compared to those of European descent. This
research plan seeks to implement and evaluate a telemedicine-based detection and
management strategy for GAD and other eye diseases in patients seen at Federally
Qualified Health Centers (FQHCâ€™s) located in the rural Alabama Black Belt Region. This
region is characterized by one of the highest concentrations of African Americans in the
US; high poverty, unemployment, and uninsured rates; inadequate educational
systems, transportation and community resources; few optometrists who largely
practice in retail settings; and no ophthalmologists specializing in glaucoma. We have
developed and tested a novel multimodal telemedicine approach in our prior CDC-
funded Eye Care Quality and Accessibility Improvement in the Community (EQUALITY)
study that used comprehensive remote optic nerve assessment (RONA). This proposal
will employ a modification of the EQUALITY approach using portable measurement of
visual function and optic nerve and retinal structure that are more applicable to rural
locations with limited resources. We will also identify and evaluate remediation
strategies for the barriers to patient adherence with referral and follow-up appointments
by comparing the effectiveness of financial incentives along with a validated patient
education program versus a validated patient education program alone. Using this
program within FQHCâ€™s will enable expansion nationwide into rural and urban
underserved locations as these centers provide primary health care services in
underserved areas and treat more than 27 million people yearly at over 12,000 sites.","Project Narrative

5P01HL066299-17,Cyclic nucleotide gradients regulate the balance of mechanical forces underlying pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) form contiguous, semi-permeable barriers between the
bloodstream and the interstitial space. cAMP generated by plasma membrane-localized adenylyl cyclases
(ACs) enhances PMVEC barriers. In contrast, cytosolic cAMP, cGMP, and cUMP generated by exogenous and
endogenous soluble cyclases disrupt PMVEC barriers. These observations suggest that cyclic nucleotide
signals are highly localized, or compartmentalized, and that near-membrane and cytosolic cAMP, cGMP, and
perhaps cUMP signals have opposing effects on endothelial function in the lung microvasculature. The concept
of compartmentalized signals implies that feedback networks localized to specific subcellular domains control
the kinetics of second messenger signals. However, our understanding of the physiological and
pathophysiological implications of localized feedback networks within pulmonary endothelial cells is at best
rudimentary. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to determine the spatial and temporal relationships
between compartmentalized cAMP signals, PKA-mediated feedback networks, and regulation of mechanical
forces in pulmonary endothelial cells. Experiments described in this proposal will for the first time identify
where cAMP signals occur in the 3D space of PMVECs, identify important temporal components of cAMP
signals, and chart feedback mechanisms contributing to signal localization and kinetics of these signals. In
other words, we will provide roadmaps identifying the spatial locations of cAMP signals that are critical for
controlling the dynamics of cellular forces. We will then overlay these responses onto PKA activity maps and
underlying distributions of A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). As such, successful completion of the studies
proposed in this application will identify the spatial and temporal fingerprints of specific cAMP signalosomes
that regulate mechanical forces within pulmonary endothelial cells, and thus control endothelial barrier integrity.
The spatial and temporal fingerprints will direct future studies aimed at identifying target proteins within these
signalosomes, leading to both a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying localized signal
transduction and identifying translational targets within signalosomes.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01HL141473-02,Regulation of phosphodiesterases and cAMP signaling during the host-pathogen interaction in the pulmonary endothelium,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory lung disease associated with high
morbidity/mortality and limited treatment options. A breakdown of pulmonary endothelial barrier function,
leading to edema and impaired lung function, is a hallmark of ARDS. It is well established that stimulation of
cAMP synthesis, such as with Î²-adrenoceptor agonists, enhances endothelial barrier function and is protective
in preclinical models of sterile lung injury such as upon LPS administration. However, clinical trials probing the
utility of Î²-agonists in ARDS have failed and the reasons remain unclear. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the enzymes that degrade and inactivate cAMP, play a critical role in the
regulation of cellular cAMP levels, the subcellular compartmentalization of these signals, and hence endothelial
cell functions. Our preliminary data indicate that a single Type-4 PDE isoform, PDE4D, contributes the
predominant portion of cAMP-hydrolytic capacity in the pulmonary endothelium and is tightly regulated under
physiologic conditions. P.aeruginosa (PA) is a common cause of nosocomial pneumonia that can progress to
sepsis and ARDS. We observed that during the host-pathogen interaction, distinct PA virulence factors induce
PDE4D activation, resulting in a suppression and dysregulation of endothelial cAMP signals. Specifically, the
bacterial exotoxin cyclase ExoY promotes a PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D that
alters endothelial cAMP signaling. In addition, PA infection can induce a PKA-independent, but type-3
secretion system- and flagellin-dependent PDE4D regulation that results in activation and subcellular
relocalization of the enzyme. With this proposal, we will define the pathways by which PA virulence factors
alter PDE4D functions and its contribution to endothelial barrier disruption and lung injury. We will test the idea
that PA-induced PDE4D activation correlates with health outcomes in patients with PA-associated ARDS, and
that, conversely, inhibition of PDE4 is endothelial barrier protective. We will test the idea that aberrant PDE4
activation limits the therapeutic efficacy of Î²-agonists in settings of PA-lung infection as well as other causes of
ARDS. The PDE4 family comprises four genes and non-selective PDE4 inhibitors have established therapeutic
effects in preclinical models of ARDS, but also induce side effects, such as emesis and nausea, that limit their
clinical utility. Given the unique and non-overlapping physiological and pathophysiological roles of each PDE4
isoform, targeting individual PDE4 proteins can serve to dissect the therapeutically beneficial from the side
effects of the PAN-PDE4 inhibitors available to date. To this end, we will determine whether selective ablation
of PDE4D is protective in ex vivo and in vivo models of PA-lung injury, paving the way for development of
PDE4D-selective inhibitors as ARDS therapeutics with an improved safety profile compared to the non-
selective PDE4 inhibitors available to date.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R56AG061785-01,Circadian changes in network excitability and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Converging evidence indicates that neuronal and network hyperexcitability is an important early event in
Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The cellular and molecular basis of this hyperexcitability is a critical area of
investigation and the presence of similar hyperexcitability in animal models enables studies to dissect
underlying mechanisms. A key insight is that hyperexcitability in both AD patients and mouse models has a
strong diurnal rhythm. Emerging data from both humans and animal models indicate that neural excitability in
the forebrain is under circadian control, altering seizure thresholds and epileptiform activity. Circadian variation
in cellular function is driven by transcriptional molecular clocks expressed in most cells, and molecular clock
ablation increases AD pathology. We have compelling preliminary evidence for rhythmic variation in neuronal
excitability that is at least partly due to circadian regulation of the membrane properties of inhibitory
interneurons, especially fast-spiking cells that express parvalbumin â€“ a cell type implicated in AD. Given that
molecular and physiological rhythms in hippocampus are disrupted in AD patients and AD mouse models, we
propose rigorous experiments to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of the molecular clock and resulting
changes in PV+ interneuron gene expression and activity contributes to AD-related neuronal hyperexcitability.
Specifically, we will evaluate the differences in circadian clock and clock-controlled gene expression in PV+
interneurons in a mouse model of AD, using a combination of RNA sequencing, state-of-the-art bioinformatics,
and recently developed tools to evaluate molecular clock rhythmicity and transcription in a cell-specific manner
(Aim 1). We will use patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine if AD-related impairment of the circadian clock
alters day-night differences in neurophysiological properties of PV+ interneurons, causing hyperexcitability
(Aim 2). Finally, we will utilize an innovative chemogenetic chronotherapeutic approach to manipulate PV+
interneuron physiology to determine whether reinstating the normal circadian regulation of PV+ interneuron
electrophysiological properties protects against AD-related hyperexcitability, cognitive impairment, and
pathology (Aim 3). The proposed studies led by a strong interdisciplinary team uses powerful approaches to
determine how disruption of circadian rhythms facilitates neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to early
stages of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may catalyze development of behavioral or pharmacologic
interventions.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R21MH117434-02,Mechanisms of copper dysregulation in schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating mental illness with genetic and environmental risk factors that affects
1% of the world population. Pathology exists in multiple grey and white matter areas and neurotransmitter
systems, making the search for a cause(s) and effective treatment elusive. Exploring new pathological
mechanisms is paramount in trying to advance our understanding of SZ. Copper, which is required for proper
monoamine metabolism, neurotransmission, mitochondrial activity, and myelination, is implicated in SZ but so
far not studied in the brain. There is substantial evidence that copper is increased in the blood of patients with
SZ. Interestingly, experimental manipulations that decrease copper produce demyelination, increases in
dopamine, and behavioral impairments reminiscent of some SZ symptoms. Dysbindin is an upstream modulator
of copper via the dysbindin/BLOC-1-copper metabolism interactome. It is encoded by the gene DTNBP1, which
is a top candidate gene for SZ. A consequence of dysfunctional dysbindin in mice is a decrease in the copper
transporters ATP7A and CTR1, which facilitate copper transport between the blood and the brain. To date, in
spite of compelling evidence for a role of dysbindin in SZ, no one has linked a decrease in dysbindin function
with abnormal copper homoeostasis in SZ. My overall hypothesis is that copper homeostatic and transport
system alterations contribute to SZ pathology, potentially through decreased dysbindin expression. In support of
this, we have observed decreased ATP7A and CTR1 protein in postmortem SZ substantia nigra (SN). SA1) In
postmortem brain, we will test the hypothesis that SZ cases have lower levels of brain copper, ATP7A and/or
CTR1, and dysbindin. We will study the SN and hippocampus, because these areas are implicated in SZ and
have decreased dysbindin levels. We will use western blot protein analyses, quantitative immunohistochemistry
to localize copper transporters, copper and dysbindin. SA2) In SZ patients and controls, we will test the
hypothesis that medication naÃ¯ve subjects with SZ at first psychotic break will show markers of decreased
dysbindin function, lower levels of ATP7A and/or CTR1, and higher levels of copper in blood or saliva. To do this
we will get saliva/and or blood from SZ subjects in two different first episode clinics before and after treatment,
and healthy controls. SA3) In an animal model with a knockout of the dysbindin gene, we will test the hypothesis
that rescue of impairments in behaviors relevant to SZ, via antipsychotic drugs (APD), will require an increase
in ATP7A and/or CTR1. We will treat dysbindin KO, heterozygotes and WT littermates with APDs, test behavior
before and after treatment, then analyze the brain for levels of copper, ATP7A and CTR1. These studies will
provide the first evidence of the state of copper in SZ brain. Although no one single abnormality will be the cause
or cure of SZ, our studies will provide new data about the effects of copper transporters (a previously unstudied
pathway in SZ), the role of dysbindin and its and a potential mechanism of antipsychotic rescue of copper
starvation deficits, which could yield novel targets for drug development.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1K01HL147998-01,Racial Differences in Serum Sodium and Blood Pressure Regulation,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
CANDIDATE: Austin T. Robinson, Ph.D is a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Delaware (UD). Dr.
Robinson aims to study racial differences in cardiovascular responses to high dietary sodium (Na+). He recently
published data demonstrating that compared to white individuals, 1) black individuals have augmented increases
in serum Na+ to a hypertonic saline infusion; and 2) exhibit higher blood pressure (BP) for a given serum Na+. In
this proposal, he will translate these findings by comprehensively assessing neurovascular responses to acute
(single meal) and chronic (10 days of a controlled feeding) high dietary Na+. The central hypothesis is that high
dietary Na+ influences sympathetic nerve activity similarly in black and white individuals; however, diminished
vasodilator capacity and augmented sympathetic transduction (vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve
bursts) contribute to exaggerated BP dysregulation in black individuals. He will also determine the role of lifestyle
factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline racial differences in CV physiology.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Robinson proposes to enhance his career development by: 1) Acquiring
new skills in the assessment of sleep, assessment of (nitric oxide) NO. bioavailability, and assessment of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). 2) Advanced training in epidemiology to analyze large data sets. Specifically, he will
perform secondary data of samples collected for the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) under the
guidance of advisor Dr. Norrina Allen, an expert epidemiologist. 3) Refining his professional skills though formal
course work, attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs, and at national/international scientific
meetings. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Robinson will train in an outstanding research environment supported by a multi-
disciplinary team of mentors. The primary mentor, Dr. Farquhar, is an NHLBI-funded full professor at UD with a
record of successful mentorship. He is an expert in autonomic control of circulation, and executing controlled
salt feeding studies. Co-mentor Dr. Edwards is also at UD and a leading expert in vascular physiology function
and executing controlled dietary salt feeding studies. Co-mentor Dr. Brown is an expert in lifestyle as a preventive
and treatment strategy for hypertension and vascular function in black individuals. Advisors Dr. Zimmerman and
Dr. Poole are experts in ROS and NO. signaling, respectively. Advisor Dr. Buxton is a recognized expert in sleep
and health consequences of sleep deficiency, especially cardiometabolic outcomes. Advisor Dr. Wright is a
professor in Nursing at UD and has expertise in neuropsychology and racial disparities. RESEARCH: Black
individuals are more prone to salt-sensitive elevations in BP and adverse cardiovascular conditions associated
with chronic high dietary Na+ intake compared to other racial groups. Racial disparities in vascular function and,
autonomic control of BP in black individuals under basal conditions also exist. There is a critical need to elucidate
the physiology underlying these racial disparities and to determine if these racial disparities are attributable to
lifestyle differences.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Nearly nine in ten Americans overconsume salt, and black individuals are more prone to salt-sensitive
hypertension and experience the adverse cardiovascular comorbidities associated with high dietary salt. We
seek to test the hypothesis that acute (single meal) and chronic (10-day controlled feeding) high dietary salt
leads to a greater impairment in conduit artery function and augmented sympathetic transduction, leading to
exaggerated blood pressure dysregulation in black, compared to white, individuals. Importantly, we also seek to
determine if lifestyle factors (sleep, habitual physical activity, diet, and mental health) modulate racial disparities
in cardiovascular function at baseline and in response to acute and chronic high dietary salt interventions.",2019,131835,122069,9766,Other Research-Related,K01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION,368325888,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Hypertension; Nutrition; Sleep Research,Austin Tyler Robinson
5R03HD093942-02,Assessing Parent-Child Aggression Risk Among Physical Child Abuse Perpetrators,"ABSTRACT
Alarming child abuse statistics highlight that parent-child aggression (PCA) remains widespread in this country,
adversely impacting the short-term and long-term emotional and physical welfare of children and incurring
substantial costs to society. To avoid such detrimental outcomes, efforts to avert physical child abuse must
identify and tackle the key factors that culminate in PCA. Although research has implicated a number of
potential risk factors for PCA, major obstacles impede our progress. Heavy reliance on self-report
questionnaires to measure constructs related to PCA can be biased, which confound our ability to conclusively
identify the potential mechanisms that exacerbate risk for PCA. Most researchers also typically question
parents about potential PCA risk factors while not in the act of parenting, asking them to summarize their
experiences and beliefs about parenting, which may not accurately reflect actual parenting behavior or
cognitions. To determine if a factor contributes to PCA and actual parenting behavior, we must be confident in
how the factor was measured. Risk factors should also be theoretically grounded although often such factors
are studied in isolation or inadequately integrated into a cohesive model. Thus, the current project will explore
the feasibility of conducting an innovative, multi-method assessment of PCA risk in a group of 100 mothers
who have substantiated cases of physical child abuse. Factors investigated in this assessment will reflect
components of Social Information Processing (SIP) theory, a theoretical model that focuses on cognitive
processes parents may experience that increase their abuse risk, although the model has not yet been
comprehensively applied to abusive parents. In recent efforts to refine the SIP model, a more inclusive
theoretical model will be considered in this study, with emotion, personal vulnerabilities, and resiliencies
integrated with the SIP sociocognitive processes. This study will evaluate a selection of analog tasksâ€”indirect
assessment methods that utilize behavioral simulations or implicit means to assess a constructâ€”with mothers
substantiated for physical abuse. Analog tasks will be compared to traditional self-report approaches as well as
more proximal parenting behavior and cognitions assessed via experience sampling methods (ESM). We
capitalize on technological advances by using ESM with smartphones to assess daily parenting across four
weeks. Findings will be relevant for both research and clinical purposes. Improved detection of particular
elements of the theoretical model offer potential targets for prevention and intervention programs. Moreover,
results from this project will provide initial insights into the feasibility of alternative methodologies to assess
critical constructs related to PCA risk. With this initial project, subsequent research can then contrast
substantiated perpetrators with comparison groups of varying risk status to determine the discriminant validity
of analog tasks and later, whether such tools could ultimately be adapted to create computerized intervention
and prevention strategies.","NARRATIVE
Research has investigated potential factors that may heighten the risk of a parent engaging in physical child
abuse--a major public health concern--but progress in the field remains compromised by methodological
limitations. The current project will apply a strong theoretical model of risk factors using an innovative,

could help us enhance future research designs as well as inform clinical strategies applicable for at-risk
families.",2019,79520,53549,25971,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Child Abuse and Neglect Research; Clinical Research; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Injury - Childhood Injuries; Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention; Violence Research,CHRISTINA Maria RODRIGUEZ
1R56EB027120-01A1,Optical Mapping of Electromechanics of the Stomach,"The stomach is an electromechanical organ whose contractions are coordinated by an electrical wave
called the slow wave. This activity is traditionally studied at low spatial resolution by recording from sparse
electrodes either in contact with the organ or on the body surface. Recently, a few groups have mapped slow
wave propagation with much higher spatial resolution by placing arrays of dozens of electrodes on the stom-
achâ€™s surface. These studies are revealing the details of normal slow wave propagation as well as dysrhythmic
patterns that occur in disease states. However, there is little information on how normal and abnormal slow
waves relate to detailed spatial patterns of muscle contraction. Improved understanding is needed to improve
diagnosis and treatment of debilitating gastric motility disorders that are underdiagnosed and understudied.
 To this end, this Bioengineering Research Grant will develop novel research instrumentation to simultane-
ously record from the stomach: (1) spatiotemporal patterns of electrical activation and recovery and (2) spatio-
temporal patterns of muscle contraction. The methods will be used as research tools in animal experiments.
 Aim 1. Develop a system to image the membrane potential (Vm) of smooth muscle cells on the stomachâ€™s
surface. In an in vivo swine model, the stomach will be exposed and stained with a fluorescent dye whose re-
sponse is modulated by Vm. Small fiducial markers will be attached to the serosal surface. Fluorescence emis-
sion will be imaged with a video camera. By tracking the motion of the fiducial markers and alternating the
wavelength of excitation light delivered with each camera frame, motion artifact caused by stomach contraction
will be suppressed. These data will enable us to track slow waves as they propagate across the stomach.
 Aim 2: Develop an optical system to image the mechanical contraction that results from slow wave propa-
gation. Additional video camera(s) mounted in a binocular fashion will be used to track the motion of the fidu-
cial markers in three dimensions. From this, the deformation of the stomachâ€™s surface will be quantified in
terms of finite strain. These data will be temporally synchronized with the Vm data. These data will enable de-
tailed study of the interactions between electrical and mechanical function in the stomach.
 Aim 3: Perform combined electromechanical mapping studies in normal preparations and preparations in
which abnormal slow wave propagation patterns (dysrhythmias) are induced pharmacologically. Gastric empty-
ing of liquid test meals will be compared with electromechanical mapping data during normal and dysrhythmic
slow wave propagation.
 The project is a collaboration between the PI, who is an expert in developing and applying novel optical
mapping methods for the heart, and Auckland-based investigators, who are experts in gastrointestinal physiol-
ogy and mapping. We expect that success of this project will lead to future collaborations applying the new
technology to problems in physiology and medicine.","Narrative

1R21HL140998-01A1,Optical Mapping of Cardiac Electromechanics in the In Vivo Setting,"Heart contraction is triggered by a wave of electrical depolarization that propagates through the
myocardium. Optical mapping is a fluorescence-based technology for tracking electrical waves as they move
through the heart. It is advantageous relative to electrode-based technology in that it images transmembrane
potential, rather than extracellular potential, and therefore provides information on electrical recovery, which is
a key factor in many dangerous arrhythmias. It also typically has higher spatial resolution than electrical
mapping and is not adversely affected by strong electrical stimuli. Because of these advantages, optical
mapping has become a mainstay of experimental cardiac electrophysiology research. However, traditional
optical mapping has a major disadvantage: because of artifacts caused by cardiac motion, it is typically used in
ex vivo hearts in which contraction is pharmacologically arrested. This has precluded its use clinically and in in
vivo animal preparations. It has also limited optical mappingâ€™s application to purely electrophysiological
questionsâ€”important questions in cardiology that involve the bidirectional electromechanical interactions in the
heart cannot be addressed when mechanical function has been abolished.
 Some of this limitation was recently removed by the introduction of a novel method that uses a combination
of motion tracking and multi-wavelength excitation to perform optical mapping in isolated beating hearts. This
method simultaneously tracks electrical propagation and quantifies deformation of the myocardium due to
contraction or loading. It can therefore be used for a new set of questions in cardiac physiology that cannot be
directly addressed with traditional optical mapping or other technologies. However, the method still has
limitations imposed by the ex vivo preparation, for example, the overly-simple mechanical loading conditions
applied to the heart; the effects of autonomic denervation; and the limited oxygen carrying capacity of
crystalloid solution, which may affect the heartâ€™s metabolic state.
 To address these limitations, this project will take the next step and implement in vivo optical mapping:
 Aim 1: Engineer an optical electromechanical mapping method for use in in vivo, open-chest, large animal
preparations. Epicardial motion tracking and excitation ratiometry are key components of the method.
 Aim 2: Validate the electromechanical measurements generated by the new method and characterize any
physiological side effects.
 Successful completion of these aims will result in a new tool for cardiology research. A few potential
applications include: preclinical evaluation of the mechanical efficacy and electrical safety of therapies for
ischemic heart disease; investigation of the effects of wall stretch on normal propagation and
arrhythmogenesis; investigation of the effects of mechanical loading conditions on electrical propagation; and
investigation of the effects of multi-site pacing protocols on regional wall motion.","Narrative
 The proposed project will develop a new research tool for quantifying the integrated electrical and

Core (SRC) is to provide all AMPLIFI projects with the expertise and infrastructure required for intervention
adaptation, optimizing future dissemination and implementation (D&I), and identifying processes common
across all interventions that advance adaptation and D&I science. Although multiple randomized controlled
trials have tested the efficacy of interventions aimed at improving health behaviors after a cancer diagnosis
and treatment, translation of these interventions into standard practice and broader use is limited. Such
translation could be improved by developing an integrated approach to intervention adaptation to different
settings, subgroups, and distance-delivery strategies while improving intervention D&I potential. Mixed
methods research approach is well-recognized as crucial to the adaptation process and provides the rich data
needed to better understand adaptation and D&I strategies. Hence, the ADI SRC includes a multidisciplinary
team with collective expertise in adaptation, D&I science, mixed methods research, cancer survivorship, older,
rural and minority populations, technology-supported health behavior interventions, and health disparities. In so
doing, the ADI SRC will support all AMPLIFI projects and fill an important scientific knowledge gap related to
the â€œtype 3 evidenceâ€ needed to better adapt and implement interventions. The ADI SRC specific aims are:
 Primary Aim: Support each project by developing and maintaining an infrastructure for providing
methodological guidance, expert consulting and trained staff to ensure that investigators have ready access to
relevant resources, mixed methods data, and logistical support for measuring D&I related outcomes,
completing intervention adaptations, evaluation, and refinements, and finalizing implementation toolkits.
 Secondary Aim 1: Assist project investigators in describing, categorizing, and tallying adaptations required
by each project (before and during implementation) to determine the most common adaptations needed for
different cancer groups, geographical locations, and distance delivery methods.
 Secondary Aim 2: Assist project investigators in optimizing intervention D&I after project completion. This
will include but is not limited to identifying similarities and differences across the project interventions to
optimize D&I after project completion (e.g., D&I barriers and facilitators, relevant stakeholders and community
partners, and potential strategies and venues for improving future D&I of the adapted interventions).
 Secondary Aim 3: Develop an adaptation model for guiding adaptations of health behavior interventions for
cancer survivors applicable across different health behaviors and types of distance-delivery methods.
The D&I outcomes data will be used to integrate recommendations for improving D&I potential into the model.
The ADI SRC's exceptional team of investigators and consultants will use a rigorous mixed methods approach

5P01CA229997-02,Project 2: Reaching Cancer Survivors with Distance-delivered Support for Physical Activity Behavior Change (REACH),"Reaching Cancer Survivors with Distance-delivered Support for Physical Activity Behavior Change
Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the U.S., resulting in over a half a million deaths each year.
Furthermore, cancer survivors are more likely to suffer from second cancers, medical comorbidities, and
reduced quality of life. Vulnerable cancer survivors (e.g., older, rural residents, underserved) bear a
disproportionate burden of suffering after a cancer diagnosis related to greater mortality and poorer health and
well-being. Exercise is an important aspect of survivorship care that can reduce this burden of suffering.
However, the majority of cancer survivors do not engage in regular exercise, and behavior change
interventions aimed at increasing exercise behavior often fall short of achieving the recommended exercise
amount of â‰¥ 150 weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise. Moreover, such interventions are
rarely tested for cost-effectiveness or translated into broader use. This proposal addresses this research gap
by adapting the BEAT Cancer intervention, proven to be efficacious in significantly improving the odds of
meeting exercise recommendations in cancer survivors, to web-based delivery that will increase its
dissemination and implementation (D&I) potential. Core intervention components (i.e., elements responsible for
intervention efficacy) identified during efficacy testing will also be adapted to improve acceptability among
diverse cancer survivors (e.g., older, rural residents, African-Americans). The adapted intervention will be
called Reaching out for Exercise Adherence to improve Cancer survivors' Health (REACH). The 6-month
REACH intervention will then be tested in 326 survivors of a variety of cancers and in whom significant
proportions will be older, rural, and minority. Investigators will employ a 2-arm randomized controlled design in
which survivors will be assigned with equal allocation to receive REACH or wait-list control. Our primary aim
will be to determine between-arm differences with regard to meeting current exercise recommendations (â‰¥ 150
weekly minutes of â‰¥ moderate intensity physical activity) measured by accelerometer. Our secondary aims will
include REACH's effects on self-reported physical activity and on anthropometrics (e.g., waist circumference),
lean body mass, physical function, quality of life, and biomarkers (i.e., telomerase [marker of successful aging],
IFNÎ³ [immune status], and high sensitivity CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 [systemic inflammation]). Intervention cost-
effectiveness will also be assessed. This proposal is critical to improving the D&I potential and public health
impact of the core intervention components identified in an efficacious exercise behavior change program for
cancer survivors. Increasing access to efficacious exercise behavior change interventions is critical to
addressing the significant mortality, comorbidity, and psychosocial burden experienced by millions of cancer
survivors each year.","PROJECT 2

1R01CA235598-01A1,Role of gut microbe composition in psychosocial symptom response to exercise training in breast cancer survivors,"Growing evidence supports the importance of the gut microbiota composition for health and well-being. Breast
cancer survivors are at increased risk for altered microbiota composition (dysbiosis) which may contribute to
cancer risk and symptoms such as fatigue. Animal models and human studies (including work by our
investigative team) have linked exercise with favorable changes in gut microbial diversity, an abundance of
select microbes, and production of beneficial metabolites. As such, exercise is a promising strategy for
reversing dysbiosis yet only one human study has used a randomized design, none have strictly controlled
diet, and none have enrolled cancer survivors. Determining exercise training effects on gut microbiota
composition in cancer survivors and potential mechanistic links between exercise, gut microbiota composition,
and fatigue can be applied to optimizing exercise benefits and developing new therapeutic applications. Doing
so in fatigued breast cancer survivors provides the opportunity to reduce a distressing symptom suffered by
many of the 3.1 million breast cancers survivors living in the U.S. Therefore, we propose a randomized
controlled trial among breast cancer survivors with fatigue and low cardiorespiratory fitness. Assessments will
occur at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 weeks. Our specific aims are as follows: Primary aim: Determine
effects of a progressive 12-week aerobic exercise training intervention (focused on improving cardiorespiratory
fitness [peak VO2]) compared to standard attention control on gut microbiota composition (primary outcome)
while standardizing diet across all participants with controlled feeding. Based on our preliminary work, we
hypothesize that compared to control, the aerobic exercise training group will demonstrate significant
differences in gut microbial diversity with increased Bacteroides (g), increased Firmicutes (p), and decreased
Actinomycetales (o) and Proteobacteria (p). Week 12 is our primary time point; week 6 will explore interim
changes and week 18 will explore durability of effects. Secondary aim: 1) Test if the aerobic exercise training
effect on gut microbiota composition is directly and/or indirectly mediated through inflammation (interleukin [IL]
â€“ 6, IL â€“ 10), autonomic nervous system (heart rate variability), or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol).
Given the dynamic brain-gut-microbiota axis, we will test mediation relationships by ordering our outcome
measures within the assessment period such that hypothesized mediators are assessed in the week prior to
the fecal collection. 2) Test if the aerobic exercise training effect on fatigue is directly and/or indirectly mediated
through changes in the gut microbiota composition. We will explore these mediation relationships within each
assessment time points by collecting the fecal sample prior to fatigue measurement. Determining exercise
effects on gut microbiota composition in cancer survivors holds the potential to identify targets for enhancing
exercise benefits while also providing foundational data for personalized exercise prescriptions based on gut
microbiota composition and gut microbiota composition manipulation for improved health.","Cancer survivors are at increased risk of gut bacteria communities that can negatively impact health and
energy level and it is possible that exercise can cause healthy changes in these communities. Through careful
design, this study will use a controlled-feeding diet and 12 weeks of exercise to determine exercise effects on
the number, distribution, and types of bacteria in the gut of breast cancer survivors. These changes will then be
linked to fatigue and physiologic effects of exercise to determine how the information can be used to enhance
exercise benefits and identify new treatment strategies leveraging changes in gut bacteria communities.",2019,616318,423828,192490,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Physical Activity; Prevention; Rehabilitation,LAURA Q ROGERS
1K08CA234209-01A1,Targeted Treatment of Metastatic Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroendocrine tumors derived from the tubular GI tract or pancreas (GEP-NETs) represent the second most
prevalent GI malignancy. Surgical resection can be curative, but 40% of patients present with metastatic
disease limiting resectability. These tumors often secrete bioactive hormones that can cause debilitating
symptoms. Debulking operations can provide palliation of symptoms, but are not curative and likely do not
confer any survival advantage. Various Notch isoforms have been shown to be tumor suppressive in NETs, as
opposed to oncogenic in other solid malignancies. Preliminary studies have suggested the Notch3 isoform acts
as a tumor suppressor in GEP-NETs. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown potential for
upregulating Notch3 expression in NETs and thereby suppresses tumor growth. However, these drugs have
had limited clinical applicability in other malignancies; largely in part to their undesirable side effects.
Nanoparticle delivery systems have previously been utilized to selectively deliver drugs to NETs by targeting
somatostatin receptors (SSTR), which are overexpressed in the vast majority of these tumors. This selected
targeting can reduce systemic side effects and improve drug efficacy. Our central hypothesis is that SSTR-
targeted HDACi-loaded nanocarriers can induce tumor suppression and decrease bioactive hormone secretion
in metastatic GEP-NETs via Notch3 induction. The proposed investigation will evaluate: 1) Mechanisms behind
HDACi induction of Notch3, 2) Cytotoxic capabilities of experimental nanoparticles, 3) Ability of targeting
system to tumor localize in animal model, and 4) Feasibility of patient-derived bioreactors as a personalized
method for drug testing.
Specific Aim 1: Identify the regulatory elements responsible for pharmaceutical induction of Notch3.
Specific Aim 2: Determine if tumor-targeted drug-loaded nanocarriers are selectively cytotoxic and
reduce hormonal secretion in GEP-NETs.
Specific Aim 3: Establish if bio-reactors engrafted with patient-derived GEP-NET are a viable model for
drug testing.
My training will be mentored by Drs. Herbert Chen (Professor of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering), James
Bibb (Professor of Surgery and Vice-Chair of Basic Research), and Eugenia Kharlampieva (Associate
Professor and Director of the Chemistry Graduate Program); as well as a panel of accomplished scientific
advisors within a highly supportive and productive training environment. My background in the pharmaceutical
industry and basic laboratory science provide me the resources to explore the mechanisms of Notch3 tumor
suppression at a biochemical level; while my position as a surgical oncologist allows for patient centered
context and readily accessible tissue. Data and training obtained through this award mechanism will provide
the necessary support to translate my preliminary data into preclinical human trials and evaluate new
mechanism for restoration of Notch3 by better understanding the epigenetics regulating its expression. This will
set the stage for an independent career in mechanistic studies and drug development related to GEP-NETs.","RELEVANCE
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are often found after they have already spread
to other organs, which typically removes surgery as an option to cure them. These tumors can
secrete chemicals that cause severe symptoms in patients and treatments are needed to both
control these symptoms and kill the tumor cells. This study investigates a new way to treat these
tumors and a new system for testing drugs against a patient's own tumor to see if the tumor
responds to treatment before giving the drug to the patient.",2019,158814,147050,11764,Other Research-Related,K08,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Nanotechnology; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Precision Medicine; Rare Diseases,John B Rose

Project Summary
Hypothesis-testing studies designed to understand the phenotypic, molecular and functional differences between
antigen-specific B cell subsets found in human lymphoid and peripheral mucosal tissues that are described in
this proposal will rely on several â€˜omics and other data-rich approaches and corresponding analyses to achieve
their goals. To support use of these platforms and their associated data analyses, we propose to provide unified
and integrated data and informatics services in Core D, the Data Analytics and Bioinformatics Core. The
core will cover three broad areas as reflected by the Specific Aims: data management, data processing pipelines,
and collaborative, downstream analysis. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to oversee and implement systems and
processes to manage donor demographic and sample processing metadata, resulting data sets (raw through
processed) and analysis provenance with all the appropriate linkages. This will benefit the Program by creating
infrastructure that can be efficiently used by all the Projects and Cores as well as promoting good data
stewardship practices which in turn, supports reproducibility. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to implement
standardized workflows to cover all of the high-throughput platforms used in this Program (by one or more
Projects): RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, B cell receptor sequencing (for Sanger sequencing as well as for
repertoires, by next-generation sequencing), and multi-parameter flow cytometry using semi-automated
approaches. This will benefit the Program by standardizing primary data processing across the Projects and will
promote comparability of results. In Specific Aim 3, we will provide collaborative downstream bioinformatics
analytical and statistical support for all three Projects. This will benefit the Program by serving as a resource
that all Investigators in the Projects can access for using data analyses to address their hypotheses, and by
centralizing this function, we will economize this support as the analytical needs and methodologies of the
Projects will overlap. Importantly, this will also enable creation of a molecular atlas of memory B cells and plasma
cells across tissues, integrating transcriptomic, phenotypic and B cell receptor repertoire data from the Projects
- we will assemble such a data set with an eye to future incorporation into a Data Commons environment. To
develop this Core, we have assembled a strong team with experienced leadership and talented individuals with
demonstrated expertise in all of the areas covered. Combining these three broad areas into a Core will maximize
efficiency, standardize process and promote scientific synergy across the Program.",,2019,309317,208294,101023,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Human Genome; Infectious Diseases; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD),Alexander  Rosenberg
1R56DK121299-01,Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Quality Control Parameters and Systemic Metabolism,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and type II diabetes (T2D) is associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. Current
pharmaceutical interventions have been limited in their ability to restore normal mitochondrial function, in part
due to limited therapeutic targets. To date, exercise is the best-known treatment for many of these metabolic
diseases. The positive effects of exercise are largely considered to be the result of both the quality control and
functionality of mitochondria. However, the molecular pathways regulating mitochondria quality control is not
fully understood. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1)
family of transcriptional coactivators have been identified as being important to mitochondria and ultimately
muscle function. The PGC-1Î± isoform has been credited with being the family member responsible for most, if
not all, of beneficial changes in response to exercise. However, we observed that deletion of PGC-1Î± in
skeletal muscle does not affect the adaptive changes in mitochondrial parameters. Moreover, we have also
shown that simultaneously deleting both PGC-1Î± and PGC-1Î² in skeletal muscle have profound effect on
mitochondrial function, but not mitochondrial content suggesting differences in mitochondrial quality control
parameters. These data suggest that other players are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function and
number in skeletal muscle. We are confident that the much-understudied family member PGC-1 related
coactivator (PRC) is this factor. In addition, the role PRC plays in skeletal muscle is unknown. Furthermore, the
observation that PRC is induced in response to exercise and that whole body heterozygote for PRC deletion
have a metabolic dysfunction, suggests strongly it plays a role in the exercise response. Therefore, the overall
objective of this proposal is to understand the role PRC plays in skeletal muscle with regards to mitochondrial
quality control and whole-body systemic metabolism. Using genetic models, diet induced and exercise
paradigms, cell-based and mitochondrial assays we will attempt to address this very important question.
Results from this proposal have broad implications for our understanding of metabolic disorders in skeletal
muscle as well as the role of PRC in skeletal muscle. The specific aims are to: 1.) to define the role of PRC in
skeletal muscle mitochondrial quality control, both during baseline and exercise training; 2.) to interrogate the
effect of diet-induced metabolic imbalance on mitochondrial quality control in adult skeletal muscle with
acquired mitochondrial oxidative capacity deficiency; and 3.) to demonstrate that exercise training preserves
mitochondrial quality control in adult skeletal muscle with impaired oxidative capacity. This proposal will to
provide much needed insights into our understanding of PRC in skeletal muscle and its contribution to
metabolic dysfunction.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

The UAB P30 Research and Translation Core Center consolidates a large number of externally funded cystic
fibrosis (CF) research programs on our campus, building an innovative environment to pursue, advance, and
train in CF-related science. During the last funding period, the P30 made robust and important contributions to
multiple UAB laboratories of our Research Base of over 70 investigators pursuing research relevant to CFTR
modulation, CF pathogenesis, and therapeutic translation. By virtue of the NIH Center, translational research at

to take advantage of these opportunities.
The P30 Center has allowed investigators at UAB and collaborating sites to improve understanding of CF
disease mechanism and has furnished novel opportunities to aggressively apply this information towards
experimental therapeutics. This NIH Center includes three Biomedical Research Cores that help to organize
efforts of CF faculty towards the common and essential goal of helping individuals with CF and to train the next
generation of CF leaders. The Cores include: Core A: Cell Model and Assay Core (B Woodworth and GM
Solomon, Co-PIs); Core B: Animal Models Core (DM Bedwell, PI); and Core C: Clinical and Translational Core
(SM Rowe and A Gaggar, Co-PIs). Each Core provides leading-edge assays, specialized reagents and
techniques, and valued expertise. The P30 has also engaged new investigators through a Pilot and Feasibility
mechanism integral to Center vitality and has a tight integration with the UAB Center for Clinical and
Translational Science, enabling a robust training environment. In addition to providing a platform from which
junior and senior scientists are brought into the field, Pilot Projects serve as a means of rapidly testing exciting

5R35HL135816-03,Translational Program in CFTR-Related Airway Diseases,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) maintains epithelial function by
acting as an ion channel at the apical surface of epithelial cells, and governs the formation of
mucus and its clearance. Genetic mutations of CFTR cause CF, and these mutations also
contribute to other airway diseases by altering host defense. We have helped discover that
CFTR dysfunction also can be acquired in the absence of congenital mutations, contributing to
the pathogenesis of the chronic bronchitis phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). To this aim, this Research Program will make decisive advancements in elucidating
the pathogenesis of airway diseases linked to genetic and acquired CFTR dysfunction, and will
apply this knowledge to develop new tools for their diagnosis and treatment. The Program will
encompass two focus areas critical to the mission of the NHLBI. The first will tackle fundamental
questions surrounding mucus clearance, using CF as the model. We will implement in vivo
Î¼OCT imaging, a technique we co-invented that provides an unprecedented view of the
functional microanatomy of the airway surface; perform innovative techniques to probe airway
mucus; and use a novel CF rat that exhibits delayed mucus clearance and an inherit defect in
host defense that develops over time to 1) illuminate mechanisms governing the formation of
mucus and its clearance, 2) develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting abnormal mucus
itself, and 3) establish mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to chronic bacterial
infection and novel strategies for bacterial eradication. In the second focus area, we will study
the role of these pathways in chronic bronchitis, a prevalent disorder that lacks treatments that
reverse its natural history. We will determine 1) the impact of acquired CFTR dysfunction in
ferrets, the first animal model of chronic bronchitis, 2) mechanisms of mucus stasis in the
human COPD airway (and contrast with CF), 3) whether acquired CFTR dysfunction increases
susceptibility to chronic bacterial infection or respiratory exacerbations in COPD ferrets, and 4)
test novel therapies for chronic bronchitis, including advancing CFTR potentiators for this
indication. There will be significant synergy between these studies, which will not only employ
cutting-edge techniques and animal models but also take advantage of our recognized expertise
in leading first-in-class human investigation into CFTR-directed therapies. Noting Dr. Rowe's
consistent track record of successes; the innovative, one-of-a-kind capabilities of his laboratory;
and the immediate feasibility of proposed objectives, this Program promises to transform the
field and uncover treatments that offer momentous improvements to duration and quality of life.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Pilot projects within the UAB P30 Center contribute to multidisciplinary research on our campus,
enhance faculty development, extensively utilize Scientific Cores, and integrate well with the
global research themes of the UAB Center. A strong and well-supported Pilot and Feasibility

Specific Aims. First, the Pilot Program identifies and supports new research projects of
outstanding quality and innovation. Projects typically last one to two years each, are concordant
with the overall objectives of the UAB P30, and are intended to result in further grant support
from NIH, Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation, or other funding agencies. Second, the Pilot
Program supports promising junior faculty in career development through funding of outstanding
pilot research. The Center Enrichment Program, strong mentoring within the CF Center, a
robust Enrichment program, and extensive training resources available at UAB through the
Center for Clinical and Translational Science (UAB's NIH-funded CTSA research program) are
also employed toward this end. Third, the Pilot Program augments the breadth and quality of CF
research by funding innovative projects from established researchers with valuable expertise
who are new to CF research, or alternatively from established CF investigators who want to test
new high-impact hypotheses. And fourth, the Pilot Program provides an administrative
framework for review and oversight of Pilot and Feasibility Studies. This includes broad
solicitation and rigorous peer review of Pilot applications, recommendations regarding 2nd-year
funding of Pilots to the Internal Advisory Committee, assistance and mentoring to pilot PIs, and
record-keeping with regard to publication and grant outcomes that result from pilot funding to
provide evidence for continuous process improvement. Overall, the Pilot Program has had a

Like cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD is characterized by mucus obstruction that is associated with
accelerated loss of lung function and excess mortality. Cigarette smoke exhibits a variety of
deleterious effects on airway epithelial function in vitro and in vivo and our preliminary data

decrement in mucociliary transport. Furthermore, CFTR dysfunction is independently associated
with chronic bronchitis and dyspnea, can persist despite smoking cessation, and can be
reversed by the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro and in vivo by activating wild-type CFTR,
resulting in a robust increase in mucociliary transport. Combined with unprecedented clinical
improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance observed in CF patients with a responsive
CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor, these data indicate that CFTR represents a viable
therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis (potentially
representing over 8 million patients in the U.S. alone). In this project, we will investigate the
hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with COPD who exhibit
chronic bronchitis. Though our preliminary data are compelling, questions regarding the most
informative and responsive endpoints and dose selection mandate the studies outlined in this
application. To address this, we have designed an innovative Phase 2, Randomized, Double-
blind, Placebo Controlled Pilot Trial to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Ivacaftor (VX-770)
for the Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (The Multicenter TOPIC study),
and will address a number of key questions to the field of COPD and airway epithelial biology
using the latest methods for assessing CFTR activity, epithelial function, mucociliary clearance,
and clinical outcomes. The TOPIC study will test whether MCC can be augmented in COPD
patients with chronic bronchitis, ameliorating human disease even in the absence of congenital
mutations in the CFTR gene. The trial will provide an initial proof of concept evaluating the
efficacy of CFTR potentiators in COPD, and we will also examine differential effects based on
race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and smoking status. If successful, the results could
establish a novel treatment paradigm to address mucus dysfunction in COPD, an important
cause of morbidity that is independently associated with mortality and disease progression.","Narrative
New treatments are needed to reverse mucus stasis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Ivacaftor is a new pharmacologic agent for the treatment of CF that also potentiates wild-type
CFTR activity, augments mucociliary clearance and reverses acquired CFTR dysfunction
caused by cigarette smoking. We propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in
COPD in a Phase 2 Clinical trial that will establish efficacy, mechanism of action, and target
population needed to develop an entirely new therapeutic paradigm for the third leading cause
of death in the U.S. that is over represented in the deep south.",2019,840450,699832,140618,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,MARK T DRANSFIELD; Steven Mark Rowe
5P30DK072482-13,Core C- Clinical and Translational Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Experimental techniques that require measurements in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and tissues have
demonstrated clear utility in CF science. Such capabilities have enabled advances including important
contributions to our understanding of basic aspects of disease pathogenesis, characterization of novel
therapeutics directed towards CF ion transport defects, and the evaluation of CFTR modulators in human
subjects. The purpose of Core C is to provide resources, expertise, and support to a wide variety of CF
scientists to assist projects with a strong translational focus requiring human subject interaction and
measurements in patients.
To this end, Core C carries out three main functions as delineated in the Specific Aims. First, the Core designs
and conducts in vivo measurements of CFTR activity in human subjects. This includes measures of ion
transport (nasal, lower airway, and sinus potential difference), which are diagnostic of the CF defect and can
be used to monitor the response to agents such as CFTR modulators that alter ion transport pathways, as well
as other means of assessing CFTR activity (e.g., sweat chloride, sweat rate, etc.). Second, the Core conducts
cardinal measures of mucus clearance in vivo, leveraging high-impact techniques including one micron
resolution optical coherence tomography (Î¼OCT) for in vivo use by endoscopic probes (complementing ex vivo
and in vitro imaging in Core A); whole-lung mucociliary clearance measurement by Tc99 clearance; and mucus
rheology and solid content assessment. And third, the Core provides support for the execution of CF clinical
studies. Clinical trial design and regulatory support; collection and storage of biospecimens; and support for
key clinical outcome measures that require careful technqiue in infants, children, and adults with CF are
included.
By employing a standard set of techniques, reagents, technical and regulatory support, and equipment in a
centralized facility, Core C helps to maximize consistency of assays, efficiency of human subject involvement,
and regulatory processes. Numerous projects within this P30 require in vivo assays of CFTR and clinical
outcome, whereas in vivo measurements of the mucociliary transport apparatus by Î¼OCT and other related
techniques have a high demand and are capabilities unique to our Center. In addition, the Core drives cost
savings by eliminating the need for establishing identical equipment in multiple laboratories and promoting
economy-of-scale for production analysis and storage of clinical data. Overall, P30 Core C conducts studies
well-integrated into the overall themes of the UAB P30, and provides capabilities and resources not otherwise
available to individual CF laboratories at our Institution and beyond.",,2019,226529,152544,73985,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases,Steven Mark Rowe
5R21HS026571-02,Examining the clinical workflow and outcomes of integrating health information technology to educate and support dementia caregivers,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The proposed project, â€œExamining the clinical workflow and outcomes of
integrating health information technology to educate and support dementia caregivers,â€ is a
comprehensive study that will evaluate the integration of CareHeroes, a web- and smartphone-
based health information technology (HIT) app into clinical care while supporting and
empowering caregivers of adults with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia (AD).
AD is a leading cause of disability worldwide and the stress and challenges of managing AD
symptoms often results in depression, burden, and compromised health for AD caregivers. AD
also disproportionately affects patients and caregivers who are African American and Hispanic.
Simultaneously, there are barriers for providers in collecting patient-related information to use
for AD clinical decision making and AD caregivers report challenges to shared decision making.
 HIT has been suggested as a way to address the challenges associated with AD clinical
care and caregiving, though little is known about how to utilize mobile technologies to link
caregivers and providers for clinical care. To address these issues, the research team has
developed CareHeroes, a multi-functional app that: educates AD caregivers, provides support to
AD caregivers, and provides a secure platform for AD caregivers to share patient-related
information with providers from the home or community setting in real-time. Following the
success of its feasibility study, this project proposes to integrate CareHeroes into the clinical
workflow of two memory clinics that serve large proportions of AD patients and caregivers from
disadvantaged backgrounds (Hispanic, African American, rural dwelling). As part of the study,
caregivers will use the app for a period of 12 months as a support for caregiving and to elevate
their role as part of the care team along with providers. The specific aims of this project are to:
(1) evaluate the feasibility of integrating CareHeroes into clinical workflow and the effects of its
usage on clinical and shared decision making between providers and caregivers; and (2)
examine the effects of usage of the app on caregivers' self-efficacy and health literacy.
 The findings will have high public health importance, because it will inform future efforts
on implementing HIT as an adjunct to AD clinical care, which may result in improved responses
to AD care and better physical and mental health outcomes for AD caregivers and patients. The
multi-disciplinary team has devised a feasible intervention and evaluation plan, led by PIs, Dr.
Nicole Ruggiano, Associate Professor of Social Work at the University of Alabama, and Dr.
Ellen Brown, Associate Professor of Nursing at Florida International University (FIU).","Narrative

9R01AI150901-10,Structural basis for HIV-1 Gag interactions with cellular and viral constituents,"During the late phase of HIV-1 infection, the Gag polyproteins are transported to the plasma membrane (PM) for
assembly. Gag targeting and assembly on the PM is dependent on specific interactions between its matrix (MA)
domain and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a signaling lipid localized on the inner leaflet of
the PM. Concurrent or subsequent to Gag assembly, the envelope (Env) protein is recruited to the PM for
incorporation into virus particles, a process that is dependent on Gag assembly. Several lines of evidence
suggest that incorporation of Env is mediated by interactions between the MA domain of Gag and the cytoplasmic
tail of gp41 (gp41CT), a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. For over a decade, we have pioneered
approaches to investigate at the molecular level how retroviral (HIV-1, HIV-2, MLV, and ASV) MA domains of
Gag interact with lipids (e.g., PI(4,5)P2) and membranes, a key requirement for understanding Gag assembly
and ultimately Env incorporation. A major barrier to characterizing gp41CTâ€“MA interaction has been the
unavailability of a recombinant gp41CT protein and the inability to reconstitute the proper conditions for the
interaction to occur. During this funding period we have recorded a breakthrough by determining the three-
dimensional structure of HIV-1 gp41CT and characterized its interaction with membrane. This achievement, an
elusive task for over two decades, filled a major gap by providing the structure of the last segment of HIV-1
proteome. In this renewal, we set our sights on elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Gag mediates
the recruitment of HIV-1 Env into assembly sites. We will test the hypothesis that trimerization of the MA domain
plays an important role in gp41CT interaction and therefore Env recruitment into particles. We will employ a
battery of structural biology, biophysical, and biochemical tools to generate a macromolecular picture of how the
MA domain of Gag binds to membrane and how it interacts with gp41CT. Our specific aims are: (i) Engineer
HIV-1 MA trimer and hexamer and characterize their binding to membranes, (ii) characterize the interactions
between HIV-1 MA and gp41CT, and (iii) determine the structure of MAâ€“gp41(TM-CT)â€“membrane complex by
single-particle cryo-EM. This proposal rests on a solid premise of: (1) 25 years of functional data that is waiting
for a molecular interpretation to provide sharper insights into Gag assembly on the PM and mechanisms of Env
incorporation, (2) highly technical skill sets for working with proteins, membranes, structural and biophysical
tools, (3) strong preliminary data, and (4) an outstanding collaborative team with 20-30 years of experience in
cryo-EM, x-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. Therefore, the proposed structural studies will provide
a detailed understanding of HIV-1 Gag assembly on the PM and Gagâ€“mediated Env incorporation. We hope that
the outcome of this proposal will help in the development of new antiviral therapeutic agents that inhibit assembly,
Env incorporation and ultimately virus production.","HIV remains a deadly pathogen that threatens human's life and the lack of efficient cure poses a
major problem in public health and safety. The proposed studies will help in understanding the

Program KL2 to focus on the growing gap between research and the translation of research into clinical
practice that has been labeled the â€œvalley of deathâ€. Our Partner Network brings existing training infrastructure,
ongoing partnerships, and complementary research expertise in diseases and disparities that are
disproportionately represented within an area of the southeastern US known as the â€œDeep Southâ€. We aim to
create a career development program that fosters â€œteam scienceâ€ and instills scholars with mastery of
translational research (TR) core competencies through an intensive curriculum that will nurture â€œtranslational
thinkingâ€ by helping Scholars use logic, imagination, intuition, and systemic reasoning, to examine potential
solutions to diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect the Deep South. Over the grant period, we
intend to provide enhanced training for 18 early career faculty scholars who will be supported by a
collaborative research base (109 mentors) supported by more than $315 million in extramural funding. Our
overall goal for this career development program is to facilitate new, and expand existing, innovative
opportunities to train early career faculty across the T1-TR spectrum in areas such as drug discovery
and development, integrative â€œomicsâ€, clinical informatics, and outcomes research aimed at
addressing disease and health care disparities that disproportionately affect the Deep South. We will
mentor these early career investigators towards becoming academic leaders within our CCTS Partner

5R21AR071684-02,REduCing Immunogenicity to PegloticasE (RECIPE),"Project Summary
Pegloticase is highly efficacious therapy for chronic refractory gout patients (n = > 400K in the US alone). It
decreases serum urate (sUA) levels to often undetectable levels and reduces tophi burden. However,Â its long-
term real world effectiveness is severely limited due to its immunogenicity caused by anti-pegloticase antibody
formation. REducing Immunogenicity to PEgloticase (RECIPE) is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo controlled,
proof-of-concept trial in 32 subjects initiating pegloticase for treatment of chronic refractory gout. RECIPE will
investigate the preliminary efficacy and safety of using immune modulating therapy with mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) to prevent immunogenicity conferred by pegloticase.Â  Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive MMF
vs. placebo in addition to everyone receiving pegloticase. The co-primary aims of the RECIPE trial are to 1)
determine if a 12 week course of immune modulating therapy with daily MMF can safely and significantly
attenuate immunogenicity to pegloticase as determined by the proportion of participants achieving and
maintaining an sUA less than or equal to 6 mg/dL through 12 weeks, compared to concurrent controls, and 2)
to assess the incidence and types of adverse events and infusion reaction. After 12 weeks of co-
administration, all participants will continue on pegloticase for an additional 12 weeks without combination
MMF immune modulating therapy to evaluate the longer term benefits (durability) and safety of this approach.
The secondary aims are to: 1) Determine the 6 month durability of immune modulation after discontinuation of
the short course of MMF by: a) assessing the absolute change in sUA from baseline to Week 24, and Week 12
to Week 24 and b) determining the proportion of participants with sUA â‰¤ 6 mg/dL through 24 weeks, and Week
12 to Week 24; 2) Identify and characterize the pegloticase immune response by immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG
and IgM), specificities, and antibody titer; and 3) Examine patient reported outcomes (PROs) using the NIH
supported Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Gout Impact Scale
(GIS) instruments. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the University of Michigan (UM), two
large academic gout and immunology research centers, which in aggregate see nearly 10,000 gout patients
annually, will serve as the two study sites and are very well-positioned to address the clinical and immunologic
questions posed. Our collaborative expertise, complemented by the leveraged resources of the NIAMS
supported P50 UAB Center of Research Translation (CoRT) in Gout and Hyperuricemia will be used to
execute this novel proof-of-concept trial with a long-term objective of improving gout treatment and quality of
life and better understanding the mechanism of pegloticase immunogenicity.","Project Narrative

project-focused disciplinary researchers into cross-disciplinary scientists and members of engaged
translational science teams. Translational science teams will allow for disciplinary barriers to be broken and
integration of unique perspectives and thought models to be incorporated so that scientific innovation can be
accelerated. Our Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Deep South Translational Thinker
Training Program (TL1) bridges fundamental discovery and clinical research through to population health by
enhancing interest in translational research and engaging our trainees in a curriculum that takes disciplinary
scientists and teaches them how to become multi-lingual members of cross-disciplinary translational science
teams. The overall goal of this proposal is develop future translational scientists by cultivating trainees
of diverse racial, ethnic, gender, disciplinary, and institutional backgrounds in a novel program of team
training, skill development, and community building. The CCTS TL1 has three main components: 1) the
Pre-TL1 Phase focuses on showcasing the value of translational science, the impact of clinicians and scientists
who can work in translational science teams, and on identification and recruitment of TL1 trainees; 2) the TL1
Research Phase immerses the trainee in a research experience with a skilled and productive researcher who
has an excellent mentoring track record and an actively funded research program focusing on translational
science. During this research phase that the trainees TL1 appointed trainees learn about cross-disciplinary
teams and translational thinking; and 3) the Post-TL1 Phase focuses on retention and continuing career
development for the trainees and will continue at least as long as the trainee is a member of our CCTS Partner
Institution community. Our CCTS TL1 program will train 15 pre-doctoral students annually from our Hub and
Partner Network who are enrolled in PhD, MD, DDS/DMD, DVM/VMD, PharmD, or dual-degree programs and
who are seeking a practical, cross-disciplinary introduction to clinical and translational research. This training

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modern antiretroviral treatments alter the progression of disease, enabling the majority of HIV+ individuals to live near-normal life spans. Yet, over 25% of patients in the US fail to achieve long-term virologic suppression, and even for those who do, there remains the threat of multiple comorbid complications. The critical questions that arise are how will clinicians maximize treatment success, assess the sociobehavioral barriers to linkage and persistent engagement in care, understand the causes of treatment and non-treatment related complications of HIV disease, and develop interventions that maximize health and well-being of HIV infected persons over many decades of life. To address these questions, investigators need access to clinical outcomes information that is tightly linked to biologic specimens and socio-biologic data to enable translational research. The CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) project is an established resource that has contributed substantially to the contemporary HIV research agenda. Established in 2002 and funded as an R24 research platform in 2006, CNICS is a clinic-based research network that reflects the outcomes of clinical decisions and management options used in the care of HIV infected individuals at 8 CFAR sites: UAB, U Washington, UCSF, UCSD, Case Western Reserve, Fenway Health (Brown / Harvard), U North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins. Quality-controlled data from the electronic medical records (EMRs) at each site are stored in a secure centralized repository and are linked to patient reported outcomes obtained at regular intervals, geospatial data, and to biologic specimens stored in repositories and readily available for use in translational research projects. The mission of CNICS is to provide access to the specimen and data repository to any investigator who submits an approved concept proposal. In this fashion, CNICS is a 'peer-reviewed open access' research platform available to investigators worldwide. The specific aims for this competitive renewal of CNICS are to: 1: Collect high quality data from a representative sample of patients; 2: Distribute data and specimens to a diverse array of scientists; and 3: Expand and formalize a state of the art mentoring program.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: AIDS is one of the largest pandemics in history that remarkably, in the 35 years since its first description, the etiologic agent was identified, accurae tests to detect its presence were created, and over 25 novel drugs developed.

Overall
The mission of the UAB CFAR is to support the conduct of cutting-edge research in basic science, therapeutics,
prevention, community engaged research, and clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of HIV and related
disorders. Five core facilities provide vital support for the Center's principal thematic areas of its scientific agenda.
To optimize our CFAR operation, an intensive strategic planning process has established efficiencies through
streamlining its cores from 7 to 5, taking full advantage of existing services provided by other centers on campus,
outsourcing under-utilized services, and allowing for investments in new areas (Specific Aims workshops,
Transplant Tissue Procurement Facility, and Ending HIV in Alabama SWG). The Center includes 185 members
from over 30 divisions and departments within UAB. Over the last 4 years, the UAB CFAR has enabled research
leading to FRB / total funding of $21M / $66M. The majority (62%) was newly obtained in this budget period;
57% of these are related to basic science, 18% to population health prevention and treatment research, 22% to
behavioral epi and intervention research, and 3% to community engaged research. Since our last renewal, the
center has increased the number of young investigators supported by training awards from 7 to 16 (14 women;
5 under-represented minorities, URMs) and invested $1.9M in new-investigator pilot awards yielding $25M in
outside funding. Overall, for our ROI in pilot funding is 13:1 in new extramural grants awarded. The Center helped
recruit 45 new HIV/AIDS investigators in the last 4 years (17 external, 28 new to HIV research), of whom 21 are
women and 5 URMs. Across all cores the CFAR supported 61 unique, NIH-funded projects (FRB) and 404 other
NIH-funded projects, of which 309 were HIV-specific resulting in over 1000 HIV publications, and in the garnering
of strong Institutional support. Over the next 5 years we will:
(1) Continue to enhance the productivity of ongoing research programs by enabling interdisciplinary research
through the provision of critical shared resource facilities and administrative and fiscal management support to
Center investigators (2) Use robust strategic planning methods to identify new research opportunities and
priorities that align with existing CFAR programs and foster new research programs where none are in existence,
but where faculty interest is evident; (3) Stimulate the entry of early stage and established faculty into HIV/AIDS
research programs through mentoring programs for young investigators and through a robust, peer-reviewed
Developmental Grants Program; (4) Provide a central focus for HIV/AIDS research activities at UAB that
emphasize effective communication and collaboration among CFAR members with the wider HIV/AIDS research
community; and (5) Promote faculty recruitment and program development in areas that reflect the ongoing
evolution of HIV/AIDS research in Alabama, the United States, and around the world.
The UAB CFAR will foster HIV/AIDS research that has high local, national, and international impact and in so
doing will promote the NIH priorities of innovation and effectiveness in AIDS treatment and prevention.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Administrative Core (Core A)
The Administrative Core (Core A) provides the leadership, organizational structure, planning, educational
opportunities and sound fiscal practices that propel CFAR investigators to achieve their highest scientific
potential through innovative, multidisciplinary research collaborations that is at the heart of the UAB CFAR
mission. The Administrative Core serves as the coordinating center for the entire UAB CFAR and is
responsible for the continuous monitoring, evaluation, and assessment of service provision to assure full
alignment with the strategic objectives of the Center. These critical functions are accomplished through high
level engagement of the CFAR leadership in the activities of the Center, including: Frequent and effective
communication with CFAR members, ongoing strategic planning, continuous monitoring of the effectiveness
and outcomes of services and activities, assessment of scientific developments in the HIV research
community, and alignment of existing scientific expertise and services at the UAB CFAR with these new
developments and the NIH priorities. The core strives to enhance diversity within the Center and the
development of early stage investigators to independence. Among the 45 new members recruited since the
last renewal, 65% are women, 25% are under-represented / ethnic minorities. Of the new grants on the UAB
funded research base this budget period, 38% were advanced with developmental pilot funding, demonstrating
an ongoing commitment to fostering independence. Through participation in strategic recruitments, pilot
funding and Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) / Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) the core enables
critical management tools to foster new, dynamic programs aligned with emerging trends in HIV research.
Since the last renewal, a cadre of 185 UAB HIV/AIDS investigators have been supported to work in a fully
collaborative and effective fashion, achieving over $66M in total HIV funding to the institution and supporting
over 1000 HIV publications. Leveraging a highly effectual administrative team, the core administrates several
nationwide NIH-funded HIV program projects based at UAB (e.g., the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical
Systems (CNICS), the Creative and Novel Ideas in HIV Research (CNIHR), the HIV and Aging Pilot Program,
the Womenâ€™s Interagency HIV Studyâ€™s joint site between UAB and the University of Mississippi Medical Center
(WIHS), and the Alabama Clinical Trials Unit) recovering over $500,000 in salary support annually. Through
these ongoing efforts, the Core will contribute new knowledge and approaches to curb HIV transmission,
improve preventative, therapeutics and clinical outcomes, and have maximal impact on the global

1R03DK119717-01A1,The Role of Kidney Immune Cells in Acceleration of Cyst Growth,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic kidney disease, with the
predominant form resulting from mutations in the gene, PKD1. In ADPKD, cyst expansion/tubular dilation leads
to a loss of nephrons and eventually to kidney failure. There are significant subset of ADPKD patients that
develop severe accelerated cystic disease leading to end stage renal disease earlier in life. Accelerated
cystogenesis may be due, in part, to the effects of â€œmodifying factorsâ€ a group of conditions that triggers a
phenotypic switch from slow to rapid cystic growth when superimposed on PKD. We have provided compelling
evidence that hypertrophic signaling is a critical modifier that stimulates rapid cystic disease progression.
Unilateral nephrectomy (UNx) and protein load both stimulates glomerular hyperfiltration and promotes rapid
cystic growth in mouse models of PKD. Interestingly, children with PKD that exhibit glomerular hyperfiltration
were shown to have a higher rate of cyst growth and faster decline in kidney function. Protein load/restriction in
murine models of PKD have been shown to promote/slow cystogenesis. Despite evidence of renal hypertrophy
accelerating cystogenesis, there is a gap in our knowledge of how hypertrophic signaling leads to rapid cyst
growth. Our new data from RNA-seq of kidney tissue comparing UNx to intact kidney from a sham operated
Pkd1 knockout mice, show differentially expressed genes involved in activating/recruiting macrophages and
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during the hypertrophic signaling. We also show preliminary results
that high protein diet significantly increases kidney weight/cystogenesis in adult Pkd1 mice. This proposal will
determine whether conditions which trigger renal hypertrophy (both UNx and protein load), activate kidney
(resident) macrophages and leads to accelerated cyst growth in adult PKD mice. We will also begin to examine
potential biomarkers linked to rapid cystic progression with a focus of identifying individuals at risk for accelerated
cystogenesis.","There is no cure for polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and once kidney damage starts to occur, there is a
universal decline in kidney function leading to end stage kidney disease. Some PKD patient loses their kidney
function rapidly compared to others, but the exact reason is unknown. A high protein diet or unilateral
nephrectomy (removing one kidney) increases kidney size (renal hypertrophy) and accelerates cyst growth in
PKD. We found that a group of blood cells that protects us from fighting infection, called macrophages, were
activated in PKD mouse after unilateral nephrectomy. This grant will determine whether a high protein diet and
UNx have common mechanism that leads to severe cystic kidneys focusing on kidney macrophage activation.
We will explore if there are any changes in gene expression in the kidney from this hypertrophic signaling and
determine if any of these genes can be detected in the urine which can potentially serve as a biomarker.",2019,111375,75000,36375,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Kidney Disease; Nutrition; Pediatric; Polycystic Kidney Disease,Takamitsu  Saigusa
5K08DK106465-05,Renal Mechanism for Hypertension in Polycistic Kidney Disease,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a ciliopathic disorder that results in multiple kidney cysts and hypertension (HTN), which eventually leads to kidney failure. A hallmark of PKD is the early development of HTN, which is inadequately controlled by conventional therapies including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In this regard, there is evidence for the activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in PKD. In PKD only 2 to 3% of nephrons become cystic and the development of hypertension should be dependent upon inappropriate reabsorption of salt and water by non-cystic nephrons; the most likely site would be at the collecting duct. Indeed we have previously shown, in an immortalized collecting duct cell line from a cilia deficient PKD mouse model, increased expression of aquaporin (AQP2) and mislocalized apical vasopressin receptor (V2R) leading to increased transepithelial salt and water absorption compared to a control. Therefore, we hypothesize that increased salt and water reabsorption by the collecting duct, which leads to HTN in PKD, may be due to mislocalization/altered activity and regulation by intrarenal RAS of critical transport proteins. Thus the first Specific Aim (SA1) is to determine if there is increase salt and water transport in the collecting duct from Ift88 and Pkd1 conditional knockout mice compared to control. This will be accomplished by: assessing salt and water transport rates in isolated perfused tubules; measuring channel activity by patch clamp of micro-dissected split open collecting ducts; and testing expression and/or mislocalization of transport proteins utilizing in vivo biotinylation. In preliminary experiments we found that renal angiotensinogen (AGT) is up-regulated in both Ift88 and Pkd1 knockout mice and hypothesized that AGT may be an effective target for blockade of intrarenal RAS. Therefore, we recently tested a novel antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting AGT and compared to conventional lisinopril therapy or no treatment in Pkd1 knockout mice and found that there was a significant reduction in the rate of renal cystic growth. AGT-ASO was not as effective as lisinopril in lowering blood pressure perhaps due to an AGT-ASO induced increase in renin levels. Therefore, (SA2) will determine the effect of inhibiting AGT or renin, or both, on hypertension and the rate of cystogenesis in Ift88 and Pkd1 models. This will be accomplished by determining whether AGT-ASO in combination with a renin inhibition (aliskiren) in Pkd1 and Ift88 conditional knockout mice leads to increased suppression of intrarenal renin, AGT, and angiotensin II levels, and whether this leads to better control of BP and a significant reduction in kidney cyst expansion compared to AGT-ASO treatment or lisinopril plus losartan. These proposed studies should lead to fundamentally new insights into the mechanism for PKD induced hypertension as well as test the therapeutic potential of a novel intrarenal RAS inhibitor for the treatment of HTN and renal cyst progression in PKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, there is no cure for Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) and once kidney dysfunction occurs there is a universal rapid decline in kidney function leading to end stage kidney disease. Therefore early treatment is critical. Hypertension is one early manifestation of PKD and these studies are designed to determine if cilia and /or polycystin1 dysfunction results in altered protein localization in the kidney increased intrarenal renin angiotensin system and thus lead to increased salt and water absorption and hypertension. This would have important implications in early stages of human PKD and may help in design of therapeutic agents to slow the progression of PKD.",2019,167616,155200,12416,Other Research-Related,K08,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Hypertension; Kidney Disease; Pediatric; Polycystic Kidney Disease,Takamitsu  Saigusa

5U54MD000502-17,"Project 2: Leveraging Ongoing Home Visitation Programs to Address Obesity Disparities among Underserved, Low-Income Mothers and Children","The proposed study addresses obesity and health-related disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged
mothers and their young children enrolled in federally-funded home visitation programs. This is important
because low-income and racial/ethnic minority mothers and their young children are especially at-risk of
obesity. The lack of access to evidence-based obesity efforts further contributes to these disparities. The
proposed randomized controlled trial tests the effectiveness of (1) a simple, evidence-based and ecologically
relevant obesity intervention (HABITS) delivered as part of ongoing home visitation services, compared to (2)
the existing home visitation curriculum without obesity-related content on mothersâ€™ and childrenâ€™s obesity risks.
HABITS focuses on habit formation and modifications to the food/activity home environment to promote
changes in the targeted weight-related behaviors. Participants will be 298 mothers (>50% African American;
100% meet federal poverty level) and their children (3-5yo at baseline) enrolled in our home visitation partner
in central Alabama. Home visitors will be randomly assigned to deliver the home visitation curriculum with or
without HABITS as part of their weekly home visits for 12 months. Assessments of mothers (weight, waist
circumference, feeding practices and habit strength of targeted behaviors), children (rate of weight gain), and
household environment (availability/accessibility/visibility of cues conducive to targeted food, activity and
monitoring behaviors) will be conducted at enrollment, 12, and 24mo (1y post-treatment follow-up). Aim 1
(primary outcomes). To compare the effects of treatment on children and mothersâ€™ weight outcomes at 12
and 24mo. Hypothesis 1a: Mothers receiving HABITS will have a lower weight and waist circumference than
mothers receiving standard services. Hypothesis 1b: Children receiving HABITS will have slower rate of weight
gain than children receiving standard services. Aim 2 (secondary outcomes). To compare the effects of
treatment on maternal feeding practices, habit strength of targeted behaviors, and features of the household
environment relevant to targeted behaviors at 12 and 24 mo. Hypothesis 2: Compared to standard services,
HABITS will result in heathier maternal feeding practices (less fried foods and SSB; more vegetables/fruits),
greater habit strength of targeted behaviors, and greater home availability/accessibility/visibility of cues that
support targeted behaviors. Aim 3 (maternal/environmental transmission of childrenâ€™s obesity risk). To
test whether maternal and household environment variables mediate the effect of HABITS on childrenâ€™s rate of
weight gain at 12 and 24mo. Hypothesis 3: Maternal weight, feeding practices, habit strength of targeted
behaviors, and household environment will mediate the relationship between HABITS and childrenâ€™s rate of
weight gain. We will further explore whether primary (Aim 1) and secondary (Aim 2) outcomes differ for African
American and White mothers and children, and whether race moderates the relationships between maternal
and household environment variables and childrenâ€™s rate of weight gain (Aim 3).",,2019,327125,409511,197451,Research Centers,U54,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Childhood Obesity; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Prevention,Sarah-Jeanne  Salvy
5I01BX003374-03,Impact of N-Myc interactor on metastatic progression of breast cancer.,"With increased participation of women in the military there is an increased need to effectively diagnose,
manage and cure breast cancer in the veteran population. The invasive and metastatic nature of this cancer
poses a formidable challenge. Our long term goal is to identify therapeutic avenues to effectively treat
metastasis of breast cancer. The objective of the proposed work is to understand the mechanistic and
functional consequences of the loss of a gatekeeper protein NMI, on breast cancer metastasis. We
hypothesize that loss of NMI unleashes unwarranted activation of Hh signaling and enhances the propensity
of breast cancer cells to metastasize. As our first Aim, we will employ thorough investigation using
innovative experimental approach to elucidate the mechanistic and functional consequences of NMI loss on
Hh driven metastatic progression of breast cancer. We will use a unique reagent created by us, to
determine whether the modulation of Hh signaling is via classical Hh ligand-dependent or non-classical Hh
ligand-independent mechanisms. We will characterize the molecular events that lead to activated Hh
signaling and interrogate the outcomes on cancer cell attributes of stemness, drug resistance and
mesenchymal phenotype. We also will employ in vivo assays that encompass xenograft studies and
investigations with genetically engineered mouse models that will enable us to specifically query activation
of Hh signaling in situations of NMI loss. In the second Aim, we will develop an understanding of the
correlative expression between NMI and molecular signatures of metastasis in tumor specimens derived
from Stage IV breast cancer patients. We will follow upon our findings that NMI expression is compromised
in hypoxic conditions, a finding with profound implications for metastasis; and test an innovative pre-clinical
pharmacological inhibition strategy to reduce metastasis of breast cancer that is devoid of NMI. Collectively,
this Aim will allow us to strengthen the clinical (translational) applicability of our observations and lay the
foundation to move towards a future clinical trial.","The invasive and metastatic nature of breast cancer is responsible for its lethal attributes and thus makes it
a leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Breast cancer shows a significantly high incidence in

5R01CA194048-04,Dietary intervention of non-classical Wnt signaling,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The invasive and metastatic nature of breast cancer poses a formidable challenge due to the associated therapeutic resistance, disease relapse and mortality. The behavior of cancer cells is dictated by their interaction with their surrounding tissue. Osteopontin (OPN) is a critical component of breast stroma. OPN is overexpressed in over 70% cases of malignant breast neoplasms and its overexpression is indicative of poor prognosis. OPN potentiates malignant properties of cells, specifically by promoting their ability to grow, invade, and metastasize. Wnt signaling is dysregulated in breast cancer. We showed that mis-regulation of Wnt homeostasis results in EMT activation and malignant progression. We also demonstrated that DNAJB6, a member of HSP40 family of chaperones, interferes with Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and in fact, acts as a gatekeeper of EMT resulting in reduced metastasis. In invasive progression of breast cancer, DNAJB6 protein expression is compromised. Loss of DNAJB6 expression is one of the key factors that promote secretion of OPN by the tumor cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that OPN activates Wnt-ligand independent, non-classical Î²- catenin signaling, leading to malignant progression of breast cancer. This non-classical activation of Î²- catenin activity has profound implications with
respect to tumor progression, multi-drug resistance and importantly to Wnt inhibitors being tested in the clinic. Based on compelling observations regarding its ability to counteract Wnt signaling, and restore DNAJB6 expression, we propose to test the dietary flavonoid, fisetin for reversing or preventing EMT and resistance to drug treatment. Fisetin is abundantly present in mangos, strawberries etc. and thus are an affordable means of dietary supplementation. Our objectives are (i) To characterize the mechanisms and effects of non-classical activation of Î²-catenin signaling and  (ii) To determine if fisetin serves as an effective functional food to revere EMT and prevent metastasis. We will also test fisetin's impact on improving sensitivity of breast cancer cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The outcome will allow use of fisetin as a dietary intervention to block non-classical Î²-catenin signaling due to OPN in the tumor microenvironment. The work will also test prevention strategies to intervene in metastatic dissemination of breast cancer. Impact: Considering the emphasis of ongoing clinical trials on inhibition of Wnt signaling, the proposed work will have immediate impact on the course of ongoing clinical trials. This research has the potential to complement costly and debilitating chemotherapy regimens.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to define, treat and prevent the impact of osteopontin in prompting non-classical Wnt signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and chemoresistance of breast cancer using chemo-dietary intervention.",2019,326174,221887,104287,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Breast Cancer; Cancer; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition; Prevention,Rajeev S Samant

In 1979, an NEI Core grant was first awarded to UAB. Over the next 35 years, the institution's continued
commitment to growth resulted in a remarkable expansion in vision research. Participants have now increased
from 13 in two departments to 23 in five departments, and there has been a concomitant increase in
extramural funding. Eleven of the Core participants currently hold 14 eligble grants, another 7 have NEI new
investigator status and are seeking NEI R01 support (four of these have submitted NEI R01s). Of the
reminaing five participants, two are Co-Investigators an an active NEI R01 and three have submitted NEI
R01s. Annually, NEI funding exceeds $3M million, not including internal UAB awards. Total annual extramural
funding for vision-related research at UAB has grown to nearly $13 million. A major research focus of the
participants is visual neuroscience, with 16 actively involved in anatomical, biochemical, physiological, or
psychophysical studies of the retina and central visual pathways. Additionally, UAB vision research groups are
focused on the study of glaucoma, AMD, myopia, keratoconus, dry eye and cataractogenesis. This application
requests funds to continue to provide services and facilities to support the research activity of the participants
through four professionally staffed cores. These cores provide state-of-the-art facilities and expertise in
dedicated spaces designed specifically for each purpose. The Instrumentation Core is staffed by an
electronics engineer who designs and builds complex novel electronic apparati and an expert machinist/tool
and die maker who designs and fabricates unique mechanical devices. Both also repair and maintain current
instruments greatly reducing repair costs. The Research Programming & Computational Analysis Core
provides access to high-end analytical tools and is staffed by an experienced programmer/analyst with an MS
in computer sciences who offers custom software development and software/hardware interfacing, and by a
part-time experienced biostatistician who will assist in experimental design and statistical analysis. The
Molecular & Cellular Analysis Core is staffed by an MD/PhD trained scientist who provides expertise for
study design, training and access to major instrumentation for DNA, RNA and protein studies and morphologic
analysis of tissues and cells. The new Ocular Phenotyping Core will be part-time staffed by a PhD who has
several years of expertise in the use of all instrumentation for analysis of the structure and function of small
animal models of human ocular disease. Since 1979, more than $17M has been provided in institutional
support of vision research to date and more than $800,000 is committed over the next 5 years of requested
NIH support. UAB vision science is in an exciting growth phase that is focused on the use of advanced
technology and the recruitment of the best scientists to study and devise treatments for ocular disorders. The
continuation of the P30 core grant for vision research is an essential element at the core of new discovery in
vision science at UAB.","UAB Vision Science Research Center- Overall Core

5R01EY027316-03,Central Nervous System Control of Intraocular and Intracranial Pressure,"Abstract
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, yet the reason for retinal ganglion cell damage within the
optic nerve head (ONH) is not fully understood. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered the primary
cause of glaucoma, but recent studies suggest that decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) also contributes to
glaucoma pathophysiology. IOP and ICP are dynamic, and evidence suggests that they are at least partially
under central nervous system (CNS) control. Understanding the neurophysiologic mechanisms that control IOP
and ICP variations is critical to understanding glaucoma pathogenesis and progression. Our lab has shown for
the first time that chemical stimulation of the dorsomedial hypothalamus and surrounding perifornical area
(DMH/PeF) in rodents evokes increases in IOP and ICP; however, there is a temporal shift in the time for each
of these measures to peak. This results in a change in the trans-ONH pressure difference (i.e. IOP minus ICP)
that is greater than the change in IOP or ICP alone. Further, defining this CNS pathway and the
neurotransmitters involved in IOP and ICP regulation may provide targets for novel glaucoma therapies aimed
at stabilizing the human translaminar pressure difference.
The primary focus of this grant is to examine the CNS pathways controlling IOP and ICP, the primary drivers of
the translaminar pressure difference in humans. Our central hypothesize is that central regulation of IOP and
ICP is controlled, at least in part, neurons located in the DMH/PeF region. To test this we have proposed 3
specific aims: 1) We will pharmacologically characterize the increases in IOP and ICP after site-directed
stereotaxic chemical stimulation of the DMH/PeF region using selective antagonists to various neurotransmitter
receptors. 2) We will attempt to define the central nervous system afferent inputs to and efferent targets of the
DMH/PeF neurons that might control IOP and ICP by using site-directed stereotaxic microinjections to
stimulate various central nervous system nuclei and record the changes in IOP and ICP. 3) We will examine
the role of certain specific neurotransmitters in regulating circadian changes in IOP and ICP by molecular-
based and pharmacologic-based inhibition of the neurotransmitter system while using radio-telemetry to record
IOP and ICP.","Project Narrative
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, yet we are still trying to develop a fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms that cause this disease. While we know that increased eye pressure is a risk
factor for glaucoma, recent evidence also indicates differences between eye pressure and brain pressure may
also be a risk factor. The research described in this application is aimed at investigating how the brain controls
both eye pressure and brain pressure with the goal of identifying novel treatment options for patients with
glaucoma.",2019,373389,263666,109723,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Brian Christopher Samuels

Small animal models of human disease have provided important insights into renal pathophysiological
processes and are an important preclinical resource to test therapeutic and preventive approaches in acute
kidney injury (AKI). The specific aims of Core B are to provide the facilities and requisite skills 1) to study
murine models of AKI, 2) for small animal imaging, and 3) to determine renal pathophysiological changes in
AKI. This core will specifically provide (i) expertise in development and training in the use of rodent models of
AKI specifically in the setting of ischemia/reperfusion injury, sepsis and kidney transplantation, (ii) a multi-
modality small animal imaging core that will provide state-of-the-art molecular imaging, including functional,
structural and metabolic imaging using magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, high frequency
ultrasonography, microCT, gamma-ray imaging (gamma camera, microSPECT/CT, microPET/CT), and optical
imaging (bioluminescence and fluorescence), and (iii) a physiology core that will provide expertise and training
for studying renal function on the whole kidney and at the single nephron level, including micropuncture
techniques and determination of GFR, microanalysis of tubular fluid and tubular reabsorption, renal
hemodynamics with assessment of tubuloglomerular feedback, and metabolic assessment of kidney oxygen
consumption in rodents. Core B will also provide technical expertise for the isolation of primary tubular and
vascular cells from rodents.
The intent of Core B is to provide unique resources that help overcome barriers for investigators to utilize
relevant rodent models for in vivo studies and rodent kidney cells and cell lines for in vitro studies to advance
understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. Core B has been very successful in supporting the kidney
research community. Since the inception of the O'Brien Center, Core B has performed more than 12,000
procedures for 200 investigators. A steady number of investigators use Core B each year. In the present
funding cycle, of the 120 investigators, 91 (76%) were non-core investigators. Core B has also supported the
research efforts of 20 Pilot and Feasibility and Catalyst grant awardees. These combined efforts have been
currently recognized in 105 peer-reviewed publications. The sophisticated infrastructure coupled with the
unique expertise of Core B will continue to catalyze collaborative activities of our investigator base and

5P30DK079337-12,Pilot and Feasibility Program,"Project Summary
 The principal objective of the UAB-UCSD O'Brien Center Pilot and Feasibility (PAF) Grants Program is
to provide seed funds for new, outstanding, and innovative research proposals related to AKI. These pilot
funds will provide eligible investigators with one to two years of support along with the resources necessary to
explore investigator-initiated projects related to AKI.
 The UAB-UCSD O'Brien Center PAF Program will have a tri-partite focus with a mission 1) to attract
junior faculty to AKI-related research; 2) enable established investigators in other fields to explore the feasibility
of new, innovative concepts in AKI-related research; and 3) entice investigators with research expertise in the
Core Center's thematic areas to apply their expertise to AKI-related questions. The PAF Program has been
successful in this mission. There is a high level of recurring interest, with an average of 19 applications/year in
response to our RFAs. All funded applications were judged to be highly meritorious by our study section, which
consists of our intramural experts. The Program has recruited 12 physician-scientists and 11 Ph.D. scientists,
including promising faculty from institutions outside UAB and UCSD. Eighteen of the 23 investigators funded
by this program were new to the AKI field, and about 83% have remained in kidney-related research. These
investigators have demonstrated significant productivity, including 39 peer-reviewed papers published by pilot
recipients funded during this cycle. At present, collectively the 23 recipients have a 66.7% success rate in
obtaining subsequent extramural funding. The UAB-UCSD O'Brien Center PAF Program will continue to
leverage institutional resources ($335,000 during the present cycle) at both UAB and UCSD, which will permit
an increase in the total investment for our Pilot Program recipients. Three to four awards per year will continue
to be supported by this program, with two supported by O'Brien Center funds and the additional 1-2 from
institutional funds.

5R01AG050567-04,Histone H4 Lysine16 Acetylation in Aging and Lung Fibrosis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age related fatal disease with unknown etiology. Its incidence increases with age, environmental effects is important. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, are major causes of age-related diseases. Environmental stressors and aging contribute to histone modifications. Epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible. We and others have established that epigenetic mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of IPF. Aging may potentiate the susceptibility to environmental stress by modulating pro-fibrotic cellular phenotypes in IPF. However, studies of epigenetic regulation, in particular histone modifications and their related cellular phenotypes in the aging lung and in IPF are lacking.  Chromatin structure, which is affected by histone modifications, is an important determinant of the cell phenotype. The active histone mark H4K16Ac epigenetically regulates gene expression. Our preliminary data demonstrated the dysregulation of this histone modification in IPF fibroblasts. We hypothesize that age-related histone modifications, in particular H4K16Ac, mediates fibrotic cell phenotype, promotes senescence and induced apoptosis resistant lung fibroblasts that leads to persistent fibrosis in aging. Targeting this histone modification will alter pro-fibrotic ell phenotypes and promote resolution of fibrosis. Our specific aims are: (1) Determine mechanisms that regulate H4K16Ac in persistent lung fibrosis associated with aging. (2) Determine the role of H4K16Ac in regulating pro-fibrotic phenotypes in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. (3) Determine the efficacy of targeting H416Ac in an aging mouse model of persistent lung fibrosis. The proposed studies will define the role of age-related histone modification H4K16Ac in the pathogenesis of IPF, and translate that knowledge to novel therapeutic interventions for pulmonary fibrosis.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an age related fatal disease with unknown pathogenesis and associated with high mortality.

5R01CA211752-03,"Heparanase in Tumor Progression, Metastasis and Chemoresistance","The long-term goal of our work is to understand how heparanase promotes the
aggressive behavior of tumors and to use that knowledge to develop curative cancer therapies. We have
identified multiple mechanisms through which heparanase drives cancer progression, metastasis and
chemoresistance and established heparanase as a viable target for cancer therapy. Moreover, we catalyzed
collaborative efforts aimed at developing and testing novel anti-heparanase drugs and demonstrated their
efficacy in pre-clinical models of cancer leading to a currently ongoing clinical trial. The challenge now is to
maximize anti-heparanase therapy to enhance its anti-tumor effects; a goal that will be attained through a
thorough understanding of heparanase mechanisms of action. The overarching hypothesis guiding our work is
that heparanase is a master regulator of the aggressive phenotype of cancer, an important contributor
to the poor outcome of many cancer patients and a prime target for therapy. This hypothesis is supported
by studies focused predominantly on the impact of heparanase expressed by tumor cells. Our latest
discoveries have revealed two novel, previously unexplored mechanisms related to heparanase regulation of
cancer. We found that: (i) heparanase expressed by non-tumor (host) cells within the microenvironment can
substantially contribute to tumor progression, and (ii) tumor secreted exosomes can shuttle heparanase to
recipient cells and enhance their chemoresistance. Our working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that heparanase
produced by host cells acts within the tumor microenvironment to support and accelerate tumor growth,
metastasis and chemoresistance. This will be studied in pancreatic carcinoma and myeloma tumors growing in
mice that express different levels of host heparanase (transgenic and knockout mice). We will investigate the
type of host cells involved (e.g., macrophages, stromal cells), their impact on tumor progression and
chemoresistance and the ability of heparanase inhibitors to block those effects of host heparanase. Our
working hypothesis for Aim 2 is that heparanase present as cargo in exosomes is delivered to recipient tumor
cells and enhances their chemoresistance. We will determine mechanistically how exosomes drive
chemoresistance and investigate the potential of anti-heparanase therapy for inhibiting exosome-mediated
chemoresistance. In addition, work in Aim 3 will develop new, highly specific anti-heparanase monoclonal
antibodies as anti-cancer therapeutics. The proposed work is significant and innovative because it couples the
discovery of new heparanase mechanisms of action with the objective of maximizing anti-heparanase therapy
and improving patient outcome.","Heparanase is a protein made by cancer cells that plays a major role in helping them grow and spread

5R01HD091155-02,Treadmill Walking Exercise Training Effects on Cognition and Brain Function in Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematically-Developed Randomized Controlled Trial,"Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent, poorly-managed, and disabling in persons with multiple sclerosis
(MS). Exercise training is a promising approach for managing cognitive dysfunction in MS; however, results
from previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been equivocal. This is inconsistent with the well-
established literature from the general population that consistently documents beneficial effects of exercise
training on cognition and brain function. Indeed, the MS RCTs suffer from significant methodological flaws
and are not on par with the rigor of exercise training studies on cognition in the general population. To that
end, we recently completed a line of research that identified progressive (i.e., both intensity and duration)
treadmill walking exercise as an optimal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive processing
speed (CPS; the most commonly impaired cognitive domain in MS) and thalamocortical resting-state
functional connectivity (RSFC), in particular, among fully-ambulatory persons with MS. To that end, the
purpose of the present proposal is to conduct an adequately-powered, single-blind, RCT, using an active
control condition for improving CPS and brain function in cognitively-impaired persons with MS at a single
research site. This study will examine the effects of 3-months of supervised, progressive chronic treadmill
walking exercise (designed based on pilot work) compared with a placebo control condition (i.e., stretching-
and-toning activities) on CPS, fMRI (i.e., thalamocortical RSFC), and functional outcomes in 88 persons with
MS who present with slowed CPS. We will collect data on CPS, thalamocortical RSFC, and functional
outcomes at baseline and follow-up (i.e., at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period) time points.
We hypothesize that treadmill walking exercise training will result in significant improvements in CPS,
thalamocortical RSFC, and functional outcomes. We further speculate that improvements in thalamocortical
RSFC might explain exercise-related improvements in CPS. If successful, the proposed study will provide
the first Class I evidence for the effects of treadmill walking exercise training as a rehabilitative approach to
improve CPS, its neural correlate, and functional consequences in persons with MS who need such an
intervention the most. This line of research will lay the groundwork for the development of exercise training
guidelines that can be adapted by clinicians for use by MS patients for specifically improving cognition and
brain health. Such an evidence-based approach for rehabilitation, using exercise training, is paramount
considering the prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed nature of MS-related CPS impairment. This is
consistent with the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Researchâ€™s mission to foster development of
scientific knowledge needed to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of persons
with physical disabilities.","Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent, poorly-managed, and disabling in persons with MS and exercise

7R21CA216763-03,Development of a novel antiangiogenic drug for colon cancer by targeting neuropeptide Y receptors,"Abstract
The long - term objective of the proposal is to investigate the efficacy of neuropeptide Y receptor 2 (Y2R)
antagonists as newer and effective anti-angiogenic drugs in advanced colon cancer. Recent reports from the
clinics indicate increased resistance to the currently used anti-VEGF-A drugs, the most common anti-
angiogenic agents approved for the treatment of advanced colon cancer patients. This thus necessitates
identification of newer and effective anti-angiogenic drugs targeting other proangiogenic molecules in colon
cancer. Our preliminary results indicate significantly higher expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in malignant
colon tumor tissues collected from advanced colon cancer patients and orthotopic human colon cancer in
mice. In addition, we also observed increased expression of Y2R in tumor endothelial cells (TEC) in these
patients and in orthotopic tumors. Because our preliminary data also indicate that NPY can stimulate the
proangiogenic functions of normal colon endothelial cells and as significantly increased angiogenesis was
observed in colon cancer, it is therefore possible that NPY regulates angiogenesis in malignant colon tumors.
The experiments here are designed to investigate the regulatory role of NPY in colon cancer angiogenesis
and the effects of targeting Y2R in TEC in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and thereby growth of colon cancer.
Aim I will investigate the effects of inhibition of Y2R by specific antagonists either alone or in combination with
standard anti-cancer agents, on angiogenesis and growth of metastatic colon cancer in a preclinical murine
models simulating advanced colon cancer and Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular signaling pathways by
which NPY regulates tumor angiogenesis. Finally, the knowledge generated from this proposal may not only
identify a novel regulator of malignant colon tumor angiogenesis, but can also suggest a newer and an
effective therapy for the treatment of advanced colon cancer patients.","Narrative
Colon cancer represents a major cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity and is the third most common
cancer in men and women and affects approximately one million people every year. With reports of emerging
resistance to anti VEGF agents, the results from the proposed preclinical study may form the basis of a new
and an effective antiangiogenic therapy for colon cancer using neuropeptide Y2 receptor antagonists in future.

5U54MD007585-28,GASTROINTESTINAL SITES REGULATE REDUCTION OF BODY WEIGHT BY GASTRIN-RELEASING PEPTIDE,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)
Treatment of obesity requires an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the short-term control of food
intake, i.e., factors that reduce individual meal size (MS); prolong the time between two consecutive meals,
known as the inter-meal interval (IMI); and result in reduction of body weight. The proposed effort will involve
evaluation of the anti-obesity effects of the short-term satiety peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) by
testing the hypothesis that, if, in diet-induced obese rats, GRP is injected in low amounts and at
highly specific gastrointestinal sites, it effectively and safely reduces MS and extends the IMI
(i.e., increases satiety), resulting in reduction in body weight. There are three Specific Aims: Specific
Aim I: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s) of action controlling MS, IMI length, and body weight (BW)
by endogenous GRP released by a normal meal. Specific Aim II: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s)
of action controlling MS, IMI length, and BW by exogenous GRP-10 (a COOH-terminal decapeptide of GRP)
and GRP-29 (a large molecular form of GRP). Specific Aim III: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s) of
action controlling MS, IMI length, and BW by endogenous GRP released by peptone. In addition, the safety of
infusions of the peptides and antagonists will be evaluated by examining the morphology and weights of the
specific gut sites of action following single and chronic infusions of GRP. We will test these three aims by
innovative approaches, including use of (a) microvascular catheterization of the major arteries and their
branches in the gut, (b) a sensitive enzyme immunoassay that determines the levels of GRP in response to
meals; (c) immunohistochemical detection of Fos-like immunoreactivity, a marker for neuronal activation in the
enteric neurons and in the dorsal vagal complex; (d) diet-induced obese rats; and (e) the automated BioDAQ
feeding apparatus. This work will establish, in diet-induced obese rats, the specific site(s) of action regulating
meal size, IMI, and BW by endogenous and exogenous GRP and will determine if GRP can be tested in
humans as an anti-obesity medication.",,2019,257249,174999,82250,Research Centers,U54,National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities,TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY,AL,TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE,Domestic Higher Education,360883606,Digestive Diseases; Nutrition; Obesity,Ayman I Sayegh
5R01HL121513-05,Bicarbonate regulation of the pulmonary endothelial barrier,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood bicarbonate, which is in direct contact with the endothelium, can become elevated during respiratory diseases or following infusion (i.e to correct acidosis associated with lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies), yet its effect on the endotheliul are unknown. Na+-bicarbonate cotransporters (NBC) transport bicarbonate into cells. In the cytosol, bicarbonate can activate cytosolic adenylyl cyclase isoform 10, AC10, which generates cytosolic cAMP and disrupts the pulmonary endothelial barrier. The goal of this proposed research plan is to understand how the NBC is regulated and the mechanism of AC10 induced permeability in the setting of acute lung injury (ALI). It has been observed that while transmembrane AC generates juxtamembrane, barrier protective cAMP, the toxic bacterial soluble AC, ExoY, generates, barrier disruptive cAMP and increases permeability. Increased permeability contributes to the mortality and morbidity of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, understanding how NBCs regulate AC10 activity and how endogenously generated cytosolic cAMP regulates pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity to exacerbate ALI and ARDS is of clinical interest. Specifically, in vitro, in situ and i vivo experimental models will be used to determine whether Na+-bicarbonate cotransporters and AC10 contribute to bicarbonate influx and generation of cycotsolic cAMP signals in pulmonary endothelial cells derived from either conduit arteries or the gas exchange segment of the vasculature, the septal capillaries (Specific Aim 1). We will determine whether the NBC, NBCn2, is inhibited by juxtamembrane cAMP signals (Specific Aim 2) and whether bicarbonate transport through NBCn2 to activate AC10 is required disrupt microtubule architecture and disrupt the endothelial barrier (Specific Aim 3). Techniques to be used include: immunohistochemistry and fractionation studies to determine NBC expression between different vascular beds; pH and sodium measurements to determine NBC activity; both cell-free and in-tact cell measurements of cAMP using cAMP turnover and radioimmunoassay in addition to spatial and temporal FRET-cAMP measurements using hyperspectral image analysis; immunoprecipitation assays and site directed mutagenesis to identify phosphorylation sites on NBCn2; Western analysis with phospho-specific antibody to detect changes in tau phosphorylation; detection by detection of free versus polymerized tubulin to identify changes in microtubule architecture; video microscopy, permeability and resistance measurements to detect changes in endothelial barrier integrity in vitro; and the isolated perfused lung model to measure the filtration coefficient (Kf), lung wet/dry ratio and alveolar fluid volume fraction in stu. Further, we will perform additional isolated lung studies following intraperitoneal LPS administration to induce ALI. These experimental technique and various experiment groups will be used to test our hypothesis.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine how bicarbonate and cAMP signals contirubte to pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption during acute lung injury (ALI). This project is of clinical significance because blood bicarbonate can become elevated during respiratory diseases, is in direct contact with the pulmonary endothelial cells and can activate soluble adenylyl cyclase isoform 10 (AC10) to generate barrier disruptive cAMP signals. Thus, a greater understanding of bicarbonate regulation of the pulmonary endothelial barrier will facilitate the development of novel and beneficial therapeutic interventions.",2019,303000,200000,103000,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,366880002,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Lung; Rare Diseases,Sarah Louise Sayner
1R01DK122473-01A1,Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging
wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time
analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered
intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and
theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the
synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and
nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion
Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g.,
eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The
goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among
individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2)
define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate
JITAIsâ€™ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct
a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized
JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory
(SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success.
To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors
quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the
device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual
curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for
personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a
second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants.
We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the
AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks
(weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior
compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and
7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The
proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors
associated with excess EI.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive.
Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior.
Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and
weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning,
behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic

5R21CA217638-02,"Development, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Smoking Cessation Intervention Tailored to Rural Young Adult African American Men: Toward Scalability","Abstract
Despite smoking fewer cigarettes daily, African American (AA) men suffer higher
morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco-related disorders than whites. Our
preliminary data shows that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who
resided in rural Alabama smoke cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a
combination of pharmacotherapy and advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive
behavioral interventions are efficacious in promoting smoking cessation across diverse
populations, these evidence-based treatments for tobacco dependence have not proven
to be effective/efficacious (or even accessible) among some subpopulations suffering
disproportionally from tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this
feasibility study is to make adaptations to these evidence-based approaches, and
develop, implement, and examine the feasibility and scalability of a theory-based,
culturally relevant smoking cessation intervention for young adult AA men in rural
Alabama who smoke cigarettes. Our formative assessments point to a cognitive-
behavioral intervention delivered by a trained Community Health Worker with the support
from an â€œexpertâ€ physician who can deliver the pharmacological component via Skype
through an integrated approach. The proposed study will address the next three steps in
this process: development of the intervention, pretesting, and feasibility. First, we will
develop the intervention with input from a Community Advisory Committee, followed by
an iterative process by which the target audience will be exposed to materials and
messages to provide feedback (pretesting). Once all intervention components are
finalized, we will recruit participants, randomly assign them to intervention/control
groups, pilot test, and evaluate the intervention. The comparison group will be the
Alabama Tobacco Quitline with 8 weeks of Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be
consistent with the pharmacological approach proposed for the intervention. The primary
outcome will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as no cigarettes in the past
7 days and verified through measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide levels) at 6-
month follow-up. We will also conduct detailed treatment fidelity and scalability
assessments (acceptability, feasibility, potential reach and adoption, alignment with the
strategic context) to inform a full-scale efficacy trial.","Project Narrative

5K01OH011183-02,Advancing Workplace Safety Surveillance with Ambulatory Inertial Sensors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are prevalent in the United States and are a major cause of
disability and lost productivity. Occupational health and safety (OHS) personnel employed in industries that
commonly report a high incidence of MSDs, such as manufacturing, are often responsible for evaluating and
modifying workspaces to prevent these conditions. Such efforts are often limited, however, by the routine
use of imprecise and biased self-report and/or observational-based exposure assessment methods.
Ambulatory inertial sensors (AISs) are innovative, objective, and valid direct measurement technologies that
have recently emerged as an alternative to self-report or observational-based methods for assessing exposure
to physical risk factors in occupational settings. Despite their small size, decreasing costs, and ubiquitous use
among the general public, the vast majority of OHS personnel employed in manufacturing do not currently
deploy AISs for workplace health and safety surveillance. This project will address three methodological
research gaps that currently prevent the adoption of AISs among OHS personnel. First, AISs will be deployed
among a stratified sample of 36 manufacturing workers performing cyclic and noncyclic work tasks (over 15
complete working days for each participant) to capture time-series estimates of workplace exposure to
selected physical risk factors. This data will be used to estimate the number of work days that must be
sampled to obtain stable exposure estimates and guide the selection of future sampling strategies. Second, a
workplace OHS â€œdashboardâ€ will be developed, evaluated, and implemented that summarizes direct
measurements obtained from the AISs to better inform operational decision making. Finally, the effects of
using the AIS driven dashboard on exposure to physical risk factors and safety behaviors will be assessed in
the context of stakeholder perception of safety climate.
This proposal addresses several strategic goals identified in the Exposure Assessment and MSD Health and
Safety Cross-Sector Programs as well as the Manufacturing Industry Sector of the National Occupational
Research Agenda (NORA). The primary expected outcome is an increased understanding of how AISs may be
applied to improve workplace safety surveillance and reduce workplace injuries and illnesses. Outputs will
include journal and conference publications as well as an innovative Research to Practice (R2P) tool designed
to reduce the incidence and severity of MSDs and promote healthy workplace behaviors. An early career
scientist whose career goal is to become a prominent independent investigator who specializes in the design,
evaluation, and application of proactive workplace interventions that consider organizational characteristics to
prevent MSDs will gain invaluable experience and training.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

2R44NR015928-02A1,"A Next Generation, Low Cost Tracking System for Healthcare Process Validation (2)","PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: America's health care system remains challenged by tens of billions of dollars of fraud and
inefficiencies. Lost and stolen equipment cost about $4,000 per hospital bed, increasing to $8,000 when
expenses incurred from out-of-place equipment are added. In addition, a 2017 report estimates $95 billion was
lost to fraud, waste, abuse, and other improper payments in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Real Time Location Systems (RTLS) are an emerging technology that promises to increase the visibility and
efficiency of clinical workflows. There is no clear market leader. Low-cost solutions have poor accuracy, and
high-accuracy solutions are too expensive. For instance, The Veteran Administration's $543 million foray into
medical RTLS has been deemed â€œa catastrophic failure.â€ The problem and opportunity are highly significant.
Investigator(s): Dr. Hans G. Schantz of Q-Track has more than forty patents and managed over $10 million in
sponsored research at Q-Track. Professors Jung Hyup Kim and Laurel Despins at the University of Missouri
will evaluate and optimize the proposed innovations with respect to clinical end-user needs.
Innovation: Q-Track's pioneering low-frequency approach to indoor location â€“ Near-Field Electromagnetic
Ranging (NFER) provides sub-meter accurate location results in the most challenging environments including
a third of U.S. nuclear plants, health care facilities, military training sites, and other industrial facilities. Cost has
limited adoption to broader markets. This effort aimed to achieve a radical reduction in cost by a factor of two.
In Phase 1, Q-Track dramatically demonstrated feasibility, lowering the retail price of a Locator-Receiver from
$2750 to $600, while maintaining 40 cm or better accuracy. Taking an existing NFER RTLS deployment at the
Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital, University of Missouri Health Care in Columbia, Missouri as a
baseline, Q-Track's Phase 1 success drives the overall NFER RTLS cost from $2191/bed to $1474/bed.
Phase 2 builds on this successful outcome with sub-meter accurate, low cost (<$1000/bed), RTLS using an
innovative low-frequency approach. In Phase 2, we lower the cost of the QTag location tag in a redesign. We
compliment sub-meter accurate medical personnel tracking with Asset Tag Tracking capability using $1-$2
Bluetooth Low Energy active asset tags. We further implement user-centric data analytics to understand and
characterize health care operations. U.S. Patent 8,326,451 further describes Q-Track's innovative approach.
Approach: Finally, we will collaborate with academic researchers to deploy a pilot at an Intensive Care Unit.
Our pilot will track medical personnel and assets. Our study assesses the ability of the system to characterize,
optimize, and validate health care operation in real-world settings to detect fraud and achieve efficiencies.
Environment: Our partnership with Dr. Kim and the ICU at the University Hospital, University of Missouri

5F31NS106722-02,Border-associated macrophages in an alpha-synuclein overabundance model of Parkinson Disease,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal aims to determine the contribution of the border associated macrophages (BAMs), and
inflammatory signaling from these cells, to monocyte infiltration and neurodegeneration in an alpha-synuclein
based mouse model of Parkinson Disease (PD). Our lab has pursued the idea that innate immune system
activation in response to Î±-syn is a trigger for such neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD, and has
implicated peripheral monocytes and microglia in model progression. Increasing evidence from both postmortem
tissue and PD blood and CSF has highlighted the role of inflammation in the disease, as microgliosis and
lymphocyte infiltration is found surrounding pathology and degeneration. Additionally, pro-inflammatory
cytokines are elevated in PD post-mortem brain and CSF, while chemokines such as CCL2, which is important
in CCR2+ monocyte recruitment to tissues, are robustly elevated in PD blood. Mouse models recapitulate key
features of the innate immune activation, peripheral cell infiltration, and neurodegeneration found in PD.
However, BAMs have key roles in peripheral immune cell recruitment and extravasation into the CNS, but have
largely been ignored in PD research. This proposal attempts advance our knowledge of CNS inflammatory
mechanisms by investigating the hypothesis that Î±-syn induced BAM activation and CCL2 secretion is required
for inflammatory monocyte recruitment and neurodegeneration.
 Using an in vivo model in which Î±-syn overexpression is produced using an adeno-associated virus
(AAV), increases in microglial MHCII expression, BAM number and MHCII expression, and number of CCR2+
pro-inflammatory monocytes have been observed. Furthermore, prevention of monocyte recruitment through
CCR2 knock-out is neuroprotective and prevents microglial MHCII expression. The proposed project will first
investigate the activation status of BAMs in response to Î±-syn, using flow cytometry, FACS, and a qPCR cytokine
and chemokine array in the AAV2-SYN model of PD. Next, BAMs will be specifically depleted to determine their
functional role in Î±-syn induced peripheral immune cell infiltration. This will be measured through flow cytometry
and immunohistochemistry. Finally, depletion of BAMs and re-population with CCL2 knock-out peripheral cells
will be used to determine their role in inflammation and neurodegeneration. These studies use bone marrow
chimeras, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and stereology to determine protection from inflammation and
neurodegeneration.
 Parkinson disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, but remains without
sufficient treatments. This proposal aims to elucidate the role of BAMs in communication between the brain and
periphery during PD progression. This study would provide rationale for targeting chemokine signaling and
myeloid cells as an innovative target for the development of PD therapeutics.","Project Narrative
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, but current therapeutic
treatments are either ineffective or produce severe and permanent side effects. The proposed studies will help
to elucidate roles for border associated macrophages in the communication between brain and periphery that
leads to a deleterious inflammatory response in PD models. Additionally, contributing chemokines and cells
types may be identified as possible therapeutic targets to halt disease progression.",2019,36235,36235,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Aubrey Michelle Schonhoff
5R21AI134027-02,Role of VpreB in immunoglobulin antigen binding site selection,"Project Summary
In many infections (e.g., HIV or influenza), the preimmune repertoire may include few or no broadly neutralizing
antibodies against critical epitopes. We seek to understand why some epitope reactivities are rare, and others
more common. Complementarity determining region 3 of the heavy (H) chain (CDR-H3) lies at the center of
the antigen binding site. It is the direct product of VDJ rearrangement and N addition. It is thus the focus for
preimmune repertoire diversification. The first Ig quality control checkpoint tests whether nascent Î¼ H chain
(Î¼HC) will associate with VpreB and Î»5 to create a functional preBCR. Our premise is that preBCR selection of
the preimmune repertoire restricts subsequent BCR epitope recognition and B cell antibody production. We
examined the CDR-H3 repertoires of early and late preB cells from DH-altered mice, and then of living and
apoptotic early and late preB cells of WT mice. PreBCR checkpoint passage was associated with selection for
tyrosine (Y) at CDR-H3 101. The hydroxyl group of Y101 is positioned for multiple interactions with VpreB
CDR-H3 sensing site amino acids R51, D57, and R101 (RDR). We will test the hypothesis that the CDR-H3
sensing site of VpreB creates an invariant antigenic epitope that selects particular CDR-H3 amino acids and
thus shapes the binding characteristics of the antibody repertoire. For this developmental R21 application, we
propose to test the role of VpreB RDR in controlling the prevalence of particular amino acids in CDR-H3 and to
establish model systems for future testing of the role of VpreB selection on epitope recognition and antibody
production. In Aim 1, we will create Î¼HC expression vectors with Y101-containing V domains cloned from
living late preB cells that have passed preBCR selection, and V domains cloned from apoptotic early preB cells
with disfavored amino acids at 101, such as leucine, that have failed preBCR selection. We will create
mutated VpreB expression vectors with alanine (A), glycine (G) or valine (V) substitutions for RDR. These
Î¼HC and mutated VpreB expression vectors, along with Î»5, will be introduced into a preBCR negative proB cell
line in which the formation and function of preBCR can be monitored by downstream signaling calcium flux.
These in vitro studies will define residues in VpreB and CDR-H3 that are critical for optimal preBCR formation
and function. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to selectively mutate VpreB RDR to A, G or V. We will
examine patterns of cell cycling and apoptosis in developing B cells from mice with mutant VpreB. We will
sequence VDJCÎ¼ transcripts from living and apoptotic preB cells from these mice, and then assess sequence-
structure correlations by molecular modeling. These in silico and in vivo studies will define the role of the
VpreB CDR-H3 sensing site in preBCR formation, signaling, and checkpoint passage, and its effect on the
preimmune repertoire and antibody functional activity. As per the developmental nature of this application, in
future R01-funded studies these VpreB mutant mice will be used to test the role of preBCR selection in
regulating epitope recognition and thus shaping the immune response to pathogens and self-antigens.","Project Narrative
The bone marrow generates B cells capable of producing a large array, or repertoire, of highly diverse
antibodies. Each antibody has the potential to defend against infection or to promote autoimmune disease.

disease.",2019,185625,125000,60625,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Genetics,Harry William Schroeder

1R15AG064655-01,A new vertebrate model to study the role of growth factors IGF1 and IGF2 in sex dimorphism of longevity and aging.,"Women live longer than men, and different age-related diseases afflict women and men at
different rates. Our poor understanding of the basis of these sex-differences promote disparities
between men and women in the success of treatments of age-related diseases. The Insulin and
Insulin-like Signaling (IIS) molecular pathway is known to regulate longevity. The overall goal of
the proposed research program is to test if hormones that regulate the IIS pathway contribute to
sexual dimorphism in longevity and aging. Research on one of these hormones, IGF2, has been
limited by the lack of an animal model that naturally expresses IGF2 in adulthood. To overcome
this barrier, this research will use a novel model system, the brown anole lizard, which naturally
expresses IGF2 through adulthood similarly to humans, to address questions on the role of
IGF2 in aging. This proposal has two Specific Aims that include experiments both in a brown
anole laboratory colony and in a lizard cell culture system. Specific Aim 1 uses a longitudinal
experiment at the organismal level to define the respective roles of IGF1 and IGF2 in sexual
dimorphism of aging and longevity. Specific Aim 2 uses cell culture experiments to test whether
the male cellular environment is pro-aging, and if sex differences in IIS signaling become
programmed with age. This contribution will be significant because it will remove a blind spot in
our knowledge on the function of the somatotropic axis on the sex-specific biology of aging by
developing and using an alternative terrestrial vertebrate model and comparative approaches
that are synergistic with established models. Furthermore, the integration of research and
undergraduate education with this project is designed to provide extensive hands-on research
experience related to the biology of aging for 50+ undergraduate researchers annually. The
proposed research and developed methodology will open new avenues of research, currently
unattainable with our standard model systems, on IGF2 and other top regulators of the IIS

5R21HD095270-02,Using Bluetooth Beacon Technology to Reduce Distracted Pedestrian Behavior,"Using Bluetooth Beacon Technology to Reduce Distracted Pedestrian Behavior
 Over 4,800 American pedestrians die annually (CDC, 2017), a figure that is current increasing. One
hypothesized reason for the increasing trend in pedestrian injuries and deaths is the role of mobile technology
in distracting both pedestrians and drivers. Existing behavioral interventions to reduce distracted pedestrian
behavior are few. We propose to develop and then evaluate Bluetooth beacon technology as a means to alert
and warn pedestrians when they are approaching dangerous intersections, reminding them to attend to the
traffic environment and cross the street safely rather than engaging with mobile technology. Our proposed
research will be conducted in three phases: (a) technology development, (b) internal testing, and (c) crossover
research trial to evaluate efficacy of the program.
 Bluetooth beacons are very small (about the size of a dime) and inexpensive (~$20 range) devices that
broadcast information unidirectionally (beacon to smartphone) within a closed proximal network. We propose
placing beacons at intersection corners (e.g., on signposts) frequently trafficked by urban college students. The
beacons will transmit to an app installed on usersâ€™ smartphones, signaling users to attend to their environment
and cross the street safely. The app will be developed to be flexible based on user preferences (e.g., visual
warnings, aural warnings, vibrations, phone screen frozen); for research purposes, the app also will download
data concerning the usersâ€™ behavior while crossing the street (e.g., user stops using phone, puts phone in
pocket, text-messages, leaves music playing, etc.). Iterative internal pilot-testing will improve the app, and then
we will conduct a small pilot study (N=30) to gather further data for refinement. Following this, a crossover trial
will evaluate the app with a sample of 411 young adults whose behavior is monitored for: (a) 3 weeks without
the app being activated, (b) 3 weeks with the app activated, and then (c) 6 weeks without the app activated to
assess retention of behavior. Throughout the 12 week period, we will monitor user behavior at multiple
intersections around campus, along with gathering self-report questionnaire perceptions and behavior at
baseline and 12-week post-intervention assessments.","Narrative

1R01HD099131-01,Using Interactive Virtual Presence to Remotely Assist Parents with Child Restraint Installations,"Using Interactive Virtual Presence to Remotely Assist Parents with Child Restraint Installations
 Motor vehicle crashes cause the death of an American child every 3 hours. When installed correctly, car
seats (also called â€œchild restraintsâ€) reduce risk of serious injury and death to infants and young children in a
crash roughly threefold. Unfortunately, a very large portion of child restraints traveling on American roadways
is installed incorrectly. A network of trained technicians, many affiliated with Safe Kids Worldwide, work across
the country to assist parents in achieving correct use of child restraints through scheduled â€œcar seat checks,â€
where technicians cooperate with parents to install restraints in their vehicles. Car seat checks are effective in
reducing errors in child restraint installations. However, the services are highly underutilized due to barriers in
access, scheduling complications, and resources to staff the car seat checks sufficiently to meet demand.
 The present study evaluates use of interactive virtual presence technology (also called interactive merged
reality) â€“ joint and simultaneous remote verbal and visual interaction and exposure to the same 3D stimuli â€“ to
remotely assist parents to install child restraints correctly into their vehicles. If effective, this technology could
supplement or replace car seat checks, significantly reduce the number of errors made in car seat installations
nationwide, and revolutionize how government, industry, and non-profit agencies help parents install restraints.
 Building from small preliminary studies on the topic, we propose a large randomized non-inferiority trial to
evaluate whether parents, including especially underserved parents in rural areas and/or of underrepresented
racial or ethnic minority background, who install child restraints while communicating with a remote expert
technician via interactive virtual presence achieve installations and learning that are not inferior in their safety
to parents who install restraints live with a remote technician on-site. Non-inferiority trials are a type of
randomized trial whereby a novel treatment (in this case, interactive virtual presence to install child restraints)
is compared to an existing treatment known to be effective (in this case, live one-on-one installation of
restraints) to demonstrate the novel treatment does not perform inferiorly to the existing treatment known to be
effective. To accomplish our goals, we will recruit 1476 parents at 7 Safe Kids locations nationwide and
randomly assign consenting parents to install their child restraint either via interactive virtual presence or with a
live technician. The correctness of installation safety will be assessed using objective checklists, both following
installation and again 4 months later. We aim to demonstrate that child restraint installation is accurate (>90%
correct) when conducted remotely via interactive virtual presence, that such installations are not inferior to the
accuracy of installation with a live on-site expert, and that parents learn and retain information about correct
child restraint installation.","Narrative

development for several high profile biopharmaceutical drugs and biologics in recent efforts. It is apparent that
the current methods and standards for preclinical toxicity testing require improvement. Recently, DBM
launched a new Online Store and offers 2D tissue culture (TC) plastic-grown human cell platforms of kidney,
lung, skin and the vasculature for HCT testing. To build upon these initial offerings, DBM seeks to design and
establish 3D cell mono-culture and co-culture platforms for human kidney cells, so as to deepen the creativity
and innovation of our Online Store offerings. In addition to preliminary data generated on 2D cell culture
platforms, DBM has begun to establish and optimize 3D Biogel-based culture platforms where normal renal
epithelial cells form tubule-like and duct-like structures, along with spherical fluid-filled cysts. Moreover, DBM
has established 3D â€˜barrierâ€™ co-culture platforms where polarized human renal epithelial cell monolayers form
on permeable filter supports and where vascular endothelial cells or other relevant cell types on grown
immediately beneath the epithelium. Preliminary designs and results will be shared. In addition to the
establishment of such 3D cell culture platforms, DBM wishes to test important hypotheses. First, do any FDA-
approved drugs, known industry standard drugs, or drugs currently in clinical trials display cellular toxicity in
DBMâ€™s kidney HCT testing platforms? Second, does DBMâ€™s HCT approach have more value when human cells
are studied in 3D cell culture formats vs. 2D formats? DBM has been hesitant to pursue this line of research
since defined HCT is not yet the â€˜gold standardâ€™ for lead therapeutic asset toxicity testing as mandated by the
FDA or other regulatory agencies. It is DBMâ€™s view that this needs to change, so as to save time, resources,
and animal lives that are wantonly wasted on a drug or biologic that could be identified early as harmful with
DBMâ€™s HCT. Our milestones that DBM wishes to meet include: to offer existing 2D HCT testing platforms for
kidney so as to begin to change the culture and methods used to ensure the safety of lead therapeutic assets;
to design new 3D HCT testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature; to optimize and test new 3D HCT
testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature versus existing 2D HCT testing platforms; and, finally, to
explore microfluidics â€˜chipâ€™-based 3D HCT testing platforms for kidney and renal vasculature.","DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM) is establishing new paradigms for human cellular toxicity (HCT) testing so as to

environment and from consumed goods), and materials (nanomaterials for drug formulation and delivery, etc.)
at an early stage so as to save the enterprise and marketplace time, money and resources in both R&D and

Project Summary Abstract
Bitter taste in foods and medicines presents a barrier to overcoming global public health challenges: food
insecurity, poor nutritional health, and poor compliance with medication use, particularly among children and
the elderly. Sugar and salt, the mainstays to address these challenges, further erode nutritional health, and
current alternatives have adverse taste attributes of their own. We propose to develop a reliable, human taste-
cell screening platform to find bitter blockers of commercial interest to the food, flavor, and pharmaceutical
industries, with the aim to improve the taste and acceptance of nutritious and sustainable foods and medicines.
This Phase 1 STTR proposal has the following goals: (a) to establish immortal human taste-bud-derived
epithelial cell cultures and lines (i.e., hTBEC platforms) from donors with bitter-sensitive genotypes and (b) to
design, optimize, and implement hTBEC-based bioassays of bitter taste receptor function and other key end
points to produce readout data for high-throughput screening (HTS). This proposed research is the initial step
toward our ultimate goal of executing a full HTS-based campaign to discover and validate bitter taste receptor
antagonists from phytochemicals, phytochemical derivatives, and botanical extracts and extract fractions. This
commercial-academic collaboration between DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. and Monell Chemical Senses Center
brings together expertise in (a) culture of human taste cells, (b) the creation of immortalized cell lines, (c) HTS,
and (c) genetics and human sensory analysis. The hypothesis is that hTBEC-platform-based bioassays will
provide a more relevant and robust way to identify new bitter antagonists, given the imperfect current methods
of overexpressing known taste receptors in heterologous cells. The discovery of bitter taste receptor
antagonists that alone or blended will block bitter taste can improve healthy eating by reducing reliance on salt
and sugar and can improve compliance by patients taking medicines. Thus, new bitter blockers will improve
human health.

providing postdoctoral scholars with outstanding research and teaching experiences while
improving the recruitment of under-represented groups into the field of biomedical and
behavioral research.
 The MERIT Program is facilitated through a partnership of UAB, Stillman College,
Oakwood University and Lawson State Community College; all schools are located in Alabama
within a 100 mile radius. In this second competitive renewal, the research component continues
to incorporate laboratory-based instruction together with ethics training and professional skills
development, including instruction in grant writing and time and laboratory management. The
teaching component remains comprised of four key elements: i) teaching-related coursework; ii)
one-on-one mentoring of an undergraduate student; iii) course development; and iv) class-room
and on-line teaching experiences. New programmatic elements include new and expanded
partnerships at Stillman, Oakwood and Lawson State; enhanced academic job preparation;
culture awareness mentor training; increased MERIT Scholar resources; and expanded
institutional commitment.
 During the current grant period, assessment of the MERIT Program has indicated that: i)
its scholars have progressed in their research and teaching abilities and job placement
opportunities; ii) career development and the recruitment of underrepresented groups have
increased at the host institution; and iii) science-related curriculua, the number of

5R00DE025913-04,Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by oral commensal streptococci and nitrie-mediated activity,"Project Summary/Abstract
Streptococcus mutans is the major etiological agent of dental caries, the most prevalent infectious disease
world-wide. Biofilm formation by the cariogenic bacterium S. mutans is crucial for the pathogenesis of dental
caries. Preventing or successfully treating severe caries remains an elusive task. The conventional treatment
for dental caries usually involves the mechanical removal of dental biofilms, the use of antibiotics, or invasive
procedures. However, these treatments are sometimes ineffective and the use of antibiotics or invasive
procedures can result in the development of drug resistant pathogens or complications. Therefore, an
alternative and less invasive approach is needed. Interestingly, the oral cavity exhibits higher concentrations of
nitrite than other body sites. Elevated concentrations of nitrite in the oral cavity have been associated with a
reduced prevalence of dental caries, suggesting that nitrite may be an alternative therapeutic for the treatment
of caries. However, the exact mechanism(s) of how nitrite interferes with the biofilm formation and
pathogenesis of S. mutans is unknown. The oral cavity harbors hundreds of bacterial species and they interact
with each other and contribute to health and disease status of the oral cavity. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that the hydrogen peroxide-producing oral commensal Streptococcus parasanguinis, inhibits S.
mutans growth and biofilm formation in the presence of nitrite, revealing a new anti-infection strategy by the
commensal oral streptococcus. In order to develop nitrite-containing therapeutics to treat dental caries, it is
critical to understand mechanisms of S. mutans nitrite resistance. Transposon mutagenesis of S. mutans
identified mutants that are resistant to S. parasanguinis and nitrite-mediated activity. One mutant is mapped to
a gene coding for a histidine kinase (SMU.486). This histidine kinase and its response regulator (SMU.487)
are homologous to a nitrite sensing two-component regulatory system in Escherichia coli, suggesting that they
may mediate inhibition of S. mutans by S. parasanguinis and nitrite. Therefore, the immediate goal of this
research proposal is to investigate how the nitrite sensing two-component system SMU.486 and SMU.487
mediate S. mutansâ€™ response to nitrosative stress and identify nitrosative stress response pathways controlled
by SMU.486 and SMU.487. RNA-sequencing/transcriptomics will be used to analyze how SMU.486 and
SMU.487 contribute to nitrosative stress resistance. In addition, the proposal will examine the ability of S.
parasanguinis and nitrite-mediated activity to inhibit S. mutans and prevent caries in an animal model of dental
caries. During this time the candidate will complete mentored training in Oral Microbiology, RNA
sequencing/transcriptomics, and other professional development activities. The mentored training will prepare
the candidate for the independent R00 phase in which the candidate will determine the suitability of S.
parasanguinis as a probiotic in addition to continuing the characterization of other transposon mutants that
confer resistance to S. parasanguinis and nitrite-mediated activity. The University of Alabama at Birmingham
provides an exceptional environment for the candidate to receive mentored training and complete the outlined
research due to the collaborative research environment, and state of the art facilities.","Project Narrative

the tooth surface and promote tooth decay. This project aims to examine how reactive nitrogenous
intermediates produced from the utilization of nitrite by oral commensal bacteria play a role in inhibiting S.

5R21AR070097-02,Mechanisms of growth plate organization in response to mechanical load,"Longitudinal growth of limbs occurs through cartilaginous structures called the growth plate at the 
ends of each bone in a process called endochondral bone formation. One important feature of the 
growth plate is that the cells in the tissue align into columns. While the magnitude of bone growth 
is dependent on cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and cell enlargement during hypertrophy, the 
columns allow directional growth of the bone. It was noted that a large proportion of children with 
paralysis in one leg as a result of poliomyelitis or hemiplegic cerebral palsy demonstrated 
significant limb length discrepancy with the paralyzed limb being shorter than the other limb. 
Based on these observations we hypothesized that mechanical load regulates the function of the 
growth plate. While the effects of mechanical load on bone remodeling have been studied 
extensively, little was known about the role of loading on endochondral bone formation and limb 
length determination so we developed in vivo models for removing mechanical load on hind limb in 
young mice via paralysis. Loss of mechanical load resulted in shortening of the paralyzed limb, 
disorganization of the columnar architecture in the growth plate, and disruption to the cortical 
actin structure within the cells. Very little is known about how chondrocytes align themselves into 
this columnar structure because isolated chondrocytes in culture do not align into columns and in 
vivo models are time consuming and expensive to work with. In addition, there are limited methods 
to view the biological processes involved in real time. In this R21proposal we plan to address a  
critical barrier in the field and develop an ex vivo organ culture system and live cell imaging 
assays to measure changes in protein localization and tension at cellCcell and cellCmatrix adhesion 
sites during column formation in real time.  We will then illustrate how the mechanisms involved in 
column formation in loaded and unloaded conditions can be analyzed in detail using these assays. 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern how mechanical load affects growth plate 
function would be expected to inform future strategies for treating various types of limb length 
disorders.","The shape and size of limbs are determined by many factors including load caused by weight and 
gravity. In this exploratory study we will develop a practical model to address mechanical loading 
in skeletal tissues and live cell imaging techniques that can be used to determine the mechanisms 
of growth plate function in response to mechanical load.
Understanding the details of growth plate function will form the basis for treatments of various 
limb length disorders.",2019,163350,110000,53350,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Cerebral Palsy; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period,Rosa A.

5R21AG058839-02,PERK inhibition as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease,"Disturbance in the folding capacity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prompts a
cellular condition known as ER stress. ER stress is induced in neurodegenerative diseases
including Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). PERK is one of the major ER stress sensor proteins
which can be activated by misfolded protein in ER luminal domain to initiate the ER stress.
Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that the PERK activation is closely associated
with the pathogenesis of AD. PERK activation can lead to overexpression of BACE1, the
deposition of amyloid Î² (AÎ²) plaques and the phosphorylation of tau protein. Prolonged
PERK activation may also cause the neuronal loss by apoptosis. Solid data from AD animal
models have shown that depletion or inhibition of PERK may exhibit substantial
neuroprotection and reduce the amount of AD-related plaques in the AD brains. However,
the existing PERK inhibitors are ATP-analogues and represent high toxicity and low
specificity in vivo. Our data support the hypothesis that misfolded proteins can directly
interact with PERK to activate the PERK signaling pathway. We propose to identify novel
inhibitors of PERK that can block the interactions between PERK luminal domain and the
misfolded protein by high throughput screening. These small molecular inhibitors may
represent novel treatments for AD by attenuating the ER stress signals. We have
determined the complex crystal structure of PERK luminal domain and its peptide substrate,
which allows us to optimize the identified inhibitors by use of structure-based drug design.","ER stress is chronically activated in neurodegenerative diseases including

5U01DK120379-02,Development of an early diagnostic biomarker and novel treatment strategy for T1D,"Loss of insulin producing beta cells is a major problem of T1D and neither therapies that target this process nor simple measures/biomarkers that quantify it are currently available in humans. We recently discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as an attractive target in this regard, since genetic or pharmacological TXNIP downregulation with verapamil reduced beta cell apoptosis, increased pancreatic beta cell mass, and protected against and even reversed diabetes in mice. Now our, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial revealed that oral verapamil added for 12 months to a standard insulin regimen in adult subjects with recent onset T1D improved mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide area under the curve as a measure of endogenous beta cell function. While these findings have the advantage that they can be readily implemented into the clinic, they also underline the need for more specific tools to inhibit TXNIP. In fact, a novel, non-toxic, small molecule TXNIP inhibitor has now shown great promise in mouse models and human islets exposed to T1D-associated inflammatory cytokines. We further discovered that a specific TXNIP-induced microRNA is not only the most highly enriched microRNA in human beta cells, but is also released from dying beta cells, detectable in mouse and human serum, increased in T1D, and inversely correlated with remaining beta cell function. We therefore hypothesize that TXNIP inhibition provides a novel treatment strategy for T1D and that this serum microRNA represents an early diagnostic biomarker for T1D-associated beta cell loss in humans. To test this hypothesis we propose the following Specific Aims: #1: Study the effects of TXNIP inhibition as a novel treatment strategy for T1D including (i) test the effects of oral inhibitor administration on humanized mice using xenotransplantation of human islets into immunedeficient NRG-RIP-DTR mice to assess how TXNIP inhibition affects human islets in vivo in the context of diabetes and (ii) determine how the inhibitor functions and affects islet biology at a molecular level by elucidating the changes in gene expression and pathways involved using our reagents pertaining to TXNIP regulation and RNA sequencing of treated human islets. #2: Assess serum microRNA changes as an early diagnostic biomarker for T1D-associated beta cell loss. We will further explore our serum microRNA as a biomarker for T1D-associated beta cell loss during (i) disease progression as well as (ii) in response to verapamil-induced protection of beta cell function, taking advantage of our unique resource of pre-collected T1D serum samples from our clinical verapamil trial and (iii) will investigate the possibility that increased serum microRNA levels might predate the onset of T1D and could be used as an early marker for disease in at-risk subjects. Consistent with the goals of this HINR-CBDS RFA, the proposed studies will help develop a novel early T1D treatment strategy and a clinical diagnostic tool for the detection and staging of recently-diagnosed individuals with T1D.","Narrative

5R01DK078752-13,TXNIP REGULATION OF ENDOGENOUS BETA CELL MASS,"Diabetes is characterized by loss of pancreatic beta cell mass and over the course of this award we have established thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as a critical factor in this process. Recently, we found that TXNIP regulates beta cell microRNA expression and particularly induces beta cell expression of a specific, beta cell-enriched microRNA, miR-204 and thereby inhibits insulin production. Now, we discovered that miR-204 also directly targets the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP1R), revealing a novel link between microRNA and incretin signaling. The GLP1R is essential for incretin-mediated insulin secretion and control of glucose homeostasis as well as for the function of GLP-1-based diabetes therapies that have become widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, our preliminary data further demonstrate that miR-204 overexpression downregulates GLP1R in INS-1 beta cells and primary mouse as well as human islets. Moreover, miR-204 as well as TXNIP deletion in vivo in mice promoted islet GLP1R expression and GLP-1-induced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. In addition, miR-204 knockout (204KO) mice were found to retain a higher beta cell mass in the context of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Together with our extensive previous work on TXNIP and miR-204 and the well documented importance of GLP1R, these findings provide a strong scientific premise for the proposed studies. Our overall hypothesis is that inhibition of TXNIP-induced miR-204 enhances GLP1R expression and function as well as compensatory beta cell mass adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 Specific Aims: 1. Elucidate the effects of miR-204 and TXNIP on beta cell GLP1R, using our established miR-204 mimics and inhibitors and TXNIP overexpression system as well as INS-1 cells, human islets and type 2 diabetic human islets. 2. Determine how deletion of miR-204 and TXNIP affect GLP1R expression and function in vivo. By taking advantage of the availability of our novel miR-204 knockout (204KO) mice and our beta cell-specific TXNIP knockout (bTKO) mice we will assess GLP1R expression, responsiveness to GLP1R agonists, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, under normal conditions and in the context of high fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance and diabetes. 3. Study the mechanisms by which TXNIP-induced miR-204 regulates beta cell mass adaptation. We will investigate any potential differences in beta cell mass, apoptosis, proliferation and/or differentiation resulting from miR-204 deletion in the context of STZ-induced beta cell loss as well as HFD-induced insulin resistance and diabetes. The results of these studies will provide new knowledge in terms of the role TXNIP-induced miR-204 signaling plays in the control of beta cell GLP1R, insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis and beta cell mass adaptation and will shed new light onto the regulation of GLP1R, which currently serves as the target for a large number of diabetes drugs.","The results of the proposed studies will provide a better understanding of how a newly discovered regulatory mechanism controls pancreatic beta cell mass, function and insulin secretion by targeting a receptor that plays an important role in normal physiology as well as diabetes drug therapy.

5R01HL125279-03,Non-platelet P2Y Receptor in Vascular Inflammation and Thrombogenesis,"Thrombosis is a fatal complication of major diseases, such as stroke, sepsis, and heart attack. In addition to
aspirin, current medication for thrombosis prevention/treatment mainly focus on platelet P2Y12 receptor with
plavix as an antagonist in routine clinical use. However, plavix has showed unstable performance, either failing to
avoid thrombosis or causing bleeding. The long-term goal of this project is to establish non-platelet P2Y receptors,
e.g. P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), as a new molecular target that controls inflammation-induced vascular
thrombogenesis. Although it is well established that tissue factor (TF) is the initiator of thrombosis, very little is
known on the contribution of P2Y receptors in regulation of various inflammatory stimuli-induced TF expressions.
This is an important question because many pro-inflammatory stimuli promote cellular nucleotide release and
inactivate ectonucleotidases, leading to accumulation of extracellular nucleotides, which in turn amplify original
receptorsâ€™ signaling via P2Y receptor co-activation. The PI reported previously that P2Y2R is up-regulated in
stented coronary arteries and it is the predominant subtype of all P2Y receptors in human coronary artery
endothelial cells (HCAEC). They also reported that activation of P2Y2R dramatically induces TF expression and
activity in HCAEC. The PIsâ€™ preliminary studies showed that TF induction by P2Y2R is also applicable to human
primary blood monocytes and mouse coronary endothelium in vivo, and it involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms. Further, LPS-induced TF induction is significantly decreased when extracellular
nucleotides are removed by apyrase, and importantly, P2Y2R-null mice are protected from endotoxic death.
Based on these original findings, the PI proposes the hypothesis: The non-platelet P2Y2R is a previously
unrecognized key mediator in inflammation-induced thrombosis via TF induction. This hypothesis will be tested
by the pursuit of three specific aims: 1) Determine the transcriptional mechanism underlying P2Y2R activation of
the TF gene in vascular endothelial cells and blood monocytes; 2) Define the post-transcriptional mechanism by
which P2Y2R activation leads to increased TF mRNA stability in vascular endothelial cells and blood monocytes;
3) Assess the role of P2Y2R/TF axis in mouse models of inflammation-induced thrombosis. Aim 1 will determine
the role of a new AP-1 binding site with new AP-1 components Fra-1/ATF2 in TF mRNA induction by P2Y2R. Aim
2 will determine the roles of the AU-rich elements in TF 3â€™UTR along with their binding proteins and the miRNA
mechanisms contribute to P2Y2R-mediated TF mRNA stabilization. Aim 3 will verify if deletion of P2Y2R prevents
LPS-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation and reduces atherothrombosis. The proposed study will be
performed in primary cultured human cells and cells isolated from P2Y2R-null mice, followed by a series of in vivo
studies. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of
how inflammation leads to increased thrombogenicity of blood vessels via the new P2Y2R-TF axis. Ultimately,
such knowledge has the potential to produce new strategies in combating thrombogenic diseases.","P2Y2 receptor is an important protein that acts as a sensor for both extracellular ATP and UTP. The applicants
will investigate the functions of P2Y2 receptor in inflammation-induced blood clot formation. The results of the
proposed studies may provide the foundation for novel therapy for the treatment of blood vessel occlusive

1R21CA230475-01A1,Targeting metabolic checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment to boost efficacy of anti-CTLA-4,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anti-CTLA-4 was first immune checkpoint blockade therapy approved by the FDA to treat patients with cancer.
Notwithstanding its impressive clinical response in ~20% of patients with advanced melanoma, there is a clear
need to improve its efficacy. We recently showed that loss of IFN-ï§ signaling genes could partially explain why
the remaining ~80% patients are resistance to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic
targets/approaches capable of overcoming resistance and boosting efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 is of utmost
importance We and others previously demonstrated that the HIF1ï¡-glycolysis axis orchestrates an essential
â€œmetabolic checkpointâ€ in driving effector T cell differentiation and in suppressing regulatory T cell induction, two
functional outcomes closely associated with anti-CTLA-4 efficacy, suggesting activating HIF1ï¡ and glycolysis in
T cells could represent an effective approach to improve therapeutic efficacy of anti-CTLA-4. To this end, we
have generated interesting preliminary data showing that anti-CTLA-4 selectively upregulates HIF1ï¡ and its
downstream targets, glycolytic enzymes in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs). And, specific deletion of HIF1ï¡ in T
cells and simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis largely abolishes the therapeutic effects of anti-CTLA-4, pointing
to a critical role of HIF1ï¡ and glycolysis in this therapy. Therefore, we propose that HIF1ï¡, via modulating
glycolytic activity of TILs, dictates therapeutic efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, which can serve as novel therapeutic
targets to promote efficacy of anti-CTLA-4. In Aim 1, we will characterize how T cell-intrinsic HIF1ï¡ governs
glycolytic activity and effector functions of TILs in response to anti-CTLA-4. In Aim 2, we will target the HIF1ï¡-
glycolysis pathway to promote therapeutic efficacy of anti-CTLA-4. While it is well-known that anti-CTLA-4
markedly rejuvenates effector functions of TILs, the specific underlying mechanisms are largely unknown.
Insights gained from these studies will significantly advance our understanding of how anti-CTLA-4 metabolically
augments anti-tumor responses and manifest novel therapeutic opportunities (e.g., targeting metabolic
pathways) to improve efficacy of anti-CTLA-4.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

and disability, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. It is a priority to understand how
musculoskeletal phenotypes and physical activity change with age, the factors that contribute to these
changes, and how changes impact clinically important health outcomes. MrOS is a unique prospective study
of 5994 older men that has been extremely productive in expanding our understanding of age-related change
in musculoskeletal health. Initiated in 2000, it includes extensive longitudinal, objective, state-of-the-art
assessments of bone, muscle, physical performance, physical activity and health outcomes, as well as
biospecimen and imaging archives. We propose to extend these resources to allow a comprehensive and
integrated understanding of the processes and consequences of musculoskeletal aging and decline in physical
activity in older men studied over a 15 year period. The overall long term goal of the project is to identity men
at risk of adverse health outcomes who may benefit from preventive measures and rehabilitation, discover new
targets for treating and preventing declines in musculoskeletal health and activity, and improve our
understanding of optimal aging (men who maintain their musculoskeletal health and activity levels over an
average overall follow-up of 15 years). Specifically, we will leverage our repeated measurements to define age-
related trajectories in phenotypes of musculoskeletal health, physical performance, and physical activity in
order to determine factors that predict and contribute to these trajectories. We will test the hypotheses that
favorable trajectories in musculoskeletal health are associated with lower risks of incident falls, fractures,
disability and mortality and that age-related deterioration in bone, muscle and physical performance can occur
concurrently; combined deterioration magnifies the risk of poor functional and health outcomes. Second, we
will characterize change and trajectories in activity levels in older men using our repeated state-of-the-art
questionnaire and objectively assessed energy expenditure from accelerometry. Third, we will take advantage
of a linkage of MrOS with Medicare Claims data to determine the association of trajectories in musculoskeletal
phenotypes and activity with inpatient and nursing home related health care utilization. Fourth, we will examine
novel characteristics of cortical bone that may cause age-related skeletal fragility by using high resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography to measure cortical porosity. We will relate trajectories of
musculoskeletal health and activity to these measures of cortical bone and test whether increased cortical
porosity is related to fractures. Finally, we will continue to leverage MrOS as a platform for new science and
the training of investigators. Our application is consistent with the mission of the NIA and NIAMS to conduct
research related to the aging process and diseases and conditions associated with musculoskeletal aging, and
foster the development of new research scientists in this scientific area.","Decreases in bone, muscle, physical performance and physical activity occur with advancing age and can lead
to increased risk of fractures, falls, disability and death. These declines may also lead to substantial and

5K08GM109113-04,mtDNA DAMPS: a pharmacologic target in multi-organ system failure,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application for research training via the K08 mechanism originates from a trauma surgeon and critical care specialist that has been an assistant professor for three years. He now proposes a multi-dimensional training program intended to launch his academic career as a basic and translational surgeon-scientist and focused on one of the most pervasive problems in trauma and critical care medicine, specifically, multiple organ system failure (MOSF). The training program - physically located in the highly interdisciplinary and well-funded Center for Lung Biology and in the region's only level
1 Trauma Center - is intended to provide the candidate with (1) core knowledge and laboratory skills, (2) state-of-the-art expertise in research methods and biostatistics, and (3) scientific writing, presentation, and academic leadership skills. A combination of didactic courses, judicious attendance at on-site and off-site seminars and meetings, and intense laboratory experiences will be utilized to achieve these goals. The proposed research plan is motivated by two striking gaps in the care of patients with MOSF. First, although outcomes of severe injury have improved partly as a consequence of advances in resuscitation and supportive care, MOSF remains a serious clinical problem because pharmacologic strategies to prevent or reverse the syndrome have yet to be developed. Second, while mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction have long been incriminated in the response to severe injury, the prospect that key sentinel molecule(s) integrating cellular responses to systemic inflammation reside in these mitochondrial and bioenergetic abnormalities has not previously been considered. Accordingly, the candidate's research training plan will test the novel concept that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) acts as a molecular sentinel governing deleterious cell responses in MOSF. Multiple lines of evidence converge on this idea. The mitochondrial genome is far more sensitive to oxidative damage than nuclear DNA, an observation whose significance is underscored by involvement of reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen (RS) across the spectrum of MOSF. Further, modulation of mtDNA repair efficiency using transgenic strategies or novel platform drugs coordinately dictate survival and function in oxidant or bacteria-challenged cultured cells, isolated organs, and intact animals. Most provocatively, recent evidence incriminates mtDNA as an intercellular mediator of MOSF. Fragments of the mitochondrial genome released into the circulation after injury - termed mtDNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) - may serve to propagate damage from the initial site of injury to distant organs through TLR-mediated activation of inflammatory and resident cells (19). Because molecular determinants of mtDNA DAMP disposition are entirely unexplored, the proposed research will test the translationally-significant hypothesis that in severe trauma, oxidative base damage to the mitochondrial genome causes plasma accumulation of mtDNA DAMPs resulting in the evolution of MOSF. Studies in severely injured human patients, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in a rodent model of MOSF will: (1) Define relationships between plasma mtDNA DAMP levels and indices of MOSF in patients with severe trauma; (2) Test the hypothesis in human PBMCs that oxidant- mediated mtDNA damage and mtDNA repair kinetics are positively and negatively, respectively, associated with mtDNA DAMP release into the extracellular environment; and, (3) Determine if increased mtDNA repair and enhanced mtDNA DAMP degradation with novel platform drugs, prevents and reverses MOSF In a rat model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis. Collectively, this research will provide the first observational evidence linking plasma mtDNA DAMPs to the evolution of MOSF in a vulnerable population of severely injured patients. However, its most innovative and significant contributions relate to the identification of isolated targets for pharmacologic intervention in MOSF by providing proof-of-concept that strategies to augment mtDNA repair and accelerate mtDNA DAMP degradation suppress mtDNA DAMP accumulation and propagation of organ failure. It is believed that at the end of this training program, the candidate will be well positined to launch the first clinical trials on strategies to control mtDNA DAMP- mediated MOSF in severe injury. In addition, the candidate will inaugurate an independent laboratory research program whose goal will be define at a molecular level novel pharmacologic targets to govern mtDNA DAMP disposition in trauma and other disorders for which these inter- and intracellular mediators play pathogenic role.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Mitochondrial DNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (mtDNA DAMPs) released in response to tissue injury play an important pathologic role in the evolution of multi-organ system failure (MOSF).

underrepresented minority backgrounds to the concept of scientific research, the principles of scientific
experimentation, the proper methods of data analysis, the interpretation, presentation, and translational
applications of research results, and to clinicians who practice at academic medical centers. Each student will
work in the laboratory of a faculty mentor who has a proven track record in the mentoring of students and who
has an actively funded biomedical research program focusing on cardiovascular, pulmonary or sleep medicine
to accomplish this goal. In addition, all students will learn about careers in academic medical centers (AMCs)
by shadowing clinician-investigators during a typical day of clinical activities, leadership responsibilities,
teaching, and research. At the end of the first summer in the program, the students will write an abstract and
participate in both a local and national poster presentation of their research results. After the second summer
in the program, students will give a Powerpoint presentation to other students in the training program, and will
again present their research locally and nationally. The students will also receive instruction and advice from
program directors and near-peer mentors in essay writing, test preparation, and critical career development
skills. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide undergraduate students with an understanding and
appreciation of the biomedical research process so as to encourage them to pursue careers studying patients
and their diseases after further postgraduate training in graduate and medical education. This program was
initially funded by the NIH/NHLBI in 2014 and we have had 26 unique students participate in the past 4
summers. Those students were 62% AA, 35% Hispanic or Latino, 58% female, and 31% Disadvantaged. Of
the students who were eligible to return for a second PARAdiGM summer, 14/18 returned (78%). Of the
PARAdiGM trainees who have completed their undergraduate training, almost all have gone on to be accepted

5R01CA224306-02,A novel molecular cross-talk driving pancreatic cancer progression,"Tumor cells inevitably face hypoxia during the course of their progression and their adaptation to hypoxic
stress promotes invasive, metastatic and treatment-resistant phenotypes. Therefore, understanding the
molecular basis underlying adaptive responses to hypoxia and identification of involved molecular targets will
greatly facilitate the development of effective strategies for cancer management. We have recently provided
first experimental evidence for a pathobiological role of MYB in pancreatic cancer (PC). Our novel preliminary
findings now demonstrate i) role of MYB in hypoxic cell survival, ii), MYB-mediated regulation of HIF-1Î±, and iii)
MYB-HIF-1Î± interaction and co-localization. In other novel findings, we show differential binding of MYB to its
two target gene promoters under hypoxia. In addition, our novel data support the clinical significance of MYB
by showing its wide-spread expression in pancreatic tumor cases, which is also suggestive of its association
with increasing tumor-grade and patient's survival. Based on these compelling findings, we
hypothesize that MYB-HIF1Î± crosstalk plays an important role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis, which will be
tested in four specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the regulatory cross-talk between MYB and HIF-1Î± by
studying coordinated regulation of MYB and HIF-1Î± under hypoxia, and any reciprocity that may exist between
them. In aim 2,  we will define the role of interaction between MYB and HIF-1Î± in their transcriptional
reprogramming and hypoxia adaptive-response pathways. Specifically, we will examine if the MYB/HIF-1Î±
crosstalk alters their genomic occupancy leading to changes in transcriptome, and characterize hypoxia
adaptive-response phenotypes that are jointly or independently regulated by them. In aim 3, we will examine
the cooperative functional significance of MYB and HIF-1Î± in pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis by
using genetically-engineered, luciferase-tagged MYB- and HIF-1Î± expressing or knockout PC cells in an
orthotopic mouse model. Histological and immunohistochemical studies will be performed to measure changes
in tumor hypoxia, vasculature, cell proliferation/apoptosis, and metastasis. Finally, in aim 4, we will study the
clinical significance of MYB-HIF-1Î± cross-talk in PC by performing immunohistochemical analysis in human
pancreatic tumor samples along with adjacent and healthy normal pancreatic tissues to assess incidence,
intensity and co-expression of MYB and HIF-1Î±. We will also examine their correlation (alone and in
combination) with tumor -grade, -stage, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will deliver novel insight
into the functional and mechanistic significance of a novel molecular cross-talk (MYB/HIF-1Î±) in PC
pathobiology, and highlight its clinical significance. Resulting data would enhance our understanding of
molecular pathogenesis of PC and, thus, facilitate the development of novel approaches for its prevention and
treatment. Therefore, proposed studies have significant potential to impact pancreatic cancer research at
various levels that will ultimately support effective management of this devastating malignancy.","We have compelling data to support a pathobiological role of MYB/HIF-1Î± cross-talk in pancreatic cancer. Proposed research will generate additional convincing evidence at the functional, mechanistic and clinical levels to establish the significance of this novel molecular cross-talk in pancreatic cancer pathobiology, and thus improve our understanding of molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. In the longer term, the knowledge gained from the proposed research will enable the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies, and lead to better life expectancy and quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients.",2019,336158,221887,114271,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,366880002,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Human Genome; Pancreatic Cancer; Prevention; Rare Diseases,Ajay Pratap Singh
1I01HX001461-01A1,STorytelling to Improve DiseasE outcomes in GoUT: The STRIDE-GO Study,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Background and Objective: Low medication adherence in chronic diseases is a problem that costs over $100 billion a year in excess hospitalizations in the US. Patients often do not perceive disease severity and susceptibility to disease complications in chronic symptomatic diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), gout, etc., since severe disease symptoms are intermittent. Our objective is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, culturally relevant, narrative intervention, or ""storytelling"", basd on the solid conceptual foundation of the narrative communication theory and the Health Belief Model to improve medication adherence and outcomes in chronic diseases among African- American veterans, using gout as a test case. African-Americans (AAs) with gout have lower adherence to gout medications compared to Caucasians. Funded by the Veterans Affairs (VA) HSR&D pilot study program, we have completed the development and iterative modification of a powerful ""storytelling"" intervention consisting of messages from AA veterans with higher ULT adherence at Birmingham, AL and Philadelphia, PA. This final intervention has been tested for feasibility, acceptability, content and narrative strength in the target population at these sites and endorsed to be powerful by the target population. Project Objectives and Aims: Our long-term objective is to reduce health disparities in veterans and improve their health outcomes. The objective of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy of a novel storytelling intervention in veterans' own voices to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in African- American veterans with gout. Our Specific Aim (SA)s are to assess the efficacy of storytelling intervention in African-American veterans with gout for improving: SA1: Improving ULT adherence, directly measured by using MEMS (Medication Event Monitoring System) Caps at 3, 6 and 9 months (assess intervention's effect) and 12 months (assess durability of effect), SA2: Improving Gout flare rate, patient satisfaction and target serum urate (sUA) <6 mg/dl achievement, as indirect measures of better ULT adherence and important gout outcomes. Project Methods: We will conduct a 12-month, multicenter, randomized controlled trial among 250 African- American veterans with gout with ULT medication possession ratio of <80% at Birmingham, St. Louis and Philadelphia VA clinics. We will compare the efficacy of the storytelling intervention to usual care in improving ULT adherence, assessed with MEMSCaps (electronic monitoring) at 6-months (primary outcome); reducing gout flares needing treatment, improving patient satisfaction, improving the ability to achieve target serum urate <6 mg/dl and improving self-reported ULT adherence at 6-months (secondary outcomes). We will assess these outcomes at 12-months as evidence for sustenance of the effect of intervention. Alignment with VA mission and priorities: This study serves the VA's mission of improving the health of veterans and addresses two priority areas, 1) decreasing health care disparities and 2) improving health care delivery using a low-cost, technology-based solution to poor medication adherence. Study results will lead to a ready-to-implement low cost patient-centered intervention for AA veterans with gout to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes. Our study will provide the proof of efficacy of ""storytelling"" for improving medication adherence in chronic symptomatic diseases. The ""storytelling"" intervention can be easily adapted for similar chronic symptomatic conditions such as COPD and CHF.   
      

","Health disparities are common, and disease outcomes in African-American (AA) veterans with chronic
conditions are worse than Caucasian veterans. Medication adherence is low in chronic diseases. Low
medication adherence leads to excess healthcare utilization, cost and poor outcomes. We have developed and
pilot-tested a novel â€œstorytellingâ€ intervention, which consists of powerful, personal messages from AA
veteransâ€™ in their voices regarding medication adherence challenges and solutions as a video â€œstoryâ€, in target
audience of other AA veterans with low medication adherence. We are using gout, the most common and very
painful, inflammatory arthritis in veterans, as a model of chronic symptomatic disease with intermittent flares. In
this 12-month randomized study at clinics at 3 VA hospitals, we will test whether â€œstorytellingâ€ is better than
regular care in improving gout medication adherence (primary outcome); and reducing gout flare rate and
improving patient satisfaction and achievement of target serum urate <6 mg/dl in 250 AA veterans with gout.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,Jasvinder A Singh
5P50AR060772-08,Project 4: Protecting Renal functiOn with Urate-lowering Drugs (PROUD),"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The management of gout is suboptimal and complicated by high prevalence of comorbidities, including chronic 
kidney disease (CKD); 71% of gout patients in U.S. have CKD stage 2 or higher. A key reason for 
suboptimal gout care is lack of knowledge and acceptance for the utility of lowering serum urate (sUA) levels to 
< 6 mg/dl (based on the solubility threshold of 6.8 mg/dl), known as treat-to-target (TTT). While a sUA 
threshold of < 6 mg/dl is valuable for managing gout, it has not been examined for renal function preservation. 
Recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funded a 4-year randomized, double-blinded, non-inferiority 
â€œStop Goutâ€ (VA CSP594) study with a sUA TTT approach, which will assess the comparative effectiveness of 
allopurinol vs. febuxostat. Our proposed study, Protecting Renal functiOn with Urate-lowering Drugs (PROUD), 
a mechanistic ancillary study to this innovative trial, will leverage trial data to assess whether achieving target 
sUA is valuable for renal function preservation for the first time, with the following two specific aims. 
Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of sUA lowering and allopurinol and febuxostat dose in 
preserving renal function in gout patients. We hypothesize that each of the following factors will be 
positively associated with renal function preservation as assessed by change in eGFR based on serum 
creatinine at 72-weeks (primary outcome) and serum Cystatin C at 48-weeks (secondary outcome): Achieving 
a sUA reduction and a target sUA level < 6 mg/dl at 24-weeks (Hypotheses 1a and 1b), baseline CKD Stage 3 
(compared to CKD stage 1 or 2; Hypothesis 1c), the final up-titrated allopurinol dose at 21-weeks (Hypothesis 
1d), and the final up-titrated febuxostat dose at 18-weeks (Hypothesis 1e). Specific Aim 2 will assess the 
mechanisms of renal function preservation in gout. We hypothesize that reduction at 24-weeks in each of 
the following will be associated with renal function preservation at 72-weeks: Renin-angiotensin system 
activation (plasma renin and aldosterone; Hypothesis 2a), systemic inflammation (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, MCP-1, 
PDGF, C-reactive protein; Hypothesis 2b), and oxidative stress level (lipid peroxidation by 8-epi-PGF2a; 
protein oxidation by carbonyl formation, 3-nitrotyrosine formation and reduced thiol status; Hypothesis 2c). 
PROUD will have high public health impact and will advance the field by addressing unanswered questions 
related to renal function preservation with XOI in gout and underlying mechanisms. The University of Alabama 
at Birmingham (UAB) and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), two large academic gout and 
immunology research centers, are ideally positioned to address the clinical and mechanistic questions posed.

5R01CA204430-04,Mitochondria in Prostate Cancer Diversity,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role in normal development of the prostate gland, in prostate carcinogenesis, and in the progression of prostate cancer to advanced metastatic disease. Traditional thinking is that AR localizes exclusively to the nucleus and that nuclear AR regulates genes that are essential to prostate cancer development. This is true. However, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of AR in mitochondria. We have discovered that AR 1) directly localizes into the mitochondria and 2) indirectly transcriptionally regulates nuclear genes whose products localize into mitochondria and perform mitochondrial functions. Our studies reveal that i) AR localizes into mitochondria in primary prostate tissues and cell lines, ii) AR is imported into isolated mitochondria, and iii) AR contains a mitochondrial localization signal (MLS) capable of targeting foreign proteins, such as green fluorescent protein, into mitochondria. Indirectly, AR controls expression of a variety of nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) subunits, including NDUFB8 (Complex I), SDHB (Complex II), UQCRC2 (Complex III), COXII subunit (Complex IV), and ATP5A (Complex V). AR also down-regulates the TFAM, GFM1, and GFM2 genes, which control mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. Consistent with this, the mtDNA content and the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX II protein is significantly reduced in PC3-AR prostate cells expressing AR. Notably, we demonstrate that the mtDNA content in prostate tumors of African-Americans (AA) is >6 times less than in tumors of Caucasian-Americans (CA). mtDNA content was also lower in normal prostates of AA than CA. To identify the underlying mitochondrial basis of prostate cancer diversity, we conducted comprehensive, race-based bioinformatics analyses of variants in more than 6000 AA and 33,000 CA and discovered, in the AR gene of AA, missense variants located in two domains: the N-terminal domain containing the MLS and the DNA-binding domain. Of note, missense mutations in CA were found only in the hinge domain containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of AR. Expression of AR variant S598G in PC3 cells reduced more than the wild type the expression of TFAM, which controls mtDNA content. We hypothesize that AR missense variants/mutants present, solely in AA, contribute to the ""gain"" or ""loss"" of mitochondrial function and thereby to prostate cancer diversity in AA. AIM 1: Determine the prognostic significance of AR missense variants/mutants and mtDNA content on prostate cancer metastasis and reoccurrence in AA and CA. AIM 2: Evaluate the significance of mitochondrial AR missense variants/mutants as direct regulators of mitochondrial functions that affect composition, organization, stability, and activity of mtOXPHOS super-complexes and apoptosis. AIM 3: Evaluate the significance of nuclear AR missense variants/mutants as indirect regulators of mitochondrial function. AIM 4: Use mouse xenograft model to establish the significance of mitochondrial and nuclear AA- and CA-specific AR missense variants/mutants on prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our proposed study will characterize a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial mechanism regulated by androgen receptor underlying the prostate cancer aggressiveness in AA men.,2019,326174,221887,104287,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Genetics; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases,KESHAV K SINGH
1R01CA231925-01A1,Impact of social factors on breast cancer biology in African-American women,"ABSTRACT
African American (AA) women are more likely to be diagnosed at an early age with breast cancer (BC), have
aggressive disease and experience greater mortality, compared to their Caucasian American (CA) counterparts.
Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress have long been believed to be the prime cause of such health
disparities; however, it is not yet well understood how these social factors are translated into increased cancer
risk, aggressive tumor-subtypes, and poor clinical outcomes. Demographic data suggest that AA women
encounter more socioeconomic difficulties than CA women and social stressors impact human biology through
epigenomic modifications of gene functions. MicroRNAs, which are important epigenetic modulators of gene
expression and key players in human biology and disease, are known to be regulated by stress
hormones/cytokines and exhibit differential expression in socially disadvantaged population. Along these lines,
our published and preliminary studies have identified increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and
stress hormones (resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), and certain microRNAs (miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a) in
AA women (with or without BC). We have also observed that treatment of BC cells and macrophages with
resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol leads to an upregulation of miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a, promotes growth
and malignant behavior of BC cells, and induces M2 polarization of macrophages. These compelling findings
build a strong scientific premise for this project and support our hypothesis that socioeconomic hardships
promote chronic inflammation and stress leading to altered serum levels of hormones and cytokines (such as
resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), which in turn, modulate the expression of immune-suppressive and tumor-
promoting miRNAs, eventually contributing to BC pathogenesis. In four specific aims, we propose to determine
global changes in circulating microRNAs in serum of AA and CA women (with or without BC) and establish their
correlation with SES (low/moderate/high) (Aim 1); analyze levels of resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol in serum,
and study their association with SES and serum miRNAs (Aim 2); examine regulation of miRNAs by resistin, IL6,
leptin, and cortisol and delineate the underlying mechanisms (Aim 3); and establish the pathobiological
significance of differentially-expressed miRNAs (Aim 4). Together, these studies will establish the functional
association between socioeconomic health determinants and breast tumor biology, and support the role of
miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers that link the social stress to biological phenotypes.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Socioeconomic factors are suggested to affect gene function and thereby influence health trajectories or modify
disease risk in the racial/ethnic minority and health disparity populations. The proposed research will characterize
global changes in serum microRNAs (epigenomic regulators of gene expression) of African American women,
establish their correlative association with socioeconomic status and physiological stress caused by social
hardships, and generate experimental support for these associations at the mechanistic and functional levels.
Resulting data is expected to support the role of miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers linking social stress to

5R01CA204801-04,Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and
identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.",2019,336158,221887,114271,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS,366880002,Biotechnology; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Genetics,Seema  Singh
2R25GM106995-06A1,RISE Option II:NIGMS-Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) Program at ASU,"Summary
Alabama State University (ASU) is renewing its NIGMS-RISE program. The major objective of the program is
to increase the number of underrepresented minority students (URM) enrolling in PhD programs in biomedical
sciences. This renewal is significant, since the NIGMS-RISE program is the only program at ASU that provides
research training and PhD preparedness students in the MS program in biology with the highest potential of
entering PhD programs. With this rationale, our NIGMS-RISE program provides rigorous graduate curricula
emphasizing analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, mathematical skills, intense research training,
scientific writing and skills building through technical workshops and other extracurricular activities. All RISE
students are required to participate in summer research working with a research mentor at participating
research-intensive institutions. A team of 16 committed faculty mentors at ASU provides research training to
RISE students leading into a MS thesis. The research training is complemented with mentoring by 15 external
collaborators resulting in transition of ASU MS graduates into PhD programs at research-intensive institutions.
The second cycle will support five (5) MS students at ASU each year for a maximum support of two years. The
two specific aims with measureable objectives are:
Specific Aim #1: Enhance PhD preparedness of RISE participants through curricular and extracurricular
activities. Objectives are: 1) All RISE participants will participate in all RISE curricular and professional
activities, 2) All RISE participants will improve their GPA by 15%, 3) 100% of RISE participants will show
improvement in their writing skills, and 4) 100% participants will improve on their GRE scores by 10%.
Specific Aim #2: Provide rigorous research training to RISE students to complete the MS degree and ensure
their acceptance into PhD programs in biomedical sciences. Objectives are: 1) 100% of participants will
complete the MS degree within two years, 2) 100% of RISE participants will participate in summer research at
an external collaborator institution and all RISE sponsored curricular and professional activities, 3) Over 80%
of participants (4 out of 5) will be accepted in PhD programs in the biomedical sciences by the end of year 2 of
the MS program, and 4) 100% of participants will author one peer-reviewed publication.
We anticipate that through the NIGMS-RISE program, 12 African-American students will transition to PhD
programs in biomedical sciences.","Project Narrative:

1R43CA232844-01A1,Development of Inhibitors of cANGPTL4 for Pancreatic Cancer Therapeutics,"This project seeks to develop inhibitors of a novel pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) protein target.
PDAC remains one of the deadliest cancers with an average survival of 3.5 months for non-resectable tumors.
Currently, a major obstacle in PDAC treatment is that the cells rapidly exhibit resistance to existing untargeted
treatment regimens leaving patients with no further options. Studies indicate that inhibiting this novel protein
target will be effective against the most severe forms of PDAC. Aim 1 of this project will expand and refine the
inhibitor chemotype using computational and experimental binding measurements. Aim 2 will experimentally
validate the hits from Aim 1 and assess specificity and mechanism of action of hit compounds in vitro. Finally,
preliminary ADME will be assessed on the top hits. During Phase II, these data will drive medicinal chemistry
design and synthesis of a lead series. Followed by in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy producing a
validated and targeted PDAC therapeutic lead compound for further pre-clinical studies.","The goal of this project is to further develop a novel, targeted pancreatic cancer therapeutic. The results of this
study will refine and validate potential therapeutic compounds with desirable effects against pancreatic cancer
cells. Future efforts including animal studies could lead to desperately needed treatment options for pancreatic

5R01AR071189-03,Significance of metabolic activation of lumisterol in the skin,"UVB breaks the B-ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol leading to the formation of pre-vitamin D3 that either undergoes
thermal isomerization to D3 or photoisomerization to lumisterol (L3) in a 9Î²,10Î±-configuration. L3 is the major
photoisomer formed after prolonged exposure of the skin to UVB energy, in a process that is irreversible. L3
has been considered to be metabolically and biologically inactive with its formation explaining why UVB
induced cutaneous production of pre-D3 does not lead to systemic intoxication by D3. Recently we found that
L3 is metabolized by CYP11A1 to 22(OH)L3, 24(OH)L3, 20,22(OH)2D3 and pregnalumisterol (pL) [collectively
called (OH)nL3]. Uning LC/qTOF-MS we demonstrated the presence of L3 in human serum at levels higher
than D3, and detectable levels of (OH)nL3 in the epidermis and serum. Furthermore, we found that (OH)nL3
inhibits the proliferation of human epidermal keratinocytes and that 20(OH)L3 stimulates the expression of
genes associated with keratinocyte differentiation and protection against oxidative stress. Our preliminary
molecular modeling predicts that the major (OH)nL3 products can act on RORÎ± and RORÎ³ showing favorable
docking scores in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptors, similar to known natural ligands.
Supporting these predictions we found that 20(OH)L3 inhibits RORÎ³ and RORÎ± transactivation activities in a
Tet-on CHO cell reporter system, as well as reducing (RORE)-LUC reporter activity in skin cells. Thus, we
have discovered a new lumisterogenic biochemical pathway that is biologically relevant. To investigate its role
in skin physiology and pathology we formulate the hypothesis that skin-derived L3 is enzymatically activated
generating (OH)nL3 compounds which regulate epidermal barrier and photoprotective functions through
interaction with RORÎ± and RORÎ³. This hypothesis will be tested via three aims. 1. Defining RORÎ± and RORÎ³
as functional receptors for novel hydroxylumisterol derivatives ((OH)nL3); 2. Defining the phenotypic activities
of (OH)nL3 in cultured epidermal keratinocytes and in human skin histocultured ex vivo; 3. Defining the relative
roles of RORÎ± and RORÎ³ in (OH)nL3-mediated regulation of the differentiation program and protective
mechanisms against UVB radiation in the epidermis. Our highly mechanistic strategy combines techniques of
primary epidermal and organ cultures, in silico methods, cell-based transcriptional studies coupled to the LBD
of RORÎ±/Î³, the use of genetically modified cells, whole genome RNA sequencing with bioinformatics, and the
techniques of biochemistry, chemistry and molecular biology. This proposal is a comprehensive, multi-
disciplinary and state-of-the-art investigation. Its significance encompasses defining a role for a previously
unrecognized pathway of activation of an important UV photoproduct, L3, in skin physiology and pathology.
The practical outcome of the realization of aims 1-3 would be the use of the most potent (OH)nL3 as agent(s)
that either enhance the epidermal barrier or prevent or reverse damage inflicted by noxious stressors and
UVB. Establishing roles for RORs in these processes will define them as druggable pharmacological targets.","Following the surprising discovery that lumisterol, previously believed to be metabolically inactive, is
transformed by CYP11A1 to biologically active hydroxy-derivatives which are detectable in the human serum
and epidermis, we will define functions of these products in the skin using a highly mechanistic approach. This
will include investigation on the mechanism of action of the derivatives, focusing on RORÎ± and Î³ signaling. We
will define their roles in the keratinocyte differentiation program and test them as protectors of genomic and
cellular integrity in the epidermis against UVB, the UVR spectrum responsible for the production of lumisterol.",2019,328460,221760,106700,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Genetics; Human Genome,ANDRZEJ T SLOMINSKI
1I01BX004293-01A1,CYP11A1-derived secosteroids as therapeutic agents in UVB induced skin cancer,"Military personnel are unavoidably exposed to high doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) during
training or exercise, or when deployed to locations with high solar radiation. Therefore, our
veterans are particularly vulnerable to a lifetime development of skin cancers such as squamous
and basal cell carcinomas, because of an excessive exposure to UVR that is inevitable due to the
requirements and nature of military service. UVB is also required for vitamin D3 (D3) production
in the skin, which supplies >90% of the bodyâ€™s requirement for this prohormone. Due to the toxic
(calcemic) effects, therapeutic uses of 1,25(OH)2D3 at pharmacological doses are severely
limited. We discovered an alternative pathway that starts by the action of CYP11A1, rate limiting
enzyme of steroidogenesis, to produce 20(OH)D3 with its further hydroxylation producing several
(OH)nD3 metabolites. All of them express biological activities that are affected by cell lineage and
position of hydroxyl group. 20(OH)D3 and its metabolites are present in the epidermis, adrenals
and in human serum with majority of other metabolites also detectable in vivo. These secosteroids
demonstrate biological potency equal or higher than that of 1,25(OH)2D3. Some of them are
noncalcemic/nontoxic at supra-pharmacological doses. They induce keratinocyte differentiation,
and initial experiments indicate that they have radio-protective and anti-skin cancer properties.
Therefore, our hypothesis is that novel CYP11A1-derived vitamin D hydroxyderivatives can
prevent and reverse UVB induced skin cancerogenesis and act as anti-cancer compounds. The
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: We will define the preclinical efficacy
of CYP11A1-derived D3-hydroxyderivatives and determine their mechanism of action against
UVB-induced epidermal skin cancers. In its Subaim 1 we will define the relative efficacy of
20(OH)D3 and its downstream (OH)nD3 metabolites against immortalized or malignant human
and murine epidermal keratinocytes. In its Subaim 2 we will define the mechanism of action of
selected (OH)nD3 derivatives. Specific Aim 2: We will test preclinical efficacy of 20(OH)D3 and
the two most potent (OH)nD3 derivatives against UVB-induced cancer in the Ptch+/-/SKH-1
murine model. The expected outcome is to provide the proof that selected CYP11A1-derived
secosteroids can attenuate or reverse UVB induced pathology acting as â€œguardiansâ€ against
photocarcinogenesis. We will also define the mechanism of action for its anti-cancerogenic effects
and establish similarities and differences for topical application prior to or after UV exposure. The
final goal is to use topically or intra-muscularly optimal noncalcemic secosteroids to protect or
treat current and future military personnel against UVB induced skin cancer before it is too late.","Military personnel is unavoidably exposed to high doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) during
training or exercise at locations with high solar radiation. This leads to skin aging, precancerous
states, and skin cancers. UVB is also necessary for production of vitamin D3, of which active form
is calcemic 1,25(OH)2D3. We have defined an alternative pathway of D3 activation by CYP11A1
that generates noncalcemic forms including 20(OH)D3. We propose to test whether 20(OH)D3
and its downstream hydroxymetabolites will protect skin from UVB induced cancer, while being
nontoxic. We will also define mechanism of action for radioprotective effects of novel
secosteroids. We expect to provide an evidence for use of noncalcemic secosteroids to protect
current and future military personnel against UVB induced cancers before it is too late.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,ANDRZEJ T SLOMINSKI
5R01AR073004-02,Mechanism of action and function of novel secosteroid 20(OH)D3 in the skin,"Ultraviolet B both damages the skin and is required for photochemical transformation of 7-dehydrocholesterol
to vitamin D3 (D3). Its sequential hydroxylation at C25 and C1 generates biologically active 1,25(OH)2D3 that
displays a variety of pleiotropic activities. It was believed that all of these effects are mediated by single
molecule, 1,25(OH)2D3, and single receptor, VDR. Discovery of an alternative pathway in which CYP11A1
oxidizes the side chain of D3 producing 20(OH)D3 with its further metabolism to other downstream-derivatives,
(OH)nD3, challenged this dogma. 20(OH)D3 is detectable in the human epidermis at concentration higher than
25(OH)D3, and in human serum at ~3nM. 20(OH)D3 shows biological activities suggestive that it can act as an
endogenous regulator of epidermal barrier, while its presence in circulation suggests hormonal functions.
20(OH)D3 is noncalcemic at pharmacological doses (30-60Âµg/kg). Initial data and computer modeling indicate
that it can act as biased agonist on VDR and reverse agonist on RORÎ± and RORÎ³. Hypothesis: 20(OH)D3
and/or its metabolites acting directly on VDR and/or RORÎ± and RORÎ³ stimulate keratinocyte differentiation
program and photoprotective and repair mechanisms that protect epidermis against UVB-induced pathology.
These effects would not require its hydroxylation in position C1Î±, in contrast to 1,25(OH)2D3. The hypothesis
will be tested as follows: Aim 1. To test the relative role of VDR, RORÎ±, or RORÎ³ in 20(OH)D3 mediated
regulation of the proliferation and differentiation programs in epidermal keratinocytes. Subaim 1: Through in
vitro binding to the ligand-binding domain of recombinant VDR and RORs we will define relative interactions of
20(OH)D3 and its downstream metabolites with the receptors in comparison to their native ligands. Then we
will apply complex cell-based models to measure ligands modulated transcriptional activities. These will be
supplemented by molecular modeling analyses. Subaim 2: The relative roles of VDR and RORs in regulation
of keratinocytes proliferation and differentiation will be tested using gene silencing technology. This will be
complemented by tests on keratinocytes isolated from VDR-/-, RORÎ±-/- or RORÎ³-/- mice. Subaim 3: RNA-Seq
for gene expression and ChIP-Seq for receptor enrichment on target genes followed by bioinformatics
analyses to identify alternative targets. Aim 2. To define protective role of 20(OH)D3 against UVB radiation in
the human epidermis. Subaim 1: Testing the role of 20(OH)D3 as a survival factor. Subaim 2: Testing whether
20(OH)D3 attenuates UVB induced apoptosis. Subaim 3: Testing whether 20(OH)D3 can act as an
antigenotoxic/antimutagenic agent. Subaim 4: Testing the role of RORÎ± or RORÎ³ in skin responses to the
UVB using mice with genotype -/-,-/+ and +/+ for these receptors and comparing with mice with defective or intact
VDR. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the phenotypic effects of 20(OH)D3 and its metabolites require 1Î±
hydroxylation as described for 1,25(OH)2D3. We will use cells with silenced CYP27B1 gene. This will be
complemented by pharmacological inhibition of the CYP27B1 activity in keratinocytes.","Following discovery of new pathway of vitamin D3 activation by CYP11A1, of which 20(OH)D3 is the main
intermediate and precursor to majority of (OH)nD3 metabolites, we will define mechanism of action of
20(OH)D3 in epidermal keratinocytes. The activity of this non-calcemic analog will be compared to classical
1,25(OH)2D3 and other downstream-metabolites, if applicable, and their functions on vitamin D and retinoic
orphan acid receptors Î± and Î³ will be defined. Their roles in protecting epidermis against ultraviolet B radiation

1R61AG065619-01,Enhancing Sleep Quality for Nursing Home Residents with Dementia:  Pragmatic Trial of an Evidence-Based Frontline Huddling Program,"Disturbed sleep places older adults at higher risk for frailty, morbidity, and even mortality. Yet nursing home
(NH) routines frequently disturb residentsâ€™ sleep through use of noise and light or efforts, for example, to
reduce incontinence. NH residents with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or related dementias (ADRD)â€”almost two-thirds
of long-stay NH residentsâ€”are likely to be particularly affected by sleep disturbance. This study tackles these
important issues and substantially moves forward goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
2018 Update by proposing to implement an evidence-based intervention to improve sleep: a NH frontline staff
huddling program known as LOCK. The LOCK program is derived from evidence supporting strengths-based
learning, systematic observation, relationship-based teamwork, and efficiency. A LOCK program pilot targeting
staff-resident interactions enabled 6 Veterans Health Administration (VA) NHs make meaningful quantitative
and qualitative improvements. Preliminary qualitative data from a national VA roll out show that the program is
effective when targeting resident clinical outcomes such as pain and pressure ulcers. The programâ€™s methods
have also improved clinical care in non-VA NHs. This proposal is therefore an NIH Stage III, real world hybrid
efficacy-effectiveness pragmatic trial of the LOCK program for sleep (LOCK sleep program). In non-VA NHs
from 3 NH corporations, the study will (1) refine the LOCK program to focus on sleep for residents with ADRD
in an R61 phase, (2) test the impact of the LOCK sleep program for NH residents with ADRD in an R33 phase,
and (3) evaluate the programâ€™s sustainability. The R61 phase (1 year; n = 3 NHs; 1 NH per corporation) has
the following specific aims: (1) Refine the LOCK sleep program train-the-trainer protocol by implementing
and pilot-testing it. (2) Refine the research methods to effectively identify eligible NHs and residents, obtain
consent, collect primary data from residents and staff, explore staff impressions of additional sleep
measurement devices (Fitbits), transfer primary and secondary data to our data center, and merge all data.
After successfully completing designated R61 milestones and refining the intervention methods, we will
conduct a wedge-design randomized, controlled trial. The R33 phase (4 years; n = 24 NHs; 8 NHs per
corporation) has the following specific aims: (1) Implement the LOCK-based sleep program for residents
with ADRD using the train-the-trainer model. (2) Estimate impact of the LOCK sleep program on sleep (primary
outcome) and on psychotropic medication use, pain and analgesic medication use, and activities of daily living
decline (secondary outcomes). (3) Examine factors, using mixed methods, associated with variation in the
programâ€™s implementation and its sustainability. This innovative program also has future potential to address
other important issues (safety, infection control) and expand to other settings (assisted living, inpatient mental
health). The studyâ€™s strong team, careful consideration of design challenges, and resulting rigorous, pragmatic
approach will ensure success of this promising intervention for NH residents with ADRD.","This study will improve clinical outcomes for an important, growing, and vulnerable populationâ€”

5R01CA148629-09,Novel approaches to enhance tumor cell cytotoxicity of alkylating agents,"Project Summary / Abstract
DNA repair pathways maintain the integrity of the genome and help prevent the onset of cancer. Conversely, DNA
repair deficiencies engender tumor heterogeneity and promote the selection of highly aggressive subtypes (i.e.,
`mutator' phenotype). Importantly, DNA repair proteins have emerged as potential synthetic lethal targets for
improving the selective response to currently available anti-cancer regimens. Key to advancing such a strategy is
a detailed mechanistic understanding of the select DNA repair pathway in question, an appreciation of repair
pathway redundancy & crosstalk and a molecular characterization of processes that regulate the function and
stability of the proteins essential for repair. This completely revised R01 proposal builds on our recent discovery
that PolÃŸ is ubiquitylated on lysines 206/244 in a manner that is dependent on the cell cycle and the type of DNA
damage. Further, we reported that (i) PolÃŸ ubiquitylation may govern pathway crosstalk, (ii) select oxidized DNA
lesions require/promote PolÃŸ degradation and (iii) PolÃŸ-mediated BER facilitates DNA repair pathway crosstalk
that may be regulated by steady-state levels of PolÃŸ protein. Therefore, our first task was to identify the E3
ligases and de-ubiquitylation enzymes (DUBs) that may regulate PolÃŸ. High-resolution mass spectrometry
proteomic analysis of PolÃŸ-interacting proteins and in response to PARP-activation allowed us to identify several
E3 ligases and DUBs likely to target PolÃŸ to regulate stability and function. Our new data supports a role for the
E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 contributing to the regulation of PolÃŸ stability and governing PolÃŸ chromatin retention.
Further, PolÃŸ ubiquitylation appears to govern BER repair complex dynamics. Most importantly, our preliminary
data suggests that ubiquitylation facilitates trafficking of PolÃŸ to participate in late-phase replication associated
repair (RAR) foci in response to complex DNA lesions. These RAR foci are XRCC1 dependent but devoid of DSB
markers such as Î³H2AX or 53BP1. The Aims detailed in the proposal will use purified proteins, cancer cell lines,
tumor stem cells, high-resolution proteomics, live-cell fluorescent imaging and mouse xenografts to address our
hypothesis that ubiquitylation/de-ubiquitylation regulates PolÃŸ stability, PolÃŸ-dependent BER repair complex
dynamics and facilitates a coordinated trafficking mechanism to promote PolÃŸ involvement yet suppress 53BP1
involvement at complex lesions following alkylation, cisplatin and radiation damage.","Project Narrative

5U01ES029518-02,Measuring genomic DNA damage and DNA repair capacity in longitudinal population samples - a step towards precision prevention,"Project Summary
Advanced technologies for characterizing human populations at the molecular level have set the stage for
personalized therapeutic strategies that may also provide an opportunity for personalized prevention.
Personalized or â€˜Precision Preventionâ€™ would therefore provide an opportunity to identify those at high risk for a
given disease, in part based on defined functional defects (such as a defect in genome maintenance), so as to
advise for targeted screening and primary prevention interventions early in life to alter disease susceptibility. DNA
repair pathways maintain the integrity of the genome and thereby help prevent the onset of cancer, disease and
aging phenotypes and play a significant role in the cellular and organismal response to environmental exposures.
In the vein of precision prevention, identifying those with functional defects in the maintenance of genome integrity
would be a first step as such â€˜carriersâ€™ would have an increased risk of exposure-associated pathologies. Many of
these cancer- or disease-specific DNA repair defects can be detected using current ""omics"" technologies such as
evaluating changes in mRNA expression, alterations in the DNA coding sequence or modulations in cellular
metabolites such as NAD+ metabolites known to regulate mitochondrial function and regulate DNA repair
pathways, as we have shown. However, there are many defects that can only be detected from a direct analysis
of basal genome integrity and a direct measure of the cellular capacity to repair the genome in response to
exogenous genotoxins. In response to RFA-ES-17-006: Expanding Genome Integrity Assays to Population
Studies, we propose Aims that will advance our capacity to examine human populations for genome damage and
genome repair capacity, illuminating variations between individuals at discrete time-points as well as within
individuals across a five-year period. Genome integrity and DNA repair capacity in sentinel PBMCs at basal level
and following challenge by environmental genotoxins will be evaluated using a newly developed next-generation
high-throughput DNA damage detection platform. The advances of this new platform have now opened the door
for the analysis of large-scale population cohorts, providing a huge step forward in human biomonitoring
opportunities. These studies will provide the first look at a longitudinal measure of genome integrity in a
community-based cohort of mostly African American descent and will advance our capacity to interrogate human
populations for genome damage and genome repair capacity.","Project Narrative

 Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of motile cilia that results in
progressive lung disease due to abrogated mucociliary clearance. While new understandings of the genetics
have been helpful for clinical diagnostics, functional testing of cilia are needed to understand and predict
phenotypic variation and response to therapy. Recent work in our laboratory has identified a link between
ciliary genetics and novel ciliary phenotypes using one-micron optical coherence tomography (ÂµOCT). We
have phenotyped the ciliary beating pattern of known and novel murine PCD models. We have extended this
work to humans through the use of human nasal epithelial cells. Using these technologies, we will
characterize and quantify functional ciliopathies My overall hypothesis is that PCD mutations can be
functionally analyzed to diagnose PCD, understand genotype-phenotype correlation on a mechanistic level,
and predict clinical response to ciliary agonists. The goals of this proposal are 1) to advance Î¼OCT and other
functional imaging analysis to diagnose and categorize the functional consequences of PCD-associated gene
defects on Mucociliary transport in primary human cells and 2) determine whether pharmacological modulation
of ciliary function can augment ciliary motility and mucus clearance in mutants with motile cilia expression
through the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the diagnostic accuracy of ÂµOCT-based functional analysis of primary
human airway cells.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the relationship between genotype and functional ciliary phenotype in
PCD. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether pharmacologic modulation of CBF can rescue MCT in PCD
with motile cilia expression.
 This project explores new concepts in the pathobiology of primary ciliary dyskinesia through the
innovative use of in vitro imaging (ÂµOCT) measures of mucociliary transport and ciliary motion to diagnose and
precisely phenotype clinical PCD and the effect of genetics on ciliary function and MCT in human tissues. In
so doing, we will establish a protocol for testing of treatments to augment MCT and ciliary function. The
accompanying career development plan and the research aims as outlined above are of equal importance in
the development of this project. Combined with a strong mentoring committee, additional training in genetics
and cardiopulmonary physiology, study design, methodology, and statistical analysis, Dr. Solomon will have all
the tools to achieve his career goal as an independent physician-scientist. The opportunities created by this
career development award will result in the creation of a physician-scientist with the skills necessary to

1F31DK123977-01,The Role of Nitric oxide/cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (NO/cGMP) Signaling in Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are currently over 700,000 end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the United States.
Approximately 70% of ESRD patients undergo hemodialysis as their primary kidney
replacement therapy. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred type of vascular access in
hemodialysis patients. However, nearly 60% of AVFs created develop AVF maturation failure
due to early venous neointimal hyperplasia formation and impaired outward vascular
remodeling. The pathological mechanisms underlying AVF maturation failure is poorly
understood. Therefore, a major unmet clinical need in the field is the lack of effective
therapies to treat and prevent AVF maturation failure. The central hypothesis of this study is
that AVF creation will result in dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP activity that will
disrupt proper AVF maturation by influencing AVF remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia
formation. Therefore, NO/cGMP signaling pathway is an important therapeutic target for
clinically successful AVF maturation. In order to study the role of NO and cGMP on AVF
maturation we will 1) test the hypothesis that locally delivered NO therapy at the time of AVF
creation will improve AVF maturation by inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia and enhance AVF
remodeling, and reduce local inflammation; 2) test the hypothesis that a selective PDE5A
inhibitor, which prevents cGMP degradation, administered before and after AVF creation, will
improve AVF outward remodeling and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia; and will be also beneficial
in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where AVFs are created in this clinical setting.
These aims will be achieved using a rodent AVF model that has (1) an identical anatomic
configuration to human AVF and (2) recapitulates the lesion of progressive venous neointimal
hyperplasia seen in human AVF. Our studies are expected to elucidate the pathologic
significance of NO/cGMP signaling pathway on AVF maturation as well as provide the basis to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent AVF maturation failure in hemodialysis
patients.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5P50NS108675-02,Project 1: Role of Innate Immune Cells in Human Parkinson Disease,"Project Summary: Project 1
 Although Parkinson disease (PD) is conventionally thought to be a condition primarily affecting the brain,
recent studies have begun to shed light on the complex interactions between the brain and body involved in
the disease, particularly the immune system. Innate immunity is mediated by cells of myeloid lineage:
monocytes derived from bone marrow, tissue macrophages which arise from monocyte infiltration and
differentiation, and the resident microglia of the brain which are independently derived from the embryonic yolk
sac. Based on our preliminary data from the P20 Exploratory Grant Program, in this project our overarching
hypothesis is that innate immune cells are activated towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype early in
PD. We theorize that blocking this activation will protect from PD progression
 There are critical gaps in rigor of the available data which hinder the design and execution of
future therapeutic trials of immunomodulation. These gaps include: 1) nearly all previous studies of
inflammatory markers in PD have included heterogeneous groups of patients with a broad range of disease
severity, durations and treatments; 2) there has been a lack of attention to sex as a biological variable; 3) there
are no previous studies which directly examine monocytes populations in early PD, which we postulate to be
critically important; 4) there is little information on longitudinal change in inflammatory markers; and 5) there is
little data connecting brain and blood inflammatory markers to outcomes. Through the P20 program, we have
established the ability to study a unique human subject cohort of early, de novo PD (a term meaning patients
who have not yet received any anti-PD drug therapy) which will allow us to address these critical issues.
 Here we propose three aims which will directly address these critical knowledge gaps. In Aim 1, we
will study a cohort of 60 patients with de novo PD and 60 age- and sex-matched controls recruited by the
clinical core. We will determine whether peripheral immune activation or differentiation is associated with CNS
inflammation in early PD through integrated analysis of blood monocytes, blood and CSF cytokines and
chemokines, and brain imaging with the TSPO ligand 18F-DPA-714. In Aim 2, we will determine whether there
is change over time in monocytes populations assessed by flow cytometry or in blood cytokines and
chemokines. In Aim 3, we will examine the relationship between baseline measures of inflammation and
longitudinal clinical outcomes, particularly cognition, in this population of early de novo PD subjects
 These Aims are closely integrated with other components of the Alabama Udall Center. All of the human

5T32NS095775-03,UAB Training Program In Neuroscience,"Abstract
This is a proposal for a new T32 training program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This is a
focused program for predoctoral students in basic and translational approaches to neurodegenerative disease.
The rationale for establishing this new program is founded on three critical factors: 1) The aging of the US
population, which will soon lead to growth in the numbers of patients affected by neurodegenerative disease,
2) Rapid advances in tools and technologies in the neurosciences, and 3) The increasing interest in
neurosciences as a discipline by PhD students. A primary goal of this Training Program is to achieve cross-
cultural training; we seek to expose students to the biological mechanisms and research approaches used
across neurodegenerative disease, rather than the kind of single-disease training they might get working in an
individual research laboratory. This program will provide support for advanced pre-doctoral students in the
research phase of their training. Most students will enter the Neurodegeneration Training Program from the
UAB Graduate Biomedical Science Program, which admits about 80 students annually, or the UAB Medical
Scientist Training Program, which admits 8 students annually. Planned duration of appointment to the training
program is two years for each student. A total of 2 slots are requested in Year 1, and 4 slots in subsequent
years. Students will work under the supervision of one of 24 highly qualified mentors. Three of these are junior
mentors, and there are plans for mentor development and co-mentoring. The program incorporates required
didactic course work in neurodegeneration in both the first and second years, a newly developed formal course
in experimental rigor, training in new tools and technologies, instruction in the translational pathway and drug
development, a journal club on Neurodegeneration, an annual retreat, and mentor and outcomes evaluations.
Our core philosophy is that we seek to enable the cures of the future by providing a robust training pathway in
translational research. This unique emphasis will enable our students to take leading roles in therapeutic
discovery across the spectrum of different skills sets and enterprises which are required to deliver the vitally
needed treatments of the future.","Narrative
The aging of the US population will lead to unprecedented growth in the number of people affected by

5R25NS079188-08,UAB Research and Education Program in Neuroscience,"Abstract
 This is a proposal for continuation of an R25 research education award at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB). This program will support residents in neuroscience fields who are pursuing careers
combining clinical practice and research, and foster their development as physician-scientists.
 Over the past two decades, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to understanding
nervous system function in health and disease, and the result has been a vast expansion of knowledge
encompassing fundamental discoveries in genetics, genomics, neuro-oncology, neurochemistry, synaptic
plasticity, neural development, and behavior. It is clear, however, that there remains an unmet gap between
these advances and applications to human health. A pressing need for next-generation physician-scientists
includes: i) integrate discoveries about the nervous system from several domains into multi-modal and multi-
dimensional frameworks; and ii) formulate translational pathways to apply this knowledge to important
biomedical and behavioral problems.
 The new and exciting initiatives in this renewal proposal are as follows: 1) Dr. David Standaert
continues as Program Director, but he has been teamed with the new Associate Director, Dr. Ichiro Nakano; 2)
the scope has been expanded and now includes not only neurology, neurosurgery, and neuropathology but
also radiology and anesthesiology residents who are working areas consistent with the NINDS mission; 3) the
mentors have been organized around the four themes, that is, neuro-oncology, neurodegeneration, synaptic
plasticity, and cerebrovascular disease; 4) didactic components are strengthened, including a formal course in
experimental rigor.
 The Program Director and Associate Director are both physician-scientists with established track
records in research and training. Residents supported by this program will initiate their research during their
residency training, and continue it into a period of research fellowship following residency. Participants from all
disciplines will engage in a total of two years in full time research training. Their research experience will be
supported by a structured mentoring program along with didactic teaching in experimental rigor, professional
skills training, grant writing, and responsible conduct of research. The goal of the program will be to enable
residents and fellows to develop a career in neurological research, and to prepare them to successfully
compete for individual fellowships or mentored career development awards. As an institution, UAB is
exceptionally well positioned to undertake research education in the neurosciences, and to develop the
physician-scientists who will apply todayâ€™s discoveries to solve the challenges of tomorrow.","Narrative
Diseases of the nervous system create a great burden on our citizens and society, and there is a critical need
for new treatments and cures. This research education program will educate physician-scientists at the early

As stated in the Report to the NINDS Council (PD2014), â€œthe community of investigators focused on PD now strives to create therapies that meaningfully slow or stop the disease mechanisms that underlie all symptoms of PDâ€. The Alabama Udall Center is a response to these needs, and a product of our work under an NINDS Exploratory Grant Program in Parkinson's Disease Research (P20NS092530).  It has long been recognized that in post-mortem brain tissue from PD there is activation of the innate immune system, with prominent microgliosis in the substantia nigra together with enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines. Recently, it has become clear that there is also activation of adaptive immunity, with infiltration of T-cells and accumulation of immunoglobulins in perineural regions. We envisage that a better understanding of immune changes in PD will identify specific targets and therapeutic strategies that will block neurodegeneration.  This Center will address two overall scientific Aims: 1) to determine the extent and nature of immune activation in early human PD; and 2) to determine whether inhibiting LRRK2 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways can block immune responses that underlie alpha-synuclein linked neurodegeneration. Our central hypothesis is that innate and adaptive immune cells, particularly monocytes and T-cells, are activated early in disease, and that blocking LRRK2 or JAK/STAT signaling in these cells will protect from neurodegeneration. We will utilize advanced small molecule ligands and inhibitors, genetic approaches, detailed studies of subsets of immune cells and bone marrow transplantation approaches to test the hypothesis. Each project is anchored through the Clinical Core that will provide samples from human subjects, and the Animal Models Core that harmonizes pre-clinical studies in the alpha-synuclein mouse fibril model of PD.  The Alabama Udall Center also has important missions related to training and outreach. We seek to train the next generation of scientists and physicians, to accelerate progress towards PD treatments and cures of the future. We will engage the community of persons with PD who are our partners in these efforts. We seek to create a team and environment focused on the identification of innate and adaptive immune responses critical to PD pathogenesis, and rapidly advance an innovative, interdisciplinary, highly impactful research program.","The development of new treatments to slow or prevent Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a vital unmet need.

effective training and expertise in all aspects of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH)
procedures as applied to modern neuroscience research. For nearly ten years, the Core has focused on
training technicians, undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty investigators in
the theory and practice of IHC and ISH. This emphasis on education and hands on training facilitates the
propagation of these techniques beyond the Core itself and allows integration of IHC and ISH into many of the
NINDS funded laboratories at UAB. For experienced users, the Core directly assists with troubleshooting
difficult antibodies, establishing advanced detection amplification techniques, such as tyramide signal
amplification and Quantum Dots, and developing multi-label detection procedures. In this competitive renewal
application, Dr. David Standaert has assumed the role of Principal Investigator of Core B. He is a clinician-
scientist with a longstanding commitment to research and an excellent background in experimental
neuroanatomy. Dr. Terry Lewis remains the Technical Director of the Core and has over ten years' experience
in neuroscience related research. Dr. Lewis and Ms. Marissa Menard, a talented laboratory technician, work
closely and directly with Core users throughout their training and experimental investigations. It is proposed to
continue these services.
 It is proposed that the MDSC provide MicroBrightField stereology/morphometric systems which further
enables UAB neuroscientists to accurately assess and quantitate the results of their IHC and ISH
investigations. The additional stereology services to be offered in the MDSC uniquely positions the Core to
train and assist UAB Neuroscience investigators with complete planning and performance of IHC and ISH
experiments from fixation of tissue, section preparation, IHC/ISH protocol optimization, and final analysis
utilizing the MicroBrightField systems.
Over the previous nine years of funding, the MDSC has proven to be of great service to NINDS funded
investigators and the entire UAB Neuroscience community. The Core consistently trains and assists over 50

5R01HD089998-03,Longitudinal Examination of Driving Attention Among Adolescents,"Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adolescents,
accounting for approximately one in three deaths among teens ages 16 to 19. The primary contributor to MVCs
is driver inattention, which manifests as vulnerability to distraction. Yet, the relative contributions of young age
and low driving experience to driving inattention remains unsettled and the general development of attention
over the course of adolescence has received little study. The central hypothesis of this study is that driving
attention and driving outcomes are predicted by age and driving experience through improvements in
underlying cognitive mechanisms (general attention, speed of processing, and executive function). The long
term goal of the research program is to explain the etiology of adolescent motor vehicle crash risk and
translate findings to evidence-based interventions. In this longitudinal study, 220 adolescents will be enrolled
across four groups of 55: 16 and 18 year olds with and without driving experience.
The adolescents will
perform
general and driving based attention tasks, as well as cognitive function tasks at seven time points over
18 months. The combination of factorial and longitudinal designs will permit study of both the independent and
joint effects of age and driving experience on driving attention over time. Multiple methods will be used to
measure driving outcomes, including driving in a high fidelity driving simulator, self-report, and state crash
records. Driving attention in the simulator will also be examined under several distraction conditions, because
the presence of distractions challenges attention and is an important factor in MVC risk. Novel in-vehicle eye-
tracking methodologies will track changes in driving attention development over 18 months. Four Specific Aims
are proposed. Aim 1: Characterize the trajectory of driving attention development as a function of age
and driving experience. Aim 2: Characterize the roles of age and driving experience in driving attention
under varying levels of distraction. Aim 3: Examine the roles of underlying cognitive mechanisms
(general attention, speed of processing, executive function) in driving attention development as a
function of age and driving experience. Aim 4: Investigate how driving-specific attention development
impacts driving outcomes. MVCs are burdensome and costly to society. With inattention as the primary
contributor to MVCs, it is critical to gain a clearer understanding how driving attention develops during the
riskiest developmental period for drivers: adolescence (ages 16 to 18). The findings of the proposed study
have the potential to reduce MVCs by (a) shaping policy regarding optimal age and experience for licensure
and limitations imposed on young drivers and (b) providing targets for interventions to improve public health.","Project Narrative

5R37HL060024-22,Store-operated calcium entry: lung endothelial permeability,"Neurohumoral inflammatory mediators promote calcium entry through store operated calcium entry channels, and the resulting rise in cytosolic calcium disrupts the endothelial cell barrier and causes pulmonary edema. Canonical transient receptor potential proteins 1 and 4 contribute subunits that form the endothelial cell store operated calcium entry channel (TRPC1/4). Orai1 interacts with the this channel, and controls TRPC1/4 ion selectivity, as determined by whole cell electrophysiology. Our work has recently shown that in the absence of Orai1, more sodium and less calcium permeates through TRPC1/4. Because calcium is a principal second messenger that activates intracellular enzymes and regulatory proteins, considerable work has focused on the determinants of calcium influx. However, these new results suggest a potentially important role for sodium influx through TRPC1/4. We therefore measured the cytosolic calcium and sodium responses following activation of store operated calcium entry channels. Similar to our patch clamp results, we found that thapsigargin increases cytosolic sodium. Orai1 silencing substantially increases this cytosolic sodium response, but has a relatively small impact on the global cytosolic calcium response. Orai1 silencing prevented thapsigargin-induced gap formation. We interpreted these data to mean that elevated cytosolic sodium is a critical determinant of cellular movement. This idea was tested further in preliminary studies using migration and angiogenesis assays, where we observed that increased cytosolic sodium impairs cellular motility and angiogenesis. Hence, we now test the HYPOTHESIS that Orai1 interacts with TRPC1/4 channels and modulates the channel's calcium and sodium selectivity important for control of endothelial cell barrier function, migration and angiogenesis. Specific aims test the related hypotheses that: (1) Orai1 interaction with the TRPC1/4 channel modulates the magnitude and spatial spread ofthe cytosolic sodium and calcium signals; and (2) sodium influx through the Orai1-TRPC1/4 channel strengthens the endothelial cell barrier and reduces cell migration and angiogenesis.

5P01HL066299-17,Lung endothelial cell phenotypes,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endothelium lines blood vessels and interconnects all organ systems. However, endothelial cells exhibit a rich
diversity in structure and function. Such heterogeneity is apparent between endothelial cells in different
organs, in endothelial cells along a single vascular segment within an organ, and between immediately
adjacent cells. This program project grant is founded on the overall hypothesis that endothelium lining
pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins is phenotypically distinct, where each cell type is specialized
to fulfill the unique demands of its vascular niche. Specialization among these cells is encoded by discrete
organization of second messenger signaling networks. Therefore, in this competitive renewal each of our
projects examines the organization and function of endothelial cell signaling networks. We evaluate the origin
of second messenger signals, how these signals spread inside of the cell, what limits the lifespan of the
signals, and which effector proteins are principally activated by the signals. For the first time we can measure
three-dimensional spread of second messengers in realistic cellular geometries over time. Bacteria such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa impair endothelial cell function during the course of infection that culminates in
acute lung injury. P. aeruginosa alters the organization and function of second messenger signaling, and in
some instances, the bacterium utilizes enzymes that generate second messenger signals during the host-
pathogen interaction. P. aeruginosa and its exoenzymes disrupt the endothelial cell barrier, and hence, our
projects use this bacterium and its toxins to probe determinants of endothelial heterogeneity and function,
including barrier integrity. All projects take advantage of vertically integrated approaches, ranging from the use
of cultured cells (e.g. with control for substrate stiffness) to various in situ (e.g. isolated organs, lung slices,
isolated blood vessels, and cell-free lung scaffolds) and in vivo preparations. In each of these cases, attention
is paid to what is similar, and what is dissimilar, about the respective cell phenotypes. Altogether, projects
systematically address three specific aims or objectives, to: (1) identify and test novel molecular mechanisms
(e.g. signatures) that are responsible for site-specific endothelial cell function, especially in the microcirculation,
(2) determine the importance of these mechanisms in preclinical models of disease, and (3) translate novel
therapeutic approaches to preclinical models of disease. Projects are highly interactive. Defining mechanisms
that underlie second messenger signaling networks will not only inform us as to the nature of endothelial cell
heterogeneity, but provide unprecedented insight into host-pathogen interactions that disrupt the endothelial
cell barrier and cause tissue edema. Mechanistic insight into endothelial signal transduction networks will
reveal novel therapeutic approaches to improve endothelial dysfunction.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5P01HL066299-17,Soluble adenylyl cyclases in pulmonary endothelial permeability,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Soluble adenylyl cyclases generate a cAMP signal that breaks down microtubules leading to endothelial cell
barrier disruption. The P. aeruginosa type 3 secretion system effector exoenzyme Y is one such soluble
cyclase. However, we have discovered that this enzyme is a promiscuous nucleotidyl cyclase capable of
generating both purine and pyrimidine (i.e. non-canonical) cyclic nucleotide monophosphates, including cGMP,
cUMP, and cAMP. The cAMP signal, and to a lesser extent the cGMP signal, activates protein kinase A, which
phosphorylates tau leading to microtubule breakdown. Phosphorylated tau accumulates inside the
endothelium for several hours as a high molecular weight, or oligomeric, form, and is then released from the
cell into the supernatant in vitro, and bronchoalveolar lavage and blood in vivo. Preliminary data suggest
cellular release of high molecular weight tau is stimulated by cUMP. Our previously published work and recent
preliminary studies indicate high molecular weight tau retrieved from cellular supernatant fractions is heat
stable, protease resistant, insoluble in certain detergents, insensitive to RNase and DNase treatments, and can
be resolved in a 30-50% ammonium sulfate fraction by column chromatography. It can be sedimented by
centrifugation with an angular momentum of 1.14 x 1012. This high molecular weight tau is transmissible
between cells, leading to inter-endothelial cell gap formation, increased permeability and cytotoxicity;
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells are especially sensitive to this injury. Its cytotoxicity is inactivated
by phenol extraction, by post-translational modification with diethylpyrocabonate, and with hexafluoro-2-
propanol, all characteristics of amyloid proteins. We have searched for a means to prevent the transmissible
cytotoxicity as an anti-inflammatory therapy. We have recently discovered that prion protein is expressed in
lung endothelium. Whereas prion antibody treatment initiates a pro-survival signal and prevents tau-induced
hyperpermeability and cytotoxicity, prion protein genetic deletion increases endothelial sensitivity to the high
molecular weight tau. Hence, this proposal tests the hypothesis that ExoY generates purine and pyrimidine
cyclic nucleotides in endothelium and induces release of high molecular weight tau capable of generating
transmissible hyperpermeability and cytotoxicity, an effect prevented by antibody ligation of prion protein.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01AI137043-01A1,Interplay between the Mtb electron transport chain and carbon metabolism,"Tuberculosis, caused by the etiological agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the leading cause of death
worldwide from a curable infectious agent and is becoming a major concern due to the spread of drug resistant
Mtb strains. Notably, Mtb can persist in a dormant, drug resistant state, sometimes reactivating to cause TB
decades after the primary infection. Currently, there is strong interest in exploiting oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) as a metabolic target for new anti-TB drugs and drug combinations. In this regard, there are several
antimycobacterial drugs that target the Mtb electron transport chain (ETC), including bedaquiline (the first new
TB drug in ~40 years), Q203, clofazimine, and phenothiazines. However, how inhibition of respiratory complexes
in the ETC leads to effective killing has yet to be established. We believe there is a critical gap in our
understanding of how OXPHOS communicates with central carbon catabolism in response to changing
environmental fuel sources to survive the host immune response and anti-TB drug therapy.
 Our long-term goal is to define the bioenergetic mechanisms that enable Mtb to survive within the host
in a dormant, drug resistant state. In this proposal, our central hypothesis is that the interplay between the Mtb
ETC and central carbon catabolism prevents effective killing by anti-TB drugs. To test this hypothesis, we have
established a series of specific aims to determine how OXPHOS-generated ATP modulates central carbon
catabolism and succinate excretion to maintain metabolic homeostasis, examine the mechanisms whereby
simultaneous inhibition of OXPHOS and glycolysis kills Mtb, and test the hypothesis that bioenergetic
homeostasis in clinical strains of Mtb contributes to drug tolerance. We will make use of a novel technology
termed extracellular flux (XF) analysis that we have adapted for studying Mtb bioenergetics in real time. This
technology will be complemented by 13C stable isotope analyses using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
 This contribution is significant, because it has the potential to identify a new paradigm that will lead to a
detailed mechanistic understanding of how the Mtb ETC communicates with central carbon catabolism, and how
disruption of this process could be exploited to sterilize Mtb. This proposal is innovative in our opinion, because
the newly adapted technology that is supported by metabolomics, distinguish itself from conventional approaches
for studying energy metabolism in pathogenic microbes.","There is strong interest in developing drug compounds that target and disrupt oxidative phosphorylation

effective killing by anti-TB drugs.",2019,458227,332863,125364,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis,ADRIE JC STEYN
5R01AI111940-05,Heme oxygenase-1 and the bioenergetic threshold of latent TB and HIV co-infection,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide are asymptomatically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Co-infection with HIV dramatically increases the risk of developing active TB and constitutes a major impediment to global public health. Notably, there has been little basic research toward defining the mechanisms by which HIV modulates Mtb to enter, persist and emerge from a persistent state in the human tuberculous lung to cause active TB disease. We and others have recently discovered that carbon monoxide (CO), generated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), is an Mtb dormancy signal and that HO-1 is necessary for granuloma formation. Further, it has been shown that HO-1 inhibits HIV replication. These findings suggest a key role for HO-1 in control of the TB/AIDS syndemic wherein HO-1 is key regulator of latency and reservoir maintenance. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which HIV modulates TB latency and how these mechanisms can be manipulated for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. The objective of this work is to generate a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the role of HO-1 and host bioenergetics in the context of TB and HIV infection. Our central hypothesis, based on substantial preliminary data, is that HIV causes an imbalance in the bioenergetic threshold of host cells, which is maintained by HO-1, to shift the balance from latent TB to an active infection. Our rationale is that the successful completion of this proposal will contribute missing, mechanistic elements of HO-1-dependent disease function to our base of knowledge, without which the mechanism of TB latency and HIV-mediated reactivation cannot be fully understood. We will apply novel techniques such as real-time metabolic flux analysis to non-invasively measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), spare respiratory capacity (SRC), maximal respiration and ATP turnover of cells infected with Mtb and/or HIV. This powerful technology has not yet been applied to study the bioenergetics of bacterial/viral host interaction. We also will exploit novel HO-1 transgenic animals, and human TB lung tissue to accurately describe roles for HO-1 in TB/HIV in vivo. Further, we will examine the bioenergetic status of healthy, latent TB, active TB, TB/HIV and HIV-infected patients in South Africa. The research is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by applying novel technologies and unique patient cohorts to examine HO-1 and bioenergetics as paradigms to better understand TB/HIV disease. This contribution is significant because it is the first step in the continuum of TB/HIV research that will (i) provide in-depth mechanistic insight from a basic and clinical research point of view into the role of HO-1 in regulating HIV and Mtb disease, (ii) characterize the ""bioenergetic threshold"" of TB/HIV patients, and (iii) identify the Mtb/HIV co-infected cell populations and cellular events in human lung granulomas. Overall, these studies will provide a new basis for understanding TB and HIV persistence in the human tuberculous lung.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    
Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide are asymptomatically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and HIV co-infection dramatically increases the risk of developing active TB. Our hypothesis is that HIV causes an imbalance in the bioenergetic threshold, maintained by heme oxygenase -1, to shift the balance from a latent TB to an active infection.

5R61AI138280-02,METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OF T CELL ENERGY METABOLISM IN TUBERCULOSIS AND HIV,"Close to 1.7 billion people worldwide are asymptomatically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the
etiological agent of TB. Co-infection with HIV and the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-
resistant (XDR) Mtb strains constitutes a major impediment to worldwide public health control measures. T cell
exhaustion, defined as the deterioration of T cell function, is a hallmark of many chronic infections due to
prolonged antigen exposure and inflammatory signals present at the site of infection. However, very little is
known regarding the link between these functionally exhausted cells and their metabolic insufficiencies,
particularly in the context of the human TB/HIV lung. Given that immune activation is critically energy-dependent,
and that pathogens cause imbalances in metabolism, there is a gap in our knowledge on how Mtb/HIV
reprograms immunometabolic pathways, and whether this can be reversed by host-directed therapy (HDT) to
rejuvenate T cell metabolism. Our long-term goal is to understand how Mtb/HIV perturbs host metabolism leading
to disease, reactivation, or death of the host, and how this knowledge can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes.
Our central hypothesis is that Mtb/HIV dysregulates T cell energy metabolism in the human lung, leading to the
suppression of effective immune control of localized infection, which could be restored by HDT. This hypothesis
has been formulated based on an unusual global collaborative effort between basic science investigators,
cardiothoracic surgeons, and pathologists in South Africa, and epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic experts
in the USA and Europe. Our hypothesis is built upon substantial Preliminary Data which demonstrate the
feasibility of routine analyses of freshly resected human TB lung tissue, and show that Mtb controls distinct
bioenergetic pathways and immune checkpoints. The rationale is several fold: Firstly, phenotypic
characterization of functionally exhausted T cell populations has been largely restricted to animal models, and
to date, there have been no studies examining these populations from freshly resected human TB/HIV lung
tissue, representing a significant translational gap in our knowledge. Secondly, examining the metabolic
requirements of functionally exhausted T cell populations in the human TB/HIV lung will enable us to identify key
metabolic checkpoints that may represent novel pharmacological targets for HDT. With greater knowledge of the
metabolic checkpoints involved in T cell exhaustion, HDT may be a possible intervention strategy to revitalize
these cells and reinvigorate anti-TB immunity. Thirdly, identifying nutritional requirements and metabolic
pathways that promote productive T cell responses and hinder the transition towards exhausted T cell programs
could provide exciting new benchmarks for TB/HIV vaccine design. The research is innovative, because it
represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by applying novel technologies and unique
patient cohorts to examine T cell exhaustion in the human TB lung. This contribution is significant because it has
the potential to breach a major barrier in the TB field; routine analysis of freshly resected TB lung tissue.","T cell exhaustion, defined as the deterioration of T cell function, is a hallmark of many chronic infections due to

5R01AI134810-02,Hydrogen Sulfide and Tuberculosis Disease,"TB remains a global epidemic infecting nearly 2.2 billion people worldwide and causing 1.4 million deaths
annually. Understanding the mechanisms of how Mtb enters, maintains and emerges from a dormant state
is a vitally important question in the TB field that has not been adequately addressed. New paradigms for
how Mtb can persist for decades, and then suddenly reactivate to cause disease, are desperately needed to
combat this global epidemic. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been identified as the third endogenously
produced gasotransmitter in mammalian cells that is an important cell signalling molecule in numerous
biological systems. One of the most exciting biological features of H2S is that it induces a state of â€œsuspended
animationâ€; a hibernation-like metabolic status characterized by a reversible marked reduction of energy
expenditure. While H2S has overlapping functions with CO and NO, a role for H2S in Mtb disease progression
remains unexplored. Our long-term goal is to dissect new molecular mechanisms that promote Mtb
persistence within the host and to use this information to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat or
prevent TB. Our central hypothesis, based upon exciting preliminary data, is that Mtb infection triggers a
localized increase of host-generated H2S that (i) induces a state of deeply reduced metabolism to impede an
adequate immune response, and (ii) stimulates Mtb respiration and growth, to accelerate death of the host.
The rationale of this proposal is that successful completion of our aims will establish a new paradigm for
understanding Mtb disease and persistence. Once the mechanisms whereby Mtb persists are known, we
anticipate that targeted pharmacological manipulation will result in novel and more effective approaches to the
prevention and treatment of TB. We will apply novel techniques such as real-time extracellular metabolic flux
analysis and stable isotope analysis of immune cells, transgenic H2S-deficient mice, and freshly resected
human TB lung tissue from a well-established patient cohort in Durban, South Africa to accurately describe
roles for H2S in the bioenergetics and immunometabolism of TB. The research is innovative, in our opinion,
because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by applying novel technologies and unique
patient cohorts to examine the role of H2S in TB for the first time. This contribution is significant because it has
the potential to make a lasting, positive change to existing paradigms in TB research, particularly into how the
gasotransmitter H2S impacts Mtb energy metabolism and dormancy as well as dysregulation of innate and
adaptive immune cells during infection.","Project Narrative

1F31NR018782-01A1,"Influence of Race, Gender, Rurality, and Dyadic Health on Symptom Trajectories in Persons with Advanced Heart Failure","Project Summary
Heart failure affects over 6.5 million adults and that number is quickly growing, especially in the diverse and
rural Southern populations where health disparities are highly prevalent. While patients could benefit from
recommended palliative care integration at diagnosis of advanced heart failure, most patients are referred late-
if at all. A major goal of palliative care in heart failure is aggressive symptom management which family
caregivers play an integral role in. To provide better quality care for advanced heart failure patients and family
caregivers, it is crucial to have information on disease and symptom trajectories to develop an individualized
treatment plan and to establish care consistent with patients' goals. Heart failure patients report as many as 19
co-occurring symptoms; however, there is limited research characterizing co-occurring symptom pattern
trajectories. Furthermore, there is little information about the relationship of these symptoms with the patient
and caregiver's quality of life individually and as a dyad. This proposed research study will address this
research gap and provide quantitative data on advanced heart failure symptom pattern trajectories including
the impact of caregiver support. The ultimate goal is to develop symptom management palliative care
interventions which improve symptom burden. This study leverages existing data collected from the parent
ENABLE: CHF-PC (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends, Comprehensive Heartcare for Patients and
Caregivers; 5R01NR013665; Bakitas PI) multisite randomized controlled trial. ENABLE CHF PC featured a
telehealth, palliative care intervention for Southern underserved and rural populations. The proposed study will
examine longitudinal symptom data from this parent study (3 time points) using latent variable modeling
analyses to address the unique specific aims: 1) identify and segregate distinct symptom pattern trajectories in
older adult palliative care intervention participants with advanced heart failure living in the Deep South and 2)
quantify associations between sociodemographic characteristics (such as race, gender, rurality, and dyadic
health), clinical/physiological characteristics, and symptom pattern trajectories. This proposed study is
consistent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goals of promoting personalized health strategies
and helping to manage and relieve symptoms and suffering in the palliative and end of life setting for diverse
populations. This NRSA proposal will serve as an essential foundation for the applicant's goal of developing as
an independent nurse scientist with a program of research aiming to improve the quality of life and symptom
burden of heart failure patients and their family caregivers using a palliative care paradigm through this
application's proposed training plan, the resources provided at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and
guided mentorship on the relevant concepts of palliative care, family caregivers, heart failure symptom
management, health disparities, nursing science, advanced statistical analyses, and scientific dissemination.","Project Narrative

5F30AG058458-02,Contribution of the interaction between synuclein and tau in the pathophysiology of dementia with Lewy bodies,"Project Summary
This application is for F30 support of Lindsay Stoyka during the laboratory phase of her MD/PhD
training.
 The scientific focus of the proposal is to examine how endogenous microtubule binding protein tau
interacts with pathologic variants of alpha-synuclen to lead to cellular dysfunction and death, alpha-synuclein
aggregation, and cognitive decline in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). DLB is the second most common
cognitive disorder in the elderly and is characterized by fluctuating cognitive performance, visuospatial
impairment, and frontosubcortical dysfunction. Intracellular aggregates of alpha-synuclein (termed Lewy
bodies) are found in neurons throughout the deep cortical layers, paralimbic, and neocortical structures of DLB
patients. The rationale behind the present proposal is that tau has been shown to bind to alpha-synuclein
fibrils, but not monomer, suggesting a pathogenic interaction that is nonexistent in the non-diseased state.
Additionally, Lewy body presence in the basal forebrain and limbic areas correlate with deteriorating cognitive
function in humans. A clear synergistic effect of pathogenic alpha-synuclein and tau have been shown both in
vitro and in vivo. However, few studies have explored the role of endogenous tau on alpha-synuclein
aggregation in a DLB model. Determining the mechanisms at play in Lewy Body formation will facilitate the
development of appropriate and specific therapies for DLB patients.
 The proposed training plan for Lindsay Stoyka is sponsored by her project mentors, Dr. David
Standaert and Dr. Volpicelli-Daley. The overall goal of the training plan is to provide the PI with a solid
foundation for a successful career as a physician scientist. A project based both in translational approaches,
while focused on a disease-oriented pathogenesis, is the ideal training environment for any aspiring physician
scientist.
 Included in the training plan are experiences that help the PI: 1) gain competence in a variety of
techniques in neurobiology 2) collaborate with other scientists, 3) develop hypothesis-driven research, 4)
present data in a written and oral format, 5) effectively integrate research with clinic, and 6) responsibly
conduct research.","Project Narrative

1U19AI142759-01,Project 2 - Novel Therapeutics for Emerging Alphavirus,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses cause outbreaks of incapacitating acute and chronic arthritis and life-
threatening encephalitis. The arthritogenic alphaviruses include the re-emerging chikungunya (CHIKV),
Mayaro, and Ross River viruses. Since 2004, CHIKV has infected millions of people and expanded into
Europe, Asia, and Americas. As arthritis can endure for months to years after infection with an arthritogenic
alphavirus, large epidemics have severe economic consequences. The encephalitic alphaviruses include
Eastern, Venezuelan (VEEV), and Western equine encephalitis viruses that are endemic to the Americas and
infection can lead to mortality or long-term neurological sequelae. There are currently no approved alphavirus-
specific vaccines or antiviral agents. In collaboration with Southern Research, we used HTS to identify non-
toxic small molecules that inhibit CHIKV and VEEV replication. Additionally, we identified chemically distinct
compound classes that display broad inhibitory activity against alphaviruses, as well as other pathogenic
human viruses (e.g., flaviviruses). We also mapped resistance mutants against two highly active compounds
and identified the alphavirus nsP2 helicase domain and the nsP3 macrodomain as potential antiviral targets. In
addition to this work, in collaboration with the Emory Institute for Drug Development, we identified novel
nucleosides, which target RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, with potent antiviral activity against alphavirus
infection. Thus, we have identified potent antiviral compounds against three distinct molecular targets essential
for alphavirus replication. The goal of this highly interactive Project 2 of the Antiviral Drug Discovery and
Development Center (AD3C) is to develop new therapeutic strategies that inhibit alphavirus replication, prevent
selection for drug resistance, and reduce alphavirus disease severity. In Specific Aim 1, lead compounds will
be optimized in collaboration with Core A and Core B by iterative medicinal chemistry, cell culture-based
antiviral and cytotoxicity assays, and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies to improve their efficacy, selectivity,
solubility, and bioavailability. In Specific Aim 2, we will work with the other AD3C Projects to define the breadth
of antiviral activity and cell type specificity, molecular targets through resistance mapping and
structural/computational analyses and identify synergy profiles for compounds with potent activity. In Specific
Aim 3, optimized compounds will be evaluated for in vivo efficacy using well-established pre-clinical mouse
models of alphavirus infection. Since therapies that target different aspects of the viral life cycle are likely to
show improved efficacy and limit the development of drug resistance, combination therapies also will be tested.
Last of all, since alphavirus-induced disease includes inflammatory immune pathology, we will evaluate the
therapeutic potential of combining antiviral therapy with anti-inflammatory regimens. This work will promote the
development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies that have the potential to improve human health.",,2019,1056208,1019833,36375,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Antimicrobial Resistance; Arthritis; Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases,DANIEL N STREBLOW

 Project Summary Abstract
The over-arching commercial goal for this Nitor Therapeutics, Inc. (Nitor) and DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM)
collaboration is to discover and validate Stimulator of Interferon Genes or â€œSTINGâ€ inhibitor ligands in a novel
high-throughput screening (HTS) and validation-based Critical Path of bioassays. Aberrant activation of the
STING pathway by self DNA and â€˜gain of functionâ€™ mutations in the STING protein dimer can lead to
autoimmune disease. Therefore, we hypothesize that STING inhibitory ligands may be a promising new
strategy for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in which suppression of the type I IFN
pathway may show therapeutic benefit. The Nitor and DBM collaboration has designed a Critical Path of cell-
based bioassays with HTS and validation bioassay steps so as to discover STING inhibitor ligands from a de
novo screen of a diverse small molecule library derived from 8 different commercial vendors and from a
targeted screen of nucleosides/nucleotides from our collaborators at TheraChem. Preliminary data is
presented from a pilot screen of approximately 2,000 compounds and from early validation steps scripted
within our Critical Path. Milestone 1 focuses on optimizing and cementing our STING Inhibitor HTS and
Validation Critical Path. Later efforts in Milestone 1 will validate these STING inhibitors on additional reporter
cell lines with more physiological relevance (a THP-1 monocytic cell line stably expressing the STING reporter)
and on more relevant diseased human PBMCs isolated from lupus patients. Our validated STING inhibitor
ligands will be evaluated by assessing the effect of the inhibitor ligand on the production and secretion of
interferon-ï¢ (IFN-ï¢) and other secreted inflammatory mediators in response to cGAMP. Milestone 2 will focus
on the full HTS campaign to discover and validate novel small molecule STING inhibitors. Chemoinformatics
analysis of the validated hits will be performed throughout the HTS campaign so as to identify emerging hit
chemical series rapidly. We will then re-profile â€˜best in classâ€™ small molecules from each chemical series of
family where a common scaffold has been identified. Phase 2 SBIR-driven work is envisioned where STING
inhibitor ligand chemical series where medicinal and formulation chemistry optimization is performed on the
best hit-to-lead chemical series, where in vitro ADME and in vivo PK/PD are performed, and where in vivo
proof-of-concept studies are performed in lupus animal models and mouse models of interferonapathies with
key lead small molecules.

 Public Health Relevance Statement
Autoimmune diseases are syndromes or disorders in which the body inappropriately targets its own organs,
tissues or cells as being foreign or â€˜non-self.â€™ DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. (DBM) and Nitor Therapeutics (Nitor) are
focused on discovering novel â€œStimulator of Interferon Genesâ€ or â€œSTINGâ€ inhibitors for autoimmune diseases.
Among these autoimmune or â€˜autoinflammatoryâ€™ diseases, it has become apparent that a recently discovered
modulatory protein in immunity signaling called â€œStimulator of Interferon Genesâ€ or â€œSTINGâ€ is affected directly
or indirectly. The most common autoimmune disease is â€œLupusâ€ (known formally as systemic lupus
erythematosus or SLE). There is no cure for SLE, and it is mainly treated with medicines that suppress the
immune system with the aim of keeping symptoms under control. These medicines have many debilitating side
effects. As such, the ultimate goal and unmet clinical need is to discover and develop a more focused
therapeutic for the â€œLupus umbrella of diseases.â€ Lupus falls under the mandate of the NIAID at the NIH and is
a focus of Nitor Therapeutics. In addition, we are focused on more specific rare or niche autoimmune diseases
within the Lupus umbrella. DBM is interested particularly in Respiratory and Renal Diseases therapeutic areas.
Importantly, gain-of-function mutations in the STING gene cause early-onset lung vasculopathy and pulmonary
inflammation in human patients, now categorized as â€œSAVIâ€ or â€˜STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in
infancy.â€™ These newly categorized diseases are hyperinflammatory in nature and affect mainly the lung, blood
vessels within the lung and the skin. Patients with SAVI can also develop widespread lung damage that leads
to pulmonary fibrosis and difficulty in breathing. The SAVI diseases fall under the NHLBI mission. Gain-of-
function mutations in the gene encoding STING render the protein constitutively active or more sensitive to
stimulation by cGAMP, which results in elevated production of interferons by a variety of cells. There are also
other rare autoimmune disorders and syndromes that display a prominent interferon-response-gene signature
that may be treated with a STING inhibitor. Of importance to DBM, STING inhibitors may also be beneficial in
the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). LN falls under the mission of the NIDDK. As such, Nitor Therapeutics,
Inc. and DiscoveryBioMed, Inc. have formed a synergistic collaboration so as to discover novel and innovative
STING inhibitor ligands from a high-throughput screening program using intact, living reporter cell lines. We will
validate these inhibitors on primary leukocytes (PBMCs) isolated from Lupus patients monitoring for potential
therapeutic effects in vitro. The ultimate commercial goal is to develop orally bioavailable and/or inhaled small
molecule STING inhibitors for common and rare autoimmune diseases.

5R21EB025921-02,Demonstrate Efficacy of Low-Intensity-Ultrasound in Improving Microfracture Outcomes.,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The degeneration of cartilage at load-bearing joints causes considerable musculoskeletal morbidity and is a
major healthcare burden in the United States. While several treatment options exist, including autologous
chondrocyte transplantation and implantation of tissue-engineered substitutes, they are expensive and of limited
efficacy. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel method to improve the therapeutic outcomes
of microfracture (MF) by engineering a treatment modality that delivers low-intensity ultrasound (LIUS; < 50
mW/cm2) with chondroinductive and chondroprotective properties to the defect site. Two specific aims will be
undertaken to accomplish the project goal: (1) develop a theoretical basis for LIUS therapy and (2) demonstrate
efficacy of LIUS in improving MF outcomes in a rabbit model of chondral injury. This work goes beyond existing
empirical approaches reported in the literature by proposing to identify the in-vivo resonance frequency range
where the bioeffects of LIUS are maximized and link the macroscopic settings of transducer frequency, power,
and exposure times to repair outcomes in order to reduce the variability in clinical outcomes and optimize
efficacy. This R21 proposal integrates and builds on the project team's innovative finding that the bioeffects of
ultrasound (US) are frequency-dependent and that the cell response to US is maximized at the resonant
frequency and the biological finding that in-vitro LIUS at the resonant frequency aids the proliferation of
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); promotes chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs; and maintains the
chondrocytic phenotype by upregulating SOX9, the key transcription factor in chondrogenesis. The project
team's aggregate in-vitro preliminary data suggest that the use of LIUS will significantly improve cartilage
regeneration procedures that seek to recruit MSCs and induce lineage-specific conversion without the use of
growth factors that pose common side effects such as hypertrophy and fibrosis. These data led to this project's
central hypothesis that LIUS regimens can benefit cartilage repair therapies in three ways: (1) LIUS can
enhance the migration of progenitor cells, (2) LIUS can enhance in situ chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs,
and (3) continuing LIUS stimulation of chondrocytes improves the formation of hyaline cartilage. This hypothesis-
driven research promises to result in a more fundamental understanding of the therapeutic value of LIUS,
which is expected to ultimately lead to the development of a LIUS-based regimen and delivery system capable
of generating a stable hyaline cartilage phenotype via minimally invasive MF procedures. Such progress would,
in turn, directly address the needs of 46 million Americans who suffer from osteoarthritis.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R03AG062730-01,Achieving Integrative Cartilage Repair Success Under Low Intensity Ultrasound,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Osteochondral grafts or Matrix-Assisted-Cell-Implantation (MACI) are promising strategies to treat chondral
lesions as articular cartilage does not heal spontaneously. One characteristic shared by intrinsic reparative
processes and surgical therapies is an apparent lack of lateral integration of repair or graft tissue with the host
cartilage that can lead to poor prognosis. The goal of this R03 project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
employing a relatively non-invasive adjunct such as continuous low-intensity ultrasound (cLIUS) to enhance
integration. Previous therapies have had varied levels of success with pulsed LIUS (pLIUS @ 1.5 MHz), but have
used an arbitrary treatment that doesn't take into account knee tissue properties or tissue response to LIUS. To
progress beyond the status quo that employs an empirically derived pLIUS at 1.5 MHz for in vivo applications,
first, our approach employs cLIUS as it couples more energy when compared to pLIUS. Importantly, our ongoing
innovative research represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by shifting the focus to the
following: (1) identification of a clinically relevant tissue resonant frequency range of 3.8 Â± 0.3 MHz, where cLIUS
induced bioeffects are maximized by accounting for the tissue properties, and (2) understanding of the
propagation of cLIUS at these higher frequencies in the joint space and in the vicinity of the defect to permit
optimal cLIUS regimens and route of delivery. Taken together, these innovations enable us to deliver therapeutic
dosages of cLIUS to enable cartilage repair. Based on our promising in vitro findings that demonstrate the cLIUS
to be chondroprotective and chondrpoinductive, our central hypothesis is that cLIUS will aid in the cartilage-to-
cartilage integration of critical sized defects in a rabbit model of subchondral injury by promoting migration and
enhancing chondrogenesis to a degree greater than approaches without cLIUS treatment. To test this, one
specific aim will be undertaken: 1: Demonstrate enhanced cartilage integration under LIUS. Our objective is to
demonstrate that cLIUS will achieve reproducible integrative cartilage repair and maintain normal articular
cartilage histologic and biomechanical characteristics in a rabbit model of chondral repair. Rabbits will be
euthanized after 4 and 12 weeks of cLIUS treatment, at which time cartilage regeneration and integration will be
assessed. In addition to non-stimulated controls, group comparison will be made with the standard US regimen
that uses pulsed US signal at 1.5 MHz with 1 kHz repeat. Successful completion of this work is expected to lead
to the development of a cLIUS-based regimen and delivery system capable of promoting integration at the graft
interface. This presents an exciting potential treatment modality for orthopedic surgeons attempting to treat
patients with this difficult clinical problem. This would, in turn, directly address the needs of 46 million Americans
who suffer from osteoarthritis at an estimated cost of $128 billion annually in the U.S. alone.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

2I01BX002930-05,Renal Cancer Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms to Therapy,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men and women. It is also a
malignancy that is prevalent in the Veteran population. A recent analysis of VA Central Cancer Registry
(VACCR) data demonstrates that cancer of the kidney is the fourth most common cancer in the veteran
population. The vast majority of studies on RCC biology have focused on primary tumors including recent
large-scale sequencing data sets. Patients with disease confined to the kidney have excellent outcomes. In
contrast, the development of metastasis is the seminal event that occurs in patients who succumb to this
disease. While there are several approved therapies for advanced renal cancer, the reality is that progress in
the treatment of metastasis with systemic therapies has been incremental. This fact mandates the need for
new therapeutic approaches. The objective of this proposal is to identify the key alterations specifically in
metastasis and to use this information to improve the outcomes of those affected with this disease.
Transcriptomic analysis of normal kidney, primary RCC, and metastatic RCC samples demonstrates that loss
of expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1ï¡) is a
metastasis-associated alteration. This transcription factor has an established role in mitochondrial and fatty
acid metabolism as well as other metabolic pathways. Prior studies in cancer have demonstrated conflicting
roles for this factor in cancer. Preliminary studies demonstrate that restoration of PGC1ï¡ expression in kidney
cancer cells suppresses invasive phenotypes in vitro and metastasis in vivo. In addition to loss of this factor,
metastatic tissues are notable for increased expression of several collagen genes. Preliminary data indicates
that collagens promote invasive behavior in RCC cells. Based on these preliminary data, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that PGC1ï¡ suppresses metastasis by coordinating its epigenetic and metabolic
programs to inhibit pro-invasive signaling. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, will be
tested through pursuit of the following specific aims: 1) determine the epigenetic basis by which PGC1ï¡
suppresses metastasis, 2) determine the role of metabolism in supporting collagen biosynthesis in renal cancer
cells, and 3) determine the mechanisms by which collagen promotes invasive behavior. The proposal has
translational significance as the information gathered from each aim could pave the way for new treatment
strategies for patients with advanced RCC. Ultimately, the knowledge gathered has the potential to improve
the efficacy of treatment for Veterans with advanced RCC, an unmet need challenging the contemporary
management of this disease.","Kidney cancer is among the most common malignancies in both men and women. It is highly prevalent in the
Veteran population and a recent analysis of VA Central Cancer Registry Data indicates that cancer of the kidney
is the fourth most common malignancy. While the outcomes for patients with disease confined to the kidney are
excellent, patients with advanced disease that has metastasized, face a poor prognosis despite the fact that
there are now several approved systemic therapies. The current knowledge base for this cancer has focused
on primary kidney tumors. In contrast, the key alterations that mediate the spread of kidney cancer are poorly
understood. However, the identification of these alterations and their contribution to aggressive kidney cancer
could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. This proposal aims to identify the key factors that promote invasive
phenotypes in renal cancer and provide mechanistic insight into the development of metastasis. The goal is to
develop new therapies that can be rapidly advanced into the clinic to improve the outcomes of Veterans.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,SUNIL  SUDARSHAN
5R01CA200653-04,Regulation of the Kidney Cancer Epigenome by Oncometabolite L-2-Hydroxyglutarate,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men
and women. Unfortunately, progress in the treatment of patients with advanced disease has been incremental,
and new treatment approaches are warranted. Altered metabolism, an established hallmark of malignancy,
may provide novel therapeutic opportunities. Oncometabolites, small molecules with putative transforming
properties, represent one of the clearest links between metabolism and cancer. A unifying theme amongst the
oncometabolites identified to date is their ability to alter the epigenome via inhibition of enzymes involved in
DNA and histone demethylation. In the context of RCC, there is increasing recognition of the role of
epigenetics to the pathogenesis of this malignancy. However, the drivers of the RCC epigenome remain
poorly characterized. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand the role of metabolism in renal
carcinogenesis to develop novel therapies that will improve outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to
identify the metabolic basis for the epigenetic landscape of RCC and to determine the effects on tumorigenesis.
Studies by our laboratory and others have identified elevations of the putative oncometabolite (L)-2-
hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) in RCC as well as brain tumors. Elevations of L-2HG in RCC are due to reduced
expression of L2HGDH (L-2HG dehydrogenase) which is located on chromosome 14q. Intriguingly, 14q loss is
associated with a DNA hypermethylation phenotype, therapy resistance, and worsened outcomes in RCC
patients. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that L-2HG is a powerful epigenetic modifier that drives the
malignant phenotype of RCC. This hypothesis is based on strong preliminary data demonstrating that re-
expression of L2HGDH in RCC cells (and thus lowering of cellular L-2HG levels) can reverse epigenetic
modifications and suppresses both in vitro and in vivo tumor phenotypes. Additionally, high L-2HG tumors
from patients demonstrate a RCC hypermethylator phenotype. In Aim 1, we will dissect the genetic and
biochemical events that lead to L-2HG accumulation. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of L-2HG to
the hypermethylator phenotype and assess the effects on gene expression utilizing methodologies including
next generation sequencing with methylome array. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism by which
L2HGDH suppresses tumor growth. In addition, we will assess the role of L2HGDH loss in tumor initiation and
progression using novel genetic models. The proposed research is significant because it will identify the
drivers of the RCC epigenome in the context of targetable pathways. The approach is innovative because it
will establish a link between the epigenome and tumor metabolism in RCC. Ultimately, the knowledge
gathered has the potential to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with advanced RCC, an unmet need
challenging the contemporary management of this disease.","Project Narrative. The experiments of this proposal will facilitate our understanding of how metabolism alters
the kidney cancer epigenome and the effects on tumorigenesis. As new cancer therapies are emerging that
can target epigenetic and metabolic pathways, these studies can facilitate the development of novel
therapeutic approaches for one of the most common cancers in men and women.",2019,328423,233104,95319,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Kidney Disease; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases,SUNIL  SUDARSHAN
5R01AG057734-02,"Longevity assurance interventions, metabolic health and Alzheimer's Disease","The mechanisms responsible for the age dependence of the onset of neurodegeneration are
unknown, which represents a fundamental problem both in neuroscience and biogerontology.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by
dementia, deposition of beta amyloid (AÎ²) plaques, and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Despite
progress in developing treatments for the symptomatic relief of AD, most drugs only exhibit
marginal benefits and no cure currently exists. Epidemiological and preclinical studies provide
strong evidence that metabolic derangements including obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2
diabetes constitute major risk factors for age-related diseases including dementia and AD but
the mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.
 The GH signaling functions as a central regulator of metabolism and energy use, and it
coordinates the physiological responses of the entire organism through hormonal signaling.
Mutant animals with reduced GH signaling are not only long-lived, but are protected against
age-associated decline in memory and learning. Methionine restriction has been shown
previously to extend lifespan and delay aging in both rats and mice, dramatically decrease body
weight and adiposity, and improve insulin sensitivity and ameliorate aging-associated alterations
in glucose and lipid homeostasis. Thus, combing delaying aging models with AD disease
models exhibiting various phenotypic effects provides a novel opportunity to develop new
models that will allow studies focused on the interaction between aging, metabolism, and
neurodegeneration.
 Our proposed study will determine if suppression of the GH signaling and methionine
restriction will prevent development of behavioral, electrophysiological and histopathologic
abnormalities of AD phenotype can serve as a model to study the interaction of aging with AD,
providing a new level of analysis of the human brain in health and disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling is elevated under these conditions, which has been shown by the
investigators to be associated with inflammatory responses. Preliminary data has also shown that necrosis

collaborate with the investigators within the Research Center of Excellence in Arsenicals to identify and
prioritize novel molecular target-based approaches to develop countermeasures for mitigating the effects of skin
exposure to chemical vesicants. This will include the identification of novel small molecules that alleviate
cutaneous injury, pulmonary and renal toxicity and testing of these compounds in vivo. The approach proposed
herein will address the effective inhibition of several critical pathways and associated organ damage
simultaneously. The DDC has expertise in compound screening and assay development, involving novel and
diverse screening libraries which include over 4,000 FDA approved drugs. The core has a strong medicinal
chemistry component with extensive experience in lead optimization and drug discovery, including computational
and analytical chemistry and structural biology. Therefore, the major focus of these studies is on targeting novel
inhibitory compounds of BRD4 as potential antidotes of arsenicals. Given that some of these targets may have
tissue specificity (e.g., HO1 is critically associated with renal injury and is modulated in mice exposed to lewisite)
and simultaneous inhibition of multiple targets may provide a more effective approach, we will also identify
compounds affecting UPR, HO1 and RIP kinases. As compounds advance in in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic
studies, pharmaceutics/formulations and toxicology will be applied to the programs. These combined capabilities

1R21AI144507-01,Thiol mediated redox homeostasis in Haemophilus influenzae biofilms,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This application is for an RO1 project focused on defining determinants of bacterial persistence in
biofilms during otitis media infections. Otitis media is caused by airway opportunists such as Haemophilus
influenzae (Hi), which forms multicellular biofilm communities that promote bacterial persistence within the
middle-ear chamber. Over the past 15 years we have defined mechanism(s) involved in biofilm formation by
Hi, proved that biofilms promote bacterial persistence in vivo, and defined metabolic determinants of Hi
persistence within biofilm communities. Now, we plan to use this information to better understand the metabolic
state of Hi bacteria within biofilms, and to use that information to identify enzymes important to glutathione
mediated redox homeostasis to eradicate Hi bacteria within biofilms. In particular, we will ask how glutathione
contributes to Hi persistence in the face of chronic oxidative stress. We will complete the following Specific
Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To define role(s) for glutathione uptake and metabolism in Hi survival in biofilms.
Specific Aim 2. To test role(s) for glutathione mediated redox homeostasis in Hi persistence in vivo.
 Although it is clear that the biofilm mode of growth is involved in the majority of persistent infections,
much remains to be learned about the determinants of bacterial resistance to clearance within biofilms.
The completion of the proposed work will enhance our understanding of the role of biofilms within the
clinical context of otitis media.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

The UAB Predoctoral Training Program in Lung Diseases grant (â€œThe Programâ€) seeks to
develop outstanding biomedical scientists for a career in pulmonary research. This begins at an
early level of training, thus we have designed our program to focus on predoctoral trainees (n =
3 per year, each trainee having a 2 year training period). The Program is structured to provide
didactic education, training and mentoring via three avenues: (1) specific graduate coursework
on the (i) biology of lung diseases and (ii) respiratory physiology, (2) pairing of trainees with
clinical mentors in addition to their research mentors and (3) weekly exposure to lung-specific
basic, translational and clinical research and clinical medicine conferences. Training is further
supported by numerous enrichment activities via the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational
Sciences and the UAB Graduate School as well as an annual scientific retreat. The Program
has 24 primary research mentors divided into three broad areas of lung disease, (1) pneumonia
and asthma, (2) COPD, CF and lung injury and (3) IPF, BPD and pulmonary hypertension, and
spans five departments and both adult and pediatric Pulmonary Divisions. These primary
mentors have been chosen on the basis of research productivity, significant grant support,
collegiality and commitment to serve as predoctoral mentors. The Program is closely monitored
by a Program Director and Associate Director, a Steering Committee, an Internal Advisory
Committee and an External Advisory Committee (the latter two of which are predominantly
comprised of current institutional training grant Program Directors). Additional requirements for
each trainee include creating an individual development plan (IDP), participation in a Pulmonary
Research Core Curriculum that includes emerging themes such as signal transduction,
bioenergetics, â€œbig dataâ€ and computational biology and personalized medicine, and additional
coursework on professional communication skills and team management. A clinical perspective
will be stressed throughout the training period, which will be facilitated by a
pulmonologist/clinical mentor (n = 20) who will serve on a traineeâ€™s dissertation committee as
well as provide clinical experiences. Finally, the Program has strong institutional support from
UAB that includes financial support for program leadership and additional programmatic
development. This Program will capitalize on the recent growth in lung research at UAB and
foster high-level training experiences to develop the next generation of outstanding lung
researchers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01DC017137-01A1,Cognitive and Neural Basis of Functional Communication Deficits in Post-Stroke Aphasia,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aphasia is an impairment of language that is a common consequence of stroke and has serious negative
effects on health and well-being. Aphasia diagnosis continues to be organized around a 19th century model of
the neural basis of language, but cognitive neuroscience research over the last 15-20 years has converged to
a very different model of the cognitive and neural organization of spoken language. This contemporary model
provides a precise computational account of the sub-systems that support spoken language, but does not
explain how those sub-systems produce functional communication â€“ the outcome that is most important to
people with aphasia and to clinicians. The long-term goal of this project is to develop theory-informed,
clinically-relevant prognostic tools that combine behavioral and neuroimaging information. The overall objective
of this application is to determine the relationships between spoken functional communication impairments of
language sub-systems, and neuroanatomical disruption in chronic post-stroke aphasia. The overall project is
divided into three specific aims: (1) Determine how spoken functional communication is related to deficits in
language sub-systems. We will test how the three key language sub-systems â€“ semantics, phonology, and
sentence planning â€“ are related to functional communication in a large sample of individuals with post-stroke
aphasia. (2) Identify the lesion correlates of spoken functional communication deficits using lesion-symptom
mapping. We will conduct the first LSM study of spoken functional communication using multimodal
neuroimaging and machine learning tools to discover robust lesion correlates of spoken functional
communication. (3) Develop a prediction model of chronic language sub-system and functional communication
deficits based on acute lesion data. Routine clinical neuroimaging data collected in the acute stage (48-72
hours after stroke) will be used to build and evaluate a prediction model of chronic deficits in language sub-
systems and functional communication. Upon completion of this project, we will have determined how
behavioral deficits and lesion patterns are related to functional communication deficits, and developed a
prediction model of such deficits based on acute-stage clinical neuroimaging. This integration of
psycholinguistics, neuroanatomy, and functional communication will provide theory-informed, clinically-relevant
predictions of communication deficits. This project addresses NIDCD Strategic Priority Area 3 (Improving
Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention) by developing a neural biomarker of objective diagnosis and prognosis
for acquired language impairments.","Project Narrative
This project will integrate investigate how the cognitive and neural sub-systems that support
spoken language work together to allow speakers with language deficits to convey their

Bi-directional vesicular transport is vital in all eukaryotic cells to deliver proteins to secretory organelles

must traffic the secretory pathway. GBF1 (Golgi localized Brefeldin A-sensitive Factor1) is a key
regulator of retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, and GBF1 activity is required for the
establishment and maintenance of the secretory pathway. GBF1 belongs to a family of large Guanine
nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and is an enzyme that facilitates GDP/GTP exchange on the ARF
subfamily of small Ras-like GTPases. GBF1-mediated ARF activation is required for the formation of
retrograde COPI vesicles, and GBF1 represents an upstream regulator of COPI vesicle formation as it
dictates the time and site of vesicle formation by restricting ARF activation. Yet, despite the critical
importance of GBF1 in cellular homeostasis, we remain ignorant of how GBF1 itself is regulated in cells.
Specifically, we do not know how cells signal to GBF1 to â€œnotifyâ€ it of a cellular need for retrograde traffic
and what mechanisms ensure that GBF1 initiates COPI vesicle formation only at the right time and the
right place. This proposal aims to illuminate this enigma. We will test the hypothesis that cells have
mechanisms to inhibit GBF1 activity to prevent spurious ARF activation, but release such inhibition in a
time and site-restricted manner in response to a signaling pathway that indicates retrograde traffic
demand. Our goal is to define how cells translate their need for ARF activation and membrane transport

signaling pathways that regulate GBF1 function in an essential traffic routing in all cells, retrograde COPI
traffic that is vital for the homeostasis of the secretory pathway. In Aim 1, we will identify the mechanisms
that selectively target GBF1 to Golgi membranes by identifying the intrinsic targeting information within
GBF1 and the membrane components that mark membrane sites for GBF1 recruitment. In Aim 2, we will
define the mechanisms that regulate GBF1 catalytic activity at the membrane by assessing the role of
phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in regulating GBF1 catalytic activity. In Aim 3, we will determine
the signaling pathways that coordinate GBF1 function with the need for COPI traffic by defining the role
of KDEL-R activation and the PKA and SFK pathways on GBF1 membrane association and catalytic
activity. GBF1 is ubiquitously expressed and critically important to cell and organismal health; GBF1

5R21AI134282-02,Immunologic Health in Aging PLWH,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, routine care of persons living with HIV infection (PLWH)
requires extra attention to coinfections and comorbidities, as PLWH with impaired immunologic competency
(IIC) are prone to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. We propose that IIC is also the basis for accelerated/
premature aging (A/PA) in PLWH and that herpes zoster (shingles) can serve as a readily diagnosed sentinel
disease for studying molecular and immunologic correlates of A/PA. To prove these concepts, we have already
gathered compelling data from a Southeast US cohort of PLWH (N = 4,225) to demonstrate that relatively
young PLWH (30-55 years old) are already at high risk of developing herpes zoster, but recurrent herpes
zoster is relatively rare. New research can now focus on the disparity between biological age and chronological
age in PLWH and on the dynamics of immune protection against recurrent herpes zoster. Specifically, aim 1
will identify DNA methylation (epigenetic) age and molecular signatures of memory T-cells shortly before the
onset of herpes zoster, using high-throughput techniques to define genome-wide DNA methylation and gene
expression profiles. Aim 2 will compare virus-specific T-cell activation, proliferation and immune function after
co-culture with pools of immunogens derived from the varicella-zoster virus, using samples from two visits after
the first occurrence of herpes zoster. These studies will target two primary ethnic groups (African Americans
and European Americans) with disparate HIV/AIDS burdens and will properly account for potential confounders
(e.g., coinfections and comorbidities) as observed in a clinical setting. For further translation, analyses of DNA
methylation age (aim 1) should help with the design and implementation of interventional strategies for
alleviating or reversing IIC in diverse PLWH populations, including the application of a newly available
recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) against herpes zoster.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1U19AI142737-01,Development of novel reagents to identify xenograft reactive B cells,"Project 3: Development of Novel Reagents to Identify Xenograft Reactive B Cells
Project Summary
A shortage of available donor organs is the most critical challenge facing organ transplantation today. Pigs are
considered a promising source of replacement tissues. Unfortunately, xenotransplantation, the sharing of
organs across species, is not clinically applied because humans exert a strong humoral immune response
toward pig tissues. Our long-term goal has been to make pig tissues suitable for use in humans by preventing
the binding of human antibodies. The central hypothesis of this project is that pig Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) proteins, known as Swine Leukocyte Antigens (SLA) in the pig, contribute to xenoantigenicity.
We have shown that patients having antibodies against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) often cross-react
with the homologous SLA. We have also found that approximately 25% of the population who lack HLA
antibodies also have IgG and IgM capable of binding SLA. Inactivating SLA to eliminate their contribution to
human anti-pig immunity is problematic because the SLA are key to helping protect the organ from infection
and cancer. The objectives of this grant are to: (i) improve our understanding of the frequency with which
patients have anti-SLA antibodies; (ii) determine the origin of B cells which produce those antibodies, and (iii)
define their susceptibility to a B-cell depleting therapy (Rituximab). Our approach is innovative because it will
develop novel tools that build on similar approaches that have been successful in the setting of
allotransplantation. Our rationale is that this knowledge will bring us bring us closer to the use of pigs as an
organ source by helping to better match donors with recipients. In Specific Aim 1 we will create recombinant

Project Summary
Circulating lymphocytes are easy to access and therefore have been intensively studied in human beings. In
contrast, much less is known regarding the biology of tissue-resident human lymphocytes. This problem exists
because of limited access to sufficient quantities of human tissues. The overarching goal of this U19 Project
is to advance understanding of humoral immunity by evaluating B cells in eight different human tissues. Three
projects and three scientific cores will collaborate to examine the responses of B cells in these tissues against
bacterial, viral, and transplant antigens. Core B's objective is to eliminate the challenges associated with
human tissue access in support of the U19 goals. The organizational and operational structure of Core B is
innovative because a team with broad expertise (surgical, immunologic, cell biology, and biorepositories) will
be aligned with the Alabama Organ Center (AOC). The AOC manages deceased organ donors for the
purposes of tissue transplantation and is on the same campus as Core B. This structure will enable the
collection of tissues from approximately 19 human donors per year. Further, Core B will isolate, quality control
and store leukocytes in a biorepository. The rationale for this approach is that it will not only increase human
tissue access, it will standardize the isolation and storage of high-quality leukocytes. The repository
component will enable the projects and cores of this U19 to search this collection to find the ideal samples for
each experiment. This setup also facilitates the collaborative aspects of this U19 by enabling all projects to
understand which samples exist so that sharing can be prioritized to maximize sample value. In Specific Aim
1, we will collect tissues from deceased organ donors via the AOC. The objective of Specific Aim 2 is to
isolate and cryopreserve leukocytes from the tissues. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will establish a searchable
biorepository of these samples with which to support the research objectives of the U19. The activities of Core
B are significant because they will eliminate barriers that have prevented access to tissue-resident
lymphocytes, and they will enable the comparison of antigen-specific B cells in multiple tissues collected from
the same individual, as well as comparison to other individuals. Many of these investigations will be entirely
novel.",,2019,323745,218010,105735,Non-SBIR/STTR,U19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation,Matthew F.

5R01AI132579-04,Nano-carrier Formulations for Targeted Drug Delivery and Malaria Radical Cure,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Development of dormant hypnozoites in the hepatic tissues, which may cause malaria relapse weeks to
months after the initial infection, poses the major challenge for treatment & control of vivax malaria. 8-
Aminoquinolines (8-AQs) are the only antimalarial drugs active against Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites. However,
the utility of 8-AQs has been limited due to a dose-limiting hemolytic toxicity in individuals with glucose-6-
phosphate dehyrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency affects more than 400 million people worldwide
Lipid/polymeric nanoparticle formulations have recently been shown to have significant oral bioavailability. This
approach, along with targeted delivery to the hepatic tissues may be applied for improving therapeutic index of
8-AQs. The goal of this project would be to develop stable lipid nanoparticles [solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) or
nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs)] loaded with primaquine or NPC1161B, which can permeate across the
intestinal epithelia, reach the blood circulation and distribute in the tissues intact following oral administration.
 Targeted and non-targeted nano-carrier formulations (polymeric, lipid based and micellar) of PQ and
NPC1161B will be prepared and optimized for pharmaceutical properties. Lipid-based nanoparticles will be
prepared by high-pressure homogenization technique using glyceryl stearate, glyceryl distearate, glyceryl
behenate, miglyol and other GRAS listed, biocompatible and biodegradable lipids, and their combinations. The
formulations will be evaluated with respect to drug loading, loading efficiency, particle size and size distribution,
zeta potential, resistance to lipolysis, in vitro drug release rates, physical and chemical stability, uptake and
metabolism by primary human hepatocytes. In vivo pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in rodents will
assess the liver/blood ratios of the drugs and characterize their metabolism and plasma/liver pharmacokinetics.
The formulations with desired PK and metabolism profiles would be progressed to in vivo efficacy in rodent
malaria blood and liver stage causal prophylaxis models. In vivo hemotoxicity will be evaluated in the recently
developed humanized NOD-SCID mouse model engrafted with human G6PD deficient blood.
 Targeted orally bioavailable nano-carrier formulations of PQ and NPC1161B will reduce total dose of the
drug required for complete efficacy, which presumably would translate to ""a higher total dose of active metabolite
in parasitized liver cells"" required to clear vivax hypnozoites. Reduced exposure of erythrocytes to the drug or
the metabolites would improve therapeutic index of these drugs and allow their safe use in G6D deficient
individuals. This would also allow application of these drugs for public health and malaria control programs.","Project Narrative
This project addresses a critical unmet medical need for a safer antimalarial drug for malaria radical cure.
Relapsing vivax malaria is a global health challenge. Primaquine, the only drug available for malaria radical cure,
poses severe safety issues in populations with G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency affects more than 400 million
individuals worldwide. NPC1161B has been identified as an enantiomerically pure 8-aminoquinoline analogs
with improved therapeutic profile.
Nano-carrier formulations of PQ and NPC1161B will be developed and evaluated through the preclinical models
recently developed by us. The oral nano-carrier formulations shall reduce total dose of the drug by delivering ""a

5P50AR060772-08,Project 1: AMPK and Inflammation in Gout,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
In gout, acute arthritis flares are often severe, and impair quality of life. Acute gout flares increase early, and 
persist for years, in the titration and first years of maintenance of otherwise successful urate-lowering therapy 
(ULT). Yet symptomatic gout manifests variably in established gout. Furthermore, gout does not uniformly 
develop in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, despite detectable tissue urate crystal deposits in ~25%. Serum urate 
(sUA) level helps guide clinical decision-making, eg, ULT to specific sUA target, or to identify ULT efficacy 
(monitoring biomarker). sUA fulfills criteria for gout surrogate biomarker, as a surrogate end point in clinical 
trials. However, sUA has no clear role in assessing the inflammatory state in gout. As such, there is major 
unmet need for better biomarkers not only for incident gout in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, but also for which 
gout patients will develop more frequent and severe flares, and thereby, to advance gout precision medicine 
(CORT theme), by predicting need and duration, and monitor effectiveness of potentially toxic gout flare 
colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis, particularly after starting and maintaining ULT. Our scientific premise directly 
addresses these needs, building on our recent discovery that the metabolic energy biosensor AMP activated 
Kinase (AMPK) controls ""on and off switches"" for model gouty inflammation. Remarkably, AMPK also is a 
primary transducer of therapeutic effects of colchicine and methotrexate. Moreover, we present striking 
Preliminary Studies for attenuated PBL AMPK activity in gout compared to healthy controls. Here, we will 
translate basic findings that constitutive AMPK activity markedly limits the inflammatory potential of urate 
crystals in vivo, partly by blunting activation of the inflammation master regulator NF-ÎºB, and by limiting urate 
crystal NLRP3 inflammasome activation/IL-1Î² release by macrophages. Significantly, AMPK activity both 
regulates and reflects nutrition, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory stressors, with tissue AMPK 
activity known to be diminished in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Significantly, low AMPK 
activity promotes common gout comorbid conditions (CORT theme), ie, hypertension, CKD onset, progression 
and associated renal fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis. To test the hypothesis 
that low AMPK activity predicts more frequent and severe inflammatory gouty arthritis flares, we will assay PBL 
AMPK activity, and specific AMPK-targeted metabolites (assessed by metabolomics) in gout, healthy controls, 
and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We will perform an ancillary study of gout subjects in the VA CSP594 
comparative effectiveness study of titrated allopurinol vs. febuxostat ULT, titrated to urate target, but with flares 
at 72 weeks as the primary endpoint. We also will test the hypothesis that, in gout, low PBL AMPK activity is a 
marker for patients with greater than the median inflammatory flares/year, and for increased NF-ÎºB activity. 
Project completion will translate metabolic regulation of inflammation to a novel biomarker and target for 
preventing acute gout flares.",,2019,224324,175798,48526,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Arthritis; Clinical Research,Robert A. Terkeltaub
5R21DC016375-04,Understanding cognitive and neurobiological factors of age-related speech recognition declines,"Older adults, even those with relatively normal hearing, have trouble recognizing speech in background noise. Consequently, older adults often have difficulty engaging in normal conversations and therefore experience a diminished quality of life. In order to adequately remedy such communication impairments, we need to understand factors beyond the peripheral auditory system that impact communication in older adults. In particular, inhibitory control, the ability to suppress irrelevant information, may help the listener ignore background noise and facilitate identification of a target word by inhibiting similar-sounding but inappropriate alternatives. The goal of this project is to better understand the role of inhibitory control in speech recognition by 1) delineating the neural mechanisms that support speech recognition in noise for older adults with varying inhibitory control abilities and 2) driving the inhibitory control system to assess its direct impact on moment-to- moment word recognition. This project will inform the rehabilitation of communication in the aging adult population by investigating how inhibitory control contributes to understanding speech in noise.
This proposal aims to determine how the availability and moment-to-moment recruitment of inhibitory control affects speech recognition in noise among older adults. Stimulus competition will be used to induce inhibitory control in older adults with high versus low inhibitory control in order to characterize the support of neural systems for speech recognition on a subsequent trial using fMRI. Using the phenomenon of conflict adaptation, wherein competing information leads to the recruitment of inhibitory control and boosts performance on subsequent trials, this project will determine the extent to which experiencing audiovisual conflict increases correct word identification. Moreover, by comparing performance and neural activity in adults with high versus low inhibitory control, this study will investigate the extent to which reduced inhibitory control contributes to age-related declines in speech comprehension.
The results of this research will advance our understanding of how inhibitory control supports speech recognition in older adults. The results are expected to identify novel methods to enhance communication and identify individuals who will most benefit from treatments for hearing loss and who may require inhibitory control training as an intervention to improve speech comprehension.","This research will elucidate the role of inhibitory control in speech recognition in older adults, 
thereby increasing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the perception and

5P01HL114470-07,Therapeutic Targeting of the Myofibroblast in Fibrotic Lung Disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fibrosis involving the airways, vasculature, alveoli, and pleura is seen, to varying degrees, in a number of
clinical syndromes, including asthma, subphenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary
hypertension, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is the most enigmatic and fatal of the fibrotic lung
disorders. Despite the recent approval of two drugs, survival has not significantly improved. Pulmonary
fibrosis represents a complex tissue response to lung injury that involves a number of cell types, mediators,
and signaling pathways. In just over the last few years, several new concepts in disease pathogenesis have
emerged; these include metabolic reprogramming, epigenetics, immune modulation, macrophage biology and
the invasive/apoptosis-resistant phenotype of myofibroblasts (myoFbs). Each of these concepts/paradigms is
addressed in this renewal application of this tPPG. Work conducted during Cycle I of this tPPG has validated
the pro-fibrotic effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-regenerating enzyme, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4),
and identified circulating plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress in human subjects with IPF. In Project 1, we
will conduct a Phase IIb clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of a NOX1/4 inhibitor in IPF using multiple
biomarkers and physiologic measures as primary and secondary end-points. Project 2 will test the hypothesis
that redox-metabolic reprogramming of myoFbs accounts for the observed pro-fibrotic effects of NOX4. Based
on emerging data on macrophage-myoFb interactions in fibrosis, Project 3 will test the hypothesis that NOX4
modulates macrophage mitochondrial ROS and metabolism to polarize alveolar macrophages to a pro-fibrotic
phenotype. Project 4 will test the novel hypothesis that B-cell derived autoantibodies epigenetically reprogram
Fbs to an anti-apoptotic phenotype. Together, this tPPG will elucidate critical links between cellular redox
control and metabolic reprogramming, uncover novel regulatory mechanisms of macrophage polarization, and
illuminate previously unrecognized connections between innate/adaptive immunity, epigenetics and lung
fibrosis. Importantly, this tPPG will advance a novel anti-fibrotic drug therapy that more specifically targets
redox biology in IPF, which will enable future Phase III clinical trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5I01BX003056-04,Sirtuins in Lung Aging and Fibrosis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   
   
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of aging. IPF carries a high morbidity and mortality, with a median survival rate of less than three years. The incidence and prevalence of IPF increase drastically with age; however, despite this strong association, cellular/molecular mechanisms that account for the aging predilection to fibrotic disease have not been elucidated.  Recent studies from our laboratory have identified a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4), in mediating differentiation of fibroblasts (Fbs) to myofibroblasts (MFbs), key effectors of fibrogenesis, and in in-vivo lung fibrosis in murine models of lung injury. Our preliminary studies indicate that the biological actions of Nox4 may be modulated by the expression of SIRT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin. Both cellular senescence and TGF-Î²1 mediate suppression of SIRT3; our preliminary studies support a role for epigenetic silencing of SIRT3 involving both DNA methylation and histone modification. Decreased expression of SIRT3 promotes a senescent and pro-fibrotic Fb phenotype. TGF-Î²1-induced down-regulation of SIRT3 is associated with hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, supporting a role for altered mitochondrial bioenergetics in MFbs. Human subjects with IPF express low levels of SIRT3 in myofibroblastic foci (by immunohistochemistry), as well as in ex-vivo Fbs isolated from IPF lungs. We have developed a novel aging model of non-resolving fibrosis in mice; fibrosis in young mice (2 months) resolves by >50% by 4 months post-bleomycin, whereas aged mice (18 months) show persistent fibrotic response. While SIRT3 levels decrease during the fibrogenic phase in both groups, young mice demonstrate a capacity to recover SIRT3 levels during resolution; in contrast, aged mice manifest sustained down-regulation of SIRT3.  The central hypothesis to be tested in this grant proposal is that, in the context of aging, lung injury results in sustained, epigenetically-regulated SIRT3 silencing that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, MFb senescence and apoptosis resistance, leading to persistent fibrosis with aging.  Our specific aims are to: (1) determine epigenetic mechanisms for SIRT3 down-regulation with cellular senescence and with TGF-Î²1 signaling in lung Fbs; (2) determine the role of SIRT3 in regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, Fb senescence and apoptosis resistance; (3) determine whether whole-animal SIRT3 knockout and/or conditional genetic deletion of SIRT3 in collagen-producing/mesenchymal cells induce(s) persistent fibrosis in young mice.  The completion of the Aims in this proposal will: (a) elucidate epigenetic mechanisms that control SIRT3 expression with cellular senescence/aging; (b) provide mechanistic insights into the role of SIRT3 in maintenance of mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular plasticity/fate; (c) provide proof-of-concept that SIRT3 induction in the context of age-associated fibrosis facilitates fibrosis resolution, uncovering a novel therapeutic approach to non-resolving fibrotic disorders such as IPF.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

5P01HL114470-07,Redox Regulation of Metabolic Reprogramming in Activated Myofibroblasts,"ABSTRACT
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is chronic, progressive lung disorder with high mortality, and limited
therapeutic options. Studies performed during Cycle I of this translational PPG (tPPG) have uncovered a
critical role for redox imbalance in activated myofibroblasts (myo-Fbs) that may drive disease progression in
IPF. In animal models of lung fibrosis, targeting the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating enzyme,
NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4), by genetic approaches or by a pharmacologic approach (GKT137831, to be tested
in Phase IIb clinical trial, see Project 1) protects from fibrosis. Recent studies by UAB-tPPG investigators have
discovered a metabolic reprogramming of myo-Fbs characterized by elevated aerobic glycolysis (aGLY), and
mitochondrial dysfunction. Our data demonstrate that the pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-Î²1
(TGF-Î²1), induces generation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites, including succinate and fumarate,
which are known to stabilize/activate hypoxia-inducible factor 1ï¡ (HIF-1ï¡) (7-9). Our preliminary studies show
that TGF-Î²1-induced activation of HIF-1ï¡ is inhibited in Fbs with genetic deletion in NOX4 (NOX4-/-).
Additionally, we have established a novel 3D-spheroid tissue culture system that provides a complementary
approach to test for myo-Fb invasiveness and screen for anti-fibrotic compounds in a patient-specific manner.
Paracrine effects of activated macrophages (see Project 3) and B-lymphocytes (see Project 4) are critical in
regulating Fb and myo-Fbs phenotypes; however, the roles of NOX enzymes and potential for metabolic
reprogramming of myo-Fbs by these cell types are not well understood.
 The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that NOX4 mediates fibrogenic effects by metabolic
reprogramming that involves mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of TCA cycle metabolites to confer an
invasive and apoptosis-resistant phenotype to myo-Fbs, thus, impeding fibrosis resolution. The specific aims
to be tested are: (1) to determine whether the NOX4 expression and/or the invasive capacity of Fbs is
predictive of severity and/or progression of IPF; and to characterize the heterogeneity in responses to anti-
fibrotic drugs; (2) to determine the mechanisms by which NOX4 metabolically reprograms myo-Fbs to induce
apoptosis resistance and invasion; and determine whether these pro-fibrotic myo-Fb phenotypes are
modulated by activated macrophages and/or B-cells; and (3) to determine whether the protective effect of
genetic/pharmacologic NOX4 inhibition in animal models of fibrosis is mediated by reversal of pro-fibrotic
metabolic programs.
 These completion of these studies will: (a) link the biology of NOX4 with metabolic reprogramming; (b)
provide new insights into the role of intermediary metabolism in determining fibrotic gene expression and pro-
fibrotic cellular phenotypes; and (c) utilize novel 3D-spheroid tissue culture models to study cell invasion, to
phenotype multi-cellular disease processes, and to assess responsiveness to specific drug therapies.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01AI123162-04,Intersection of polyomavirus infection and host cellular responses,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polyomaviruses cause a variety of severe human diseases particularly in immunocompromised individuals. No specific anti-viral treatments or prophylactic approaches exist to target this family of viruses. There are several critical gaps in our current knowledge of the molecular mechanism of viral replication and tumorigenesis. Our long-term goals are to identify how these viruses subvert normal host cellular processes to facilitate viral replication, and how these interactions may result in oncogenesis. Our previous studies revealed an intricate balanced relationship between viral replication and virus-induced host genomic instability. These results lead to our central hypothesis that an activated cellular DNA damage response (DDR) is important for facilitating viral replication and maintaining host genome stability during polyomavirus infection. Towards this hypothesis, we have identified host mismatch repair system and replicating viral DNA as novel factors contributing to DDR activation. We have also discovered that the ability of polyomavirus to cause host genomic DNA damage is linked to its ability to replicate viral DNA. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to characterize DDR activation mechanism and how the DDR ties together viral replication and host genomic stability: (1) To define the role of host mismatch repair proteins in polyomavirus replication and polyomavirus-induced DDR activation. (2) To determine the viral DNA triggers that activate the DDR upon polyomavirus infection. (3) To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which polyomavirus induces host genome instability. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field by characterizing the essential roles that the DDR plays in promoting viral replication and maintaining host genome stability. These studies will have the potential to uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying polyomavirus replication as well as viral oncogenesis. These findings may be extrapolated to other DNA viruses and to our understanding of normal cellular processes.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Polyomaviruses are a family of viruses associated with severe human diseases and a subset of them can also cause cancers.

4R00MH110603-03,Functional Analysis of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to investigate the functions of schizophrenia-associated genes using zebrafish as a
model system. Large-scale genome-wide association studies have begun to uncover numerous candidate
genes linked to schizophrenia. Yet it remains unclear how these genes function and how they contribute to the
underlying molecular, cellular, developmental and behavioral processes disrupted in the disorder. Recent
technological breakthroughs in zebrafish â€“ targeted genome editing, whole-brain activity imaging, brain atlas
registration, behavioral profiling â€“ combined with the ease of studying large numbers of animals make it an
ideal system for analyzing psychiatric disease genes. Preliminary studies led to the creation of zebrafish
mutants for 96 schizophrenia-associated genes. Characterization of 59 of these mutants for altered brain
anatomy and activity has revealed 27 mutants with phenotypical abnormalities. In particular, ZNF536, a
schizophrenia-associated transcription factor, was found to be involved in the development of GABAergic
inhibitory neurons in the forebrain and cerebellum as well as regulate locomotion. During the K99 phase, this
project will complete the analysis of mutant brain anatomy. In addition, all mutants will be tested for behavioral
abnormalities, including motor behaviors associated with schizophrenia, such as defective prepulse inhibition
(Aim 1). In parallel, the developmental roles of ZNF536 will be studied to test the hypothesis that this
transcription factor is responsible for the development of GABAergic neurons, and that its loss results in the
de-inhibition of downstream circuits. To define the molecular mechanisms by which ZNF536 exerts its effects,
ZNF536 target genes will be isolated (Aim 2). Similar in-depth characterization of other interesting genes will
be undertaken in the R00 phase to discover additional pathways regulated by schizophrenia-associated genes.

The goal of this project is to provide the candidate with the necessary skills and training to become an
independent clinician-scientist in the field of ocular surface mucin glycobiology. The applicant will learn
methodologies to analyze high molecular weight O-glycosylated ocular mucins. Analysis of these
mucins is challenging due to the extensive branching and numerous glycan attachments and is
compounded by the limited sample size obtainable in vivo. Therefore, training of the applicant in this
field would be highly valuable and beneficial to the ocular surface community. Mucins on the ocular
surface are found both in the tear film and attached to the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva to primarily
lubricate the eye. Membrane associated mucins (MAMs) in the conjunctiva form the glycocalyx which is
important for hydrophilic attraction of the tears. In dry eye disease (DED), there are changes in the
expression of mucins in the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva that contribute to its pathogenesis. While
dryness on the ocular surface is thought to lead to increased friction during blinking, the impact of
dryness on the epithelial cell physiology of the inner surfaces of the eyelid (palpebral conjunctiva) is
unclear. Experiments in Aim 1 will determine whether MAMs MUC1 and MUC16 are present in the
palpebral conjunctiva. Experiments in Aim 2 will compare gene expression and protein levels of MUC1
and MUC16 in the palpebral conjunctivas of humans with moderate to severe DED. Finally,
experiments in Aim 3 will investigate the affinity of MUC16 for galectin-3 in the glycocalyx. Aims 1 and
2 will use real time quantitative PCR analysis to detect expression of MUC1 and MUC16. The cell
samples will be collected using a technique known as impression cytology and then processed for gene
expression and protein quantification. Aim 3 will utilize an adapted slot blot affinity assay to analyze the
affinity of MUC16 for galectin-3, a lectin that associates with MUC16 in the glycocalyx and contributes
to its barrier function. To accomplish these aims, the applicant has assembled a strong mentoring team.
The primary mentor, Dr. Jason Nichols, has an extensive history of clinical research, mentoring
experiences, and analytical expertise. The co-mentor, Dr. Pablo ArgÃ¼eso, has been researching ocular
surface mucins for over a decade and knows the intricacies involved with analysis of these
glycoproteins. This K23 supported research will form the foundation for future research into the
glycobiological basis of dry eye disease and the impact of ocular inflammation on mucins.","Project Narrative & Public Health Relevance
Dry eye disease affects millions of people worldwide and due to an incomplete understanding of
the pathogenesis of the disease, it is widely underdiagnosed and undermanaged by clinicians.
Understanding the contribution of the proteins involved in maintaining boundary lubrication
between the ocular surface and eyelids, specifically mucins, may lead to better understanding of
disease and potentially to earlier diagnosis of dry eye. The development of treatments targeted
to reinstate balance of mucins on the ocular surface and eyelids may provide effective relief of
symptoms and reduce the burden of ocular surface diseases.",2019,35537,32905,2632,Other Research-Related,K23,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF OPTOMETRY/OPHT TECH,352940001,Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision,Anna A. Tichenor

5U01HL120338-05,Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy-CHAP Clinical Coordinating Center,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Chronic hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) project is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic treatment of mild chronic hypertension (CHTN) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, CHTN is the most common major medical disorder, most often mild (BP <160/110 mmHg), and associated with a 3-5 fold increase in adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, perinatal death, preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birth weight <10th percentile). Whereas antihypertensive therapy is a public health priority for the general population, authorities, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommend against BP lowering therapy during pregnancy unless hypertension is severe, i.e., e160/110 mm Hg, because of uncertain benefits and the concern that therapy may actually increase the risk of SGA. Based on supportive preliminary data presented herein, we hypothesize that antihypertensive therapy for CHTN during pregnancy to the goal <140/90 mmHg as currently recommended for the non-pregnant hypertensive population, will reduce the risk of several adverse pregnancy outcomes including SGA. During a 6-year project period, our consortium of 12 academic perinatal centers (25 sites), will identify 4700 women with mild CHTN and BP<155/100 mmHg (which providers are more comfortable not treating) in early pregnancy and randomize them to either antihypertensive therapy (using labetalol) or to management according to ACOG recommendations (antihypertensive therapy for more severe CHTN). The women will be followed-up until discharge from the {hospital after delivery and up to 3 months postpartum (longer follow-up is anticipated separately; contingency funds will be considered for interim 6-month phone call). The following Specific Aims will be addressed: } {1.1 Primary Aim: To determine if pharmacologic treatment of mild CHTN in pregnancy to a standardized BP} goal<140/90 mmHg, compared with standard management (per ACOG: no treatment unless hypertension is severe), reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including: 1) a severe perinatal composite outcome (perinatal death, severe preeclampsia, placental abruption or indicated PTB <35 weeks) and 2) SGA. 1.2 Secondary Aims: i. To better quantify the risks of severe maternal cardiovascular outcomes associated with mild CHTN during pregnancy and determine the impact of treatment. ii. To investigate the optimal gestational age to deliver women with CHTN in order to minimize maternal and perinatal complications. We will apply survival analysis methods to the trial population. iii. To collect and store biospecimens including maternal blood, cord blood and placentas for future biological and biophysical studies to understand the effects of antihypertensive therapy in pregnant women with mild CHTN. iv. To assess whether antihypertensive treatment of mild CHTN during pregnancy increases post-pregnancy adherence to recommended therapy.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) Project is a large pragmatic multi-center randomized trial designed primarily to evaluate the benefits and harms of antihypertensive therapy for mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy to a goal <140/90 mmHg (as recommended for the general population in the US) compared with ACOG's current policy to withhold treatment unless hypertension is severe. The trial will be conducted in 12 experienced research-oriented Ob/Gyn departments (including 25 clinical sites) in the United States.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) submits this application to renew our participation as a clinical center of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network. We present our center's ongoing record of exceptional performance overall and specify new attributes and our plans to increase our contributions to the Network's goals of investigating major problems in clinical obstetrics, particularly those related to low birth weight prematurity, obstetric and medical complications of pregnancy. We have a well-established research infrastructure and extensive experience in performing relevant clinical trials and observational studies both within and outside the MFMU Network. As a Network participating center over the last five 5-year cycles, UAB has consistently played a leadership role in providing research direction for the Network at the Steering Committee and sub-committee levels (one UAB-led trial starting and 2 other protocols approved), conducted Network trials with the highest efficiency of any center, and participated significantly in the presentation and publication of data generated. Among 31 clinical centers in the history of the Network, a UAB investigator has first-authored approximately 54 (19.5%) of 277 current MFMU Network publications. Of 453 total Network presentations at national meetings, a UAB investigator presented 19.6%. Current members of the UAB site MFM team have accumulated well over 200 person-years' experience of active participation in support of MFMU research projects; our current research staff similarly cumulate over 250 MFMU person-years. Alan Tita, MD, PhD and Joseph Biggio, MD will continue as PI and Alternate PI, respectively. The investigative team includes two previous site PI's and 7 members who have served or currently serve as Network protocol chairpersons (Dr. Biggio currently for the 3- arm trial to evaluate pessary and vaginal progesterone for PTB prevention in twins - PROSPECT) or Subcommittee members (Dr. Tita is currently on Publications Committee and ALPS and ARRIVE protocol subcommittees; Dr. Biggio is also on the subcommittee of the APPS trial - pessary vs. vaginal progesterone for singleton short cervix study protocol). Finally, on the basis of patient recruitment, protocol adherence, retention and follow-up, data quality, and study start-up time, the MFMU Network Data Coordinating Center ranked us #1 or #2 among the participating centers 71% (10/14) of the time since 2003 (#1 overall, 53% of the time). If successful, in this competitive renewal application, we will deploy our facilities, equipment, data management systems (including our electronic perinatal record system), recruitment resources, reinforced investigative team and highly experienced personnel even more to develop and implement MFMU Network protocols and projects. We believe that we remain well positioned for competitive renewal as an NICHD MFMU Network center for the next five years. We outline plans to potentially expand our target population to at least one ancillary site during the next cycle after appropriate evaluation by the
NICHD and Data Coordinating Center.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): By continuing to participate in this ongoing multicenter collaborative research program, UAB researchers will help discover new and useful methods to treat and/or prevent major public health problems affecting pregnant women and their infants.

5R01CA204346-03,Early life prevention of breast cancer with combined epigenetic botanicals,"Use of dietary botanicals for maintaining health can be greatly enhanced through elucidation of their effects on
epigenetic mechanisms, their combined impact and their efficacy at different life stages, especially early in life.
Epigenetic aberrations often alter key gene expressions that are crucial in maintaining health and delaying the
onset and reducing the impact of cancer. However, very little is known with respect to the impact of dietary
botanicals consumed in combination early in life on epigenetic mechanisms and the risk of developing cancer.
Our studies have indicated that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and sulforaphane (SFN)-rich broccoli sprouts
(BSp), administered in combination at safe levels consumable by humans, are highly effective in increasing
cancer latency in mice that spontaneously develop estrogen receptor (ER)-negative [ER(-)] breast cancer and
that this may be more effective when administered early in life. It is important that although most ER(+) breast
cancer is relatively highly responsive to therapy once it forms, ER(-) breast cancer has high mortality rates if it
is not prevented from developing. Therefore, cancer prevention approaches that reduce ER(-) breast cancer
will have by far the greatest impact on the incidence of cancer fatalities. Our results indicate that the efficacy
of this dietary approach depends on the ability of these botanicals to significantly impact epigenetic gene
regulation. Our hypothesis is that early life consumption of combined GTPs and BSp is highly effective in
neutralizing epigenomic alterations and epigenetic control of key genes that lead to ER(-) BC formation and
progression. These studies will be important to determine the efficacy of botanicals at various stages of life so
that their consumption will optimize the potential for cancer prevention. We do not yet fully understand the
epigenetic mechanisms of these botanicals consumed at different stages of life and especially in combination
as they are often consumed. Further, the impact of these botanicals on global epigenomic processes at
various ages is not yet known. A major goal of this proposed investigation is to confront these persistent
challenges. The incorporation of these botanicals into diets of the young is safe and could lead to important
revisions of dietary regimens to increase cancer latency and to significantly reduce the incidence of ER(-)
breast cancer fatalities. Novel techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-genomic bisulfite sequencing
(ChIP-GBS) that we invented as well as several advanced epigenomic technologies will be employed.
Elucidation of the epigenetic mechanisms for cancer latency and reducing the risk of cancer will result in
significant increases in the health of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide. This investigation will
also provide essential information for identification of epigenetic biomarkers of breast cancer at different stages
of life that will facilitate elucidation of the predisposition, diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Most
importantly, the use of safe and effective epigenetic aberration-neutralizing botanicals in early life has high
translational potential for increasing the latency and reducing the impact of ER(-) breast cancer.","Public Health Relevance Statement:

1F31DK120217-01A1,The role of Ldb1 in regulating pancreatic islet cell delamination and differentiation,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic islets are comprised of five hormone-secreting cell types and are vital regulators of glucose
homeostasis in mammals. Specifically, glucagon producing Î±-cells and insulin producing b-cells act
synchronously to tightly regulate blood glucose and allow for normal metabolic function in tissues. During
diabetes, loss of functional b-cell mass leads to severe complications in suffering patients. With diagnoses of
diabetes rising at an alarming rate worldwide, key to future diabetes treatments is a greater
understanding of the transcriptional complexes mediating not only early b-cell, but whole islet
differentiation and formation. The first step of specification of all islet cells is the delamination of endocrine
progenitors (marked by Neurogenin3, Ngn3) out of the ductal epithelium through a process known as epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by the Snail2 transcription factor. This step occurs as early as
embryonic day (E)10.5 in mice and is absolutely required for formation of mature islets. Our lab previously
showed that a transcriptional co-regulator, LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1) is required for pancreatic
development at various stages. In a pancreas-wide Ldb1 knockout, we observed disrupted progenitor pools at
E13.5, and a severe loss of Ngn3+ endocrine progenitors at E15.5. Upon birth, these mice lack islet structures,
highlighting the importance of Ldb1 in the development of endocrine cells and formation of islet structures.
Additionally, these neonatal mutant mice exhibited an abnormal clustering of immature endocrine cells along the
ducts. This observation, plus the loss of Ngn3+ cells, suggests that there is a delamination defect during
development. For this training plan, I propose to investigate the role of Ldb1 in pancreatic endocrine
progenitor delamination and the mechanisms by which Ldb1 complexes impart their effects. My
overarching hypothesis is that Ldb1 is required for development of the endocrine progenitor population. In Aim
1, I will determine the contribution of Ldb1 to endocrine progenitor delamination, by assessing canonical EMT
markers throughout development, as well as lineage tracing to determine the fate of endocrine progenitors in the
absence of Ldb1. In Aim 2, I will characterize Ldb1-mediated regulatory mechanisms, with a focus on Ldb1
regulation of Ngn3 and Snail2. I will use Chromatin ImmunoPreciptation (ChIP)-Seq to determine targets directly
bound by Ldb1, and RNA-Seq to gain insight into the genome-wide effects of Ldb1 loss in endocrine progenitors.
A greater understanding of transcriptional control of EMT in the developing pancreas gained from this research
will provide a deeper understanding of how islets arise, benefiting future diabetes therapies, including directed
stem cell differentiation strategies.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Diabetes Mellitus is an ever-growing disease that results from functional pancreatic b-cell loss, causing severe
and life-threatening complications in suffering patients. Importantly, b-cells do not function alone but in structures
called islets that are crucial for regulation of blood glucose. Understanding the transcriptional regulation that
dictates initial appearance, development, and formation of these islet structures will lead to enhancement of our
ability to design cell-based treatments to improve diabetic quality of life and survival.",2019,43736,43736,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Diabetes; Genetics,Eliana  Toren
5P01HL066299-17,Calcium microdomains regulating pulmonary endothelial permeability,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have previously identified distinct functional outcomes in lung alveolar septal endothelium on activation of
TRPV4, a Ca channel in the vanilloid transient receptor potential family, or the ï¡1G T-type voltage-gated Ca
2+ 2+
channel. Despite equivalent whole-cell Ca2+ transients in the extremely thin septal endothelium, TRPV4 only
increases endothelial permeability while the T-channel only increases endothelial surface expression of P-
selectin. As a result, we propose a critical paradigm shift, from a global perspective of Ca2+-dependent
signaling to one where Ca2+ microdomains, orchestrated by mitochondrial-dependent Ca2+ buffering, are
organized to yield discrete functional outcomes within lung microvascular endothelial cells. Our preliminary
data suggest discrete localization of these Ca2+channels and distribution of mitochondria even into the
attenuated cell periphery in lung microvascular endothelium in situ. Further, we have documented that
mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction leads to loss of domain constraints with greater spread and duration of
TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ transients and increased endothelial permeability in lung microvascular endothelium.
Collectively, these observations led us to the HYPOTHESIS that in lung microvascular endothelium,
mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering constrains Ca2+ influx via TRPV4 or the T-type channel to spatially delimited
cytosolic microdomains yielding specificity of functional outcomes, constraints lost with mitochondrial
dysfunction. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are to: 1) determine the contribution of mitochondria to buffering of the
spatial spread, dynamics and functional specificity of Ca2+ signals on activation of TRPV4 or T-type Ca2+
channels, and 2) determine the extent to which mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction decreases the threshold
for and specificity of functional outcomes on activation of TRPV4 or T-type Ca2+ channels. We will utilize
innovative high-speed hyperspectral excitation scanning imaging and novel analytical tools to detect and
interpret signal dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. These data will be interpreted in context of
localized functional outcomes, in naÃ¯ve endothelium, in endothelium after disruption of mitochondrial-
dependent buffering and after initiation of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction in the intact lung with
hyperoxia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis. We predict that such dysfunction will lead to blurring
of specificity for Ca2+ signaling, altering the set point from which lung endothelium interprets Ca2+ signaling with
mechanical stress. This work will provide the first insight into mechanisms underlying Ca2+ microdomains in
lung microvascular endothelium. To accomplish this, we have assembled an outstanding team with expertise
spanning from structural and functional determinants of endothelial permeability, development and use of novel
tools, and modeling of signaling domains/networks to bioenergetics and sepsis.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Calcium entry into lung endothelium has traditionally been viewed as causing homogeneous all or none
responses. In contrast, this project will test the idea that mitochondria play a key role in limiting calcium signals
from disparate calcium channels to discrete functions in lung endothelial cells. We predict that this specificity
will be lost with mitochondrial dysfunction in hyperoxia and sepsis, increasing susceptibility to inflammation and
to lung injury with mechanical stress.",2019,357868,232382,125486,Non-SBIR/STTR,P01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,Domestic Higher Education,366880002,Lung,MARY I TOWNSLEY

UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC), have established Administrative Cores. As part of the
currently active U54, at each of the three institutions, an efficient administrative infrastructure is in place. The
primary objectives of this core are for coordination, communication, budgetary oversight, and clerical functions
associated with the overall research program proposed in this grant application. The Partnership has four
Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Planning & Evaluation, and Research Education), Research Projects (two
Full Projects and a Pilot Project), and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). The
Partnership Administrative Core, which is responsible for administrative management of Partnership-wide
activities, is comprised of the institution-specific Executive Committees (ECs), the Partnership Leadership
Committee (PLC), the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The
ECs, consisting of all institution-specific Principal Investigators (PIs) (Lead, Co-PIs, and Co-Leaders of all
cores and shared resources) meet once a month and are responsible for the day-to-day oversight at each
institution. The PLC, consisting of the leaders and co-leaders of all three institutions, as in the past, will have a
monthly tele-conference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the
Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a
year, the Partnershipâ€™s progress and decisions and provides guidance to the overall Partnership. The PSC,
consisting of seven external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs,
and an NCI-official as an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates
all components of the Partnershipâ€™s progress and provides guidance. Further, a Scientific Review Committee,
consisting of all PIs and a science editor, solicits pilot projects that will be funded in years 4 and 5 of the
funding cycle, and assigns to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and for funding after obtaining
approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other, and most
of these leaders have been successfully working together for more than 10 years. The Program Managers,
together with Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, aid the Partnership by providing
day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and logistical
services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions. Additionally, the Presidents and PIs of all three

5R01MH116736-02,Testing Strategies for Couple Engagement in PMTCT and Family Health in Kenya,"Despite the potential for antiretroviral therapy to improve maternal health and reduce mother-to-child
transmission of HIV to as low as 1%, HIV-related maternal deaths and HIV infection among infants remain
unacceptably high across sub-Saharan Africa. This is particularly true in Kenya, where crucial drop-offs occur
in the cascade of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services. Weak health systems
contribute to insufficient service coverage, but many barriers lie beyond the clinicâ€”in the partner, family, and
community factors that shape women's health decisions. Our team's research in a high HIV prevalence area of
southwestern Kenya has shown that many women avoid couples HIV testing and do not adhere to PMTCT
regimens because they fear negative consequences from a male partner. Men can play a crucial supportive
role for family health, but male partners in Kenya are poorly engaged in antenatal care and uptake of couples
HIV testing during pregnancy is low. Pregnant women desire to be tested for HIV together with their partner
and need the support for mutual disclosure involved in couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC), regardless
of whether they know their own HIV status. In this context, we propose to test the efficacy of an
interdependence theory-based couples intervention that reaches pregnant women and male partners through
home visits by male-female pairs of lay health workers, and includes offer of home-based CHTC services. Our
randomized pilot study of this intervention with 96 pregnant couples (R34MH102103) demonstrated significant
increases in uptake of couples testing (64% in intervention vs. 23% in control, p<0.001) and significant
improvements in health behaviors such as exclusive breastfeeding and postpartum care. We now propose a
more robust investigation to determine whether this intervention improves uptake of couples HIV testing and
health outcomes over and above less intensive male engagement strategies being used in the region. We
propose to conduct a three-arm trial among 1080 pregnant women and partners, randomizing them to home-
based couple visits, HIV self-test (HIVST) kits to use with their male partner, or standard care (male partner
clinic invitation letters), following couples up to 18 months postpartum. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects
of the intervention on our primary outcome of couple HIV testing, compared to HIVST kits and standard care.
In Aim 2, we examine intervention impact on HIV prevention behaviors, facility delivery, and postnatal
healthcare utilization. Among couples living with HIV, secondary outcomes include maternal VL suppression
and HIV-free child survival up to 18 months. In Aim 3, we compare the cost-effectiveness of the home-based
couples intervention to the less resource-intensive strategies used in the other two study arms. Our theory-
based couples intervention has strong potential to increase couple HIV testing and collaboration for family
health. This study will inform decision-makers about cost-effective strategies to engage pregnant couples in
PMTCT and family health, with important downstream benefits for maternal, paternal, and infant health.","Project Narrative
This research will contribute to public health efforts to improve the health of pregnant women, their male
partners, and infants in low-resource settings by examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a home-
based intervention to increase couple HIV testing and counseling and mutual disclosure. Such efforts to
engage both members of the couple in support of family health will have important implications for uptake of
HIV prevention and treatment, as well as for maternal, paternal, and child health. This research has the

5R01MH104114-05,Mechanisms and longitudinal effects of stigma on women's adherence and outcomes,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence to HIV treatment recommendations including adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV care visits is essential for persons living with HIV to achieve health, longevity, and an undetectable viral load.
Some studies have found that women have worse adherence to ART and higher morbidity and mortality than men. Compared to White women, women of color are at higher risk of acquiring HIV, and have worse health outcomes once infected. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify barriers to adherence and associated clinical outcomes among women living with HIV, particularly among minority women, and to develop responsive interventions. One potentially important barrier is HIV-related stigma. Cross-sectional and qualitative studies suggest that stigma and discrimination not only threaten quality of life for persons living with HIV, but are alo associated with worse ART and visit adherence, with negative effects on health outcomes. However, the field has limited understanding of 1) the causal/temporal relationships between stigma, adherence, and health outcomes, 2) the dimensions of HIV-related stigma that influence these outcomes, 3) the causal mechanisms through which stigma may adversely affect health potentially both through biological mechanisms (e.g., chronic stress processes) and through treatment adherence, and 4) the intersection of HIV-related stigma with other forms of stigma and discrimination due to race/ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status (SES). To address these gaps in knowledge, we will leverage the resources of the national Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), which has been collecting data on HIV-infected women's treatment adherence, mental health, and immunologic and virologic outcomes for 20 years. HIV-infected women enrolled in WIHS face challenges to adherence, and the barriers appear to be even greater for women being newly recruited into WIHS in the southern United States. In addition to supporting continuation of measures of internalized stigma and disclosure in national WIHS data collection, we propose a yearly supplementary visit at 3 WIHS sites in different parts of the country the Deep South, the Southeast, and California. In these visits we will assess theoretically important dimensions of HIV-related stigma, hypothesized mediating mechanisms, intersectional stigma (due to HIV, race/ethnicity, gender, and SES), and chronic stress responses (hair cortisol levels). We will elucidate the longitudinal associations between internalized HIV-related stigma, adherence to HIV treatment, and corresponding immunologic and virologic outcomes in the national WIHS cohort. We will use data collected at 3 WIHS sites to examine a) the associations of other dimensions of HIV-related stigma with treatment adherence and health outcomes, b) potential mechanisms through which dimensions of HIV-related stigma may adversely affect adherence and health outcomes, and c) the link between intersectional stigma and adherence using mixed methods research. Findings will have important theoretical implications, as well as provide crucial information for policies and programs striving to improve outcomes for women living with HIV.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will contribute to public health efforts to improve the health of women living with HIV, by conducting an in-depth examination of the effects of HIV-related stigma and discrimination. A growing body of research suggests that fears and experiences of stigma and discrimination not only affect the quality of life for persons living wit HIV, but also serve as barrier to adherence to HIV treatment recommendations, with resulting negative effects on HIV-related health outcomes. We propose to examine these issues among women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a longitudinal cohort of HIV-positive women in the United States, and to use this information to tailor policies and interventions in order to have the maximum benefits for women's adherence and health.",2019,593199,514818,78381,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Pediatric; Pediatric AIDS; Prevention,Janet M.

2P30AI027767-31,Core J Behavioral and Community Sciences Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Behavioral and Community Sciences Core (Core J)
Behavioral, psychosocial, and structural (economic, policy, organizational, or other aspects of the environment)
factors are of utmost importance in the current era of effective HIV prevention and treatment tools. These tools
require uptake, adherence, and sustained engagement in care to be impactful, and there are vulnerable sub-
groups in the United States who are still unable to access the full continuum of HIV prevention and care
services. The Behavioral and Community Sciences Core of the UAB CFAR, Core J, advances science by: 1)
enhancing methodological skills of investigators for the conduct of high-quality behavioral and community
sciences research; 2) building capacity for creative collaborations between university researchers and
communities; and 3) supporting research on priority topics essential to ending disparities in HIV-related health.
These efforts have resulted in an impressive growth of HIV behavioral and community science research at
UAB over the past award period, including successful K and R level grants, peer-reviewed publications, and
strengthened capacity of HIV researchers and local community-based organizations. Through Core J
methodological offerings, we enable HIV researchers to use state-of-the-art methodologies and theories from
the fields of behavioral and social sciences to better understand sources of vulnerability and resilience. In
addition to continuing Core J training opportunities in qualitative research, mixed methods research, and
advanced quantitative analytical techniques, in the next award period we will add new trainings in
implementation science, community-based intervention trials, and use of contemporary mobile tools. Core J
also promotes use of the methods of Community Engaged Research to ensure that research and interventions
meet the needs of affected populations. It is necessary to create linkages and collaborations between
researchers and communities and to expand the skills and capacity of both HIV researchers and community-
based organizations (CBOs). Core J accomplishes this through forming collaborative networks, organizing
community-focused seminars and capacity-building activities for CBOs, and providing logistical support to an
innovative grassroots CFAR Engaged Community workgroup. Core J community engagement experts assist
HIV researchers with connecting to appropriate community partners, developing and carrying out culturally
appropriate recruitment strategies to access hard-to-reach populations, and maintaining meaningful
partnerships with community members during implementation of HIV research studies and demonstration
projects. Core J's community engagement efforts will be systematically integrated into every component of the
90-90-90 targets, assuring community voices are heard. All of this supports priority target areas for ending HIV
including reducing stigma, engaging faith and spiritual communities, addressing behavioral aspects of new HIV
prevention and treatment technologies, enhancing adolescent sexual and reproductive health behaviors and
outcomes, and elucidating strategies to promote linkage and sustained engagement in HIV care.",,2019,234305,157781,76524,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Substance Abuse,Janet M.

1R03AI146151-01,Defining the attachment of collagen-like protein BclA to B. anthracis spores,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Bacteria interact with their environments primarily through proteins attached to their surfaces. These
proteins enable different lifestylesâ€”and in the case of pathogens, direct the course of infection. The diverse
mechanisms responsible for attaching surface proteins have been investigated extensively and are frequently
used as targets in therapeutic intervention. A number of pathogenic bacteria produce infectious spores that
display a variety of important surface proteins; however, little is known about how these proteins are attached.
A prime example is the collagen-like protein BclA, which is attached to the surface of spores of Bacillus
anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax.
 The outmost exosporium layer of B. anthracis spores is composed of an external hair-like nap and an
underlying basal layer. The filaments of the nap are formed by trimers of BclA, which are tightly attached to
basal layer protein BxpB. BclA attachment occurs through its 38-residue amino terminal domain (NTD), which
is proteolytically processed during sporulation to remove residues 1-19. This event apparently triggers BclA
attachment (through residues 20-38) to BxpB to form complexes that are resistant to conditions that routinely
disrupt noncovalent interactions. The protease responsible for BclA processing has not been identified, but it
does not appear to be BxpB or an enzymatically active domain of BclA. Recombinant versions of BclA and
BxpB can form extremely tight complexes in vitro, suggesting that other factors are not required for attachment.
 The goal of this study is to define the stable interaction between BclA and BxpB. This bond is likely to
be covalent. To identify this bond, BclA-BxpB complexes will be proteolytically digested, and the resulting
peptides will be separated and sequenced by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results
will identify covalently linked residues and the chemical nature of the covalent bond. Additionally, BclA and
BxpB binding sites will be mapped by using hydrogen deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry. The nature
of these sites can suggest a mechanism for covalent bond formation and, in the event that a covalent bond is
not involved, will identify noncovalent interactions capable of forming an unusually tight protein complex.
 The expected outcome of this study is the elucidation of an important and new type of protein
attachment to a bacterial cell, a spore in this case. This mechanism is likely shared by many spore-forming
bacteria that attach collagen-like proteins to their spores, including pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. It is
also possible that non-spore-forming organisms use a mechanism analogous to that of BclA-BxpB attachment
to form stable protein complexes. Furthermore, BclA and BclA homologs play important roles in pathogenesis
and persistent attachment to environmental surfaces. Thus, understanding the mechanism of BclA attachment
affords new targets for treatment and prevention of anthrax and other diseases.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This proposal is relevant to public health because it elucidates a fundamental and general property of protein
attachment to bacterial spores that plays a critical role in pathogenesis. These studies are relevant to NIHâ€™s
mission to acquire knowledge that is important in the development of new strategies to treat and prevent
infections disease. These studies are also important for NIH's national defense mission because they define a
critical feature of Bacillus anthracis spores, the causative agent of anthrax and a serious threat as an agent of
bioterrorism.",2019,74250,50000,24250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Anthrax; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases,CHARLES LEE TURNBOUGH
1R21NS109644-01A1,CD11d antagonism for chronic inflammatory neuropathies,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Our objective is to evaluate whether inhibition of CD11d-dependent leukocyte infiltration into peripheral nerves
is a specific therapy for peripheral nerve inflammation seen in chronic immune-mediated disorders and
neuropathic pain. Using chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) as an example of
persistent peripheral nerve inflammation that results in significant chronic neuropathic pain and long-term
disability, we propose to address a fundamental question: Is competitive antagonism of CD11d a potential
treatment strategy for chronic peripheral neuritis?
Based on our exciting new preliminary data using human in vitro and in situ approaches, we propose the
following hypothesis: CD11d expressed by pathogenic CIDP patient monocytes and lymphocytes
actively participate in their selective trafficking across the blood-nerve barrier in peripheral nerves. As
an extension of this, we propose that competitive inhibition with a function neutralizing monoclonal
antibody would reduce leukocyte trafficking at the blood-nerve barrier. Modulating leukocyte infiltration
would limit harmful consequences of chronic peripheral nerve inflammation, demyelination and axonal injury.
This strategy provides an opportunity to develop a novel targeted therapy for CIDP and neuropathic pain.
In order to address this hypothesis, we will determine that CD11d antagonism reduces trafficking of untreated
CIDP patient peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in an established human in vitro blood-nerve barrier
model that incorporates hydrodynamic flow. Trafficking events would be captured real-time and quantified by
video microscopy. We will also evaluate the effect of CD11d antagonism on the neurobehavioral,
electrophysiological and histopathological features of progressive chronic peripheral nerve inflammation,
demyelination and axonal injury in a severe, reliable CIDP mouse model, using our published methods.
Current therapies for CIDP and other peripheral nerve inflammatory disorders, including chronic neuropathic
pain are non-specific and partly effective. This proposal is a preclinical evaluation of CD11d antagonism as a
targeted molecular anti-inflammatory therapy for CIDP. Inhibiting disease-specific inflammatory pathways has
the potential to revolutionize the treatment of chronic peripheral nerve inflammation. The proposed work could
lead towards an NINDS CREATE Bio grant to develop novel therapeutic drugs for phase I clinical trials in CIDP
and other chronic inflammatory neuropathies, as well as the consequential chronic neuropathic pain.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The purpose of our work is to discover a new treatment for an under-recognized, but severe disabling
nerve inflammation disease called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).
CIDP equally affects both sexes, all ages, racial/ ethnic groups and socioeconomic status. By finding
new treatments for CIDP, we can hopefully better treat or cure this problem, improve the lives of patients

5F31NS106733-02,Regulation of alpha synuclein release and toxicity by Rab27b,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This application is for F31 support for Rachel Underwood for the remainder of her PhD training.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremendous
economic and social burden worldwide. Alpha-synuclein (Î±syn) is the key protein component of intracellular
aggregates termed Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease2. In its non-native form,
Î±syn is thought to propagate throughout the brain in a prion-like fashion: when released, it can be taken up by
surrounding neurons to cause aggregation and cell death by inducing the misfolding of endogenous Î±syn3-6.
However, the mechanism that regulates the release and spread of Î±syn is poorly understood. Î±Syn release
has previously been shown to involve exosomal and non-exosomal pathways involving endosomes which are
tightly regulated by a family of GTPase proteins termed Rabs8-12. Rab27b is a GTPase protein that regulates
protein secretion through both exosomal and non-exosomal pathways and is highly expressed in the human
brain13-15. In addition, Rab27b polymorphisms have been associated with a higher motor neuron disease risk in
GWAS studies16. Rab27b transcriptional dysregulation has also been associated with other neurological
disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism
syndrome17-19. Our data shows that Rab27b expression is increased in human PD postmortem brain tissue in
comparison to age-matched healthy controls (Fig. 4). Our preliminary data also indicates that Rab27b
modulates the release of Î±syn in vitro (Fig. 5). Our central hypothesis is that Rab27b promotes Î±syn-
mediated neurotoxicity by inducing the release and spread of toxic Î±syn species.
 The goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of Rab27b on Î±syn release, spread, and paracrine
toxicity. In Aim 1, we will test if Rab27b regulates Î±syn release and toxicity in a paracrine tetracycline-inducible
Î±syn cell model, in which Î±syn, upon induction with doxycycline, is released into the conditioned media (CM)
and induces cell death when transferred to separately cultured neurons. We will use knockdown and dominant
negative technology to test if Rab27b regulates Î±syn release, clearance, and toxicity in this model. In Aim 2,
we will test if Rab27b regulates Î±syn aggregation, spread, and neurotoxicity in cellular and in vivo Î±syn fibril
based PD models. If our hypothesis is true, Rab27b may prove to be a useful research tool and a potential
target for therapeutic intervention to reduce Î±syn propagation in PD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Parkinson's Disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder but there is currently no cure
or treatment to halt disease progression. In this proposal, we will investigate the potential role for Rab27b in
modulating the spread of toxic alpha synuclein, the key protein implicated in Parkinson's disease. Our studies
will point to a potential mechanism to target for slowing disease progression and alleviate clinical symptoms.",2019,36031,36031,,"Training, Individual",F31,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Rachel N Underwood
7R21AI135709-02,Viral transcription in herpesvirus-induced necroptosis,"Project Summary/Abstract
Programmed cell death is a critical component of the host antiviral response to infection, serving to limit viral
replication, dissemination and spread. Recent attention has revealed programmed necrosis, or necroptosis, as
a highly efficient, and important arm of this host response. Necroptosis is controlled by the receptor interacting
protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which receives activating signals arising from ligation of death receptors or pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) to drive rapid cell destruction and limit virus replication. As obligate intracellular
pathogens that establish life-long infections, herpesviruses control the fate of the cells they infect, encoding a
variety of mechanisms to inhibit the host cell death machinery and promote successful infection. The viral
inhibitor of RIP activation (vIRA), encoded by the M45 gene product of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV),
directly inhibits the activation of RIPK3. In the absence of vIRA function, a PRR known as DNA-dependent
activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI/ZBP1) responds to infection and activates RIPK3 to drive
necroptosis. While initially described as a cytosolic DNA sensor, accumulating evidence suggests a number of
other diverse viruses, including other herpesviruses, influenza and poxviruses, also activate DAI. However, the
mechanisms by which they do so remain unclear. Our preliminary studies have revealed that MCMV-induced
necroptosis requires viral gene expression mediated by the major immediate early (IE) transactivator, IE3.
These data lead to our overall hypothesis that MCMV IE3-dependent transcripts serve as a ligand recognized
by DAI to drive antiviral necroptosis, which is inhibited by vIRA during natural infection. This hypothesis will be
tested in two specific aims. First, we propose to combine genetic, biochemical and genomics approaches with
a set of unique recombinant viruses to define the role of IE3 in necroptosis and identify the ligand(s) it
generates to elicit this pathway. Second, we will interrogate and dissect the mechanism by which DAI
recognizes MCMV infection and activates RIPK3. The studies proposed here are intended to fill a critical gap
in our knowledge of how viruses like MCMV trigger host antiviral necroptosis, and are anticipated to provide
insight into how other viruses with significant human health consequences interact with this pathway.","Project Narrative
Necroptosis is an emerging cell death pathway increasingly associated with infectious agents,
inflammatory disease and human health. The goal of the current proposal is to understand the
molecular mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus gene expression promotes antiviral
necroptosis, and how these viruses subvert this pathway to facilitate successful infection.
Defining these mechanisms will uncover new strategies for therapeutic intervention against
infection and inflammation.",2019,187475,125000,62475,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,AL,Auburn,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,368325888,Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections,Jason W Upton
7R01CA235162-02,Evaluating ADGRB3 as a tumor suppressor epigenetically silenced in WNT medulloblastoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY: No changes from initial submission
There is an urgent need to develop novel therapies for patients with medulloblastoma (MB), the most common
malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumor in children. Current treatments include surgery, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy and result in 5-year survival rates of 40-90% depending on subtype. However, children
suffer important morbidity secondary to treatment, including neurological, intellectual and physical disabilities.
The overall purpose of the present project is to investigate the role of the ADGRB3 receptor in susceptibility
of cerebellar transformation, and explore new therapies for MB based on the related mechanisms. ADGRB3
is an orphan seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) specifically expressed in the brain,
and belonging to the adhesion-type sub-family. Our new preliminary data show that ADGRB3 expression is
significantly reduced in patients with MBs of the WNT group, and the promoter is epigenetically silenced,
suggesting that ADGRB3 loss may facilitate WNT-MB formation. We present evidence for the involvement
of methylated CpG binding protein MBD2 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 in switch to a silent
chromatin. Moreover, we show that reactivation of ADGRB3 can reduce cell proliferation and tumor growth,
supporting a tumor suppressive role. To test this in the physiological setting, we generated ADGRB3 knockout
(KO) mice, which we plan to cross with mice expressing mutant b-catenin in neural progenitors of the
rhombic lip and dorsal brainstem, which are the cells of origin of WNT-MB. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that ADGRB3 is a tumor suppressor in the cerebellum and that restoration of its expression with
epigenetic therapy may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for children with WNT-MB. To test our
hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (i) identify and target the epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying
ADGRB3 gene silencing in WNT-MB, (ii) determine whether and how restoration of ADGRB3 expression
can inhibit MB cell growth, oncogenic signaling and tumorigenic properties, and (iii) determine whether loss
of ADGRB3 gene expression in the background of oncogenic Ctnnb1 activation predisposes mice to cerebellar
transformation and MB tumor development. These studies are important as they increase our knowledge
about developmental neurobiology in the CNS, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic
approaches for patients with medulloblastoma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE: No changes from the initial submission
We want to study the role of adhesion GPCR ADGRB3 as a tumor suppressor in the formation
of medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor in children. We found that ADGRB3 gene is silenced in the
WNT subgroup of medulloblastoma and that reactivation of its expression by epigenetic means has
therapeutic benefits. The knowledge derived from these studies may lead to the development of novel pigenetic
therapies for brain cancer through the restoration of the ADGRB3 tumor suppressor pathway function.",2019,425072,286244,138828,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,,ERWIN G. VAN MEIR
5R01MH106366-04,An RCT of Speed of Processing Training in Middle-Aged and Older Adults with HIV,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As people age with HIV, the synergistic effects with normal age-related cognitive declines will accentuate and/or accelerate declines in cognitive functioning which can be detected as early as in one's 40s. Although interventions are needed to protect/improve cognitive functioning, one intervention already exists to improve speed of processing. NINR/NIA (January 14, 2014) announced that Speed of Processing Training used in the ACTIVE Study (N = 2,802 community-dwelling older adults) has the ability to enable ""older people to maintain their cognitive abilities as they age"" even 10 years after training. As shown in
the ACTIVE Study, this intervention uniquely improves driving, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), health-related quality of life, self-rated health, internal locus of control, and protects one from depression; these represent areas of needed intervention for adults with HIV as well. In adults with HIV, our pilot studies likewise indicate speed of processing declines are associated with poorer driving simulator performance and more self-reported at-fault automobile crashes; such speed of processing declines on driving alone represent a significant public health concern. We also demonstrated that Speed of Processing Training improved this cognitive ability and translated into improved performance on a timed measure of IADLs. Based on our prior research, this RCT proposal consists of a pre-post two-year longitudinal experimental design whereby 264 adults with HIV, 40+ years and diagnosed with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder, will be randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: 1) 10 hours of laboratory-based Speed of Processing Training, 2) 20 hours of laboratory- based Speed of Processing Training, or 3) 10 hours of a standardized computer-contact control (sham) condition. AIM 1: Determine whether 10 vs 20 hours of speed of processing training will improve this cognitive ability at post-test, year 1, and year 2 after baseline. AIM 2: Determine whether 10 vs 20 hours of speed of processing training will improve everyday functioning at post-test, year 1, and year 2 after baseline. Exploratory AIM: Determine whether improvement in speed of processing and/or everyday functioning over time mediate improvement in quality of life (e.g., depression).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive aging with HIV is concerning due to three facts: 1) using Fascati criteria, ~50% of adults with HIV experience HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND), 2) by 2020, 70% of those with HIV will be 50 and older, and 3) age-related cognitive declines may exacerbate HAND. Such cognitive impairments occur in a number of domains (i.e., memory, attention) that negatively impact everyday functioning and quality of life. Fortunately, as observed in the 10-year ACTIVE Study (N = 2,802) which examined memory, reasoning, and speed of processing training, speed of processing training has superior properties to improve this cognitive ability and translate to improvements in everyday functioning and quality of life which has been shown in our pilot studies to improve outcomes for middle-aged (40+) and older adults with HIV; this study will build upon this existing science to improve cognitive and everyday functioning in adults with HIV.",2019,421611,286810,134801,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Mental Health,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF NURSING,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Neurodegenerative; Prevention; Rehabilitation,DAVID E VANCE
1R21DE028349-01,Hydrogel encapsulated biofilm inhibitors for dental caries prevention and treatment,"As the primary etiological agent for the dental caries development, Streptococcus mutans has developed
multiple mechanisms to colonize the tooth surface and become an integral part of the dental biofilm. Under
unhealthy conditions, pathogenic bacteria, namely acidogenic and aciduric species, begin to dominate the oral
population while the number of beneficial organisms such as Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus
gordonii decrease significantly. Biofilm then ferments the dietary carbohydrates producing acid byproducts
such as lactic acid which causes a decrease on oral pH leading to the demineralization of tooth. Normally, the
salivary system employs buffer systems to maintain a healthy pH of 6.0â€“7.5 in the oral cavity. A drop in the pH
below 5.5 is potentially harmful to the hard (enamel and dentin) and soft tissues in oral cavity. Therefore, we
hypothesize that a biofilm inhibitor that does not affect the viability of oral commensal bacteria delivered in to
oral cavity in a pH responsive (released when the pH drops below 5.5) manner will be an ideal approach to
prevent/treat dental caries. Preliminary studies from our labs have identified such specific low micromolar
small-molecule biofilm inhibitors that do not affect the growth of oral commensals. We have established that
these compounds produce their biofilm inhibition by inhibiting S. mutans virulence factor, glucosyl transferases.
Two active compounds identified from these studies, SN204 and SN199 consistently showed dose dependent
inhibition of biofilms with IC50 values of 16.7 ÂµM and 15 ÂµM, respectively. Furthermore these compounds did
not inhibit the viability of S. mutans and of the other two commensal species (S. sanguinis and S. gordonii) up
to 200 ÂµM, which is a much higher concentration than their biofilm IC50 values. A 43 day treatment of S.
mutans (UA159) infected dental caries in gnotobiotic rats with SN204 or SN199 have resulted in considerable
reduction in buccal, sulcal and proximal caries scores compared to the control groups. Given that the salivary
pH less than 5.5 is potentially harmful to the enamel, we aim to encapsulate our lead biofilm inhibitors within
the network of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) hydrogel nanoparticles which possess pH sensitivity and explore
the effect of such hydrogel encapsulated biofilm inhibitors (HEBIs) on biofilm formation and caries
development. In the preliminary studies, SN199 has been successfully encapsulated into hydrogel with a
loading capacity of 1.72Ã—10-5 ng per particle. As proof of principle, we have demonstrated the pH dependent
drug release of the small-molecule anticancer drug, doxorubicin from PMAA hydrogel in the previously
reported studies. The overall goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the biofilm inhibitory activity of HEBIs in
vitro & in vivo and establish its potential as a novel and selective biomaterial that can be used for the
prevention and treatment of dental caries. The long term goal of this project is to develop these HEBIs as
dental strips/creams that can be used any time, especially at night when sleeping in order to provide a steady,
on-demand release of biofilm inhibitors in the oral cavity to prevent/treat dental caries.","Current preventive measures for dental caries are ineffective largely because of the biofilm nature of caries
which makes cariogenic bacteria more resistant to traditional antimicrobial treatments. In addition, such
treatments are non-selective and affect the whole bacterial flora in oral cavity. This proposal seeks the
development of novel pH sensitive hydrogel encapsulated biofilm inhibitors (HEBI) for the prevention and
treatment of dental caries.",2019,179223,125000,54223,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,352940001,Bioengineering; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Nanotechnology; Prevention,Sadanandan E.

5R01NS094743-04,Understanding hippocampal internal architecture in human temporal lobe epilepsy -- from MRI to epigenetics,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project centers around the hippocampus, a part of the brain where seizures frequently occur in the most
common form of epilepsy in adults, temporal lobe epilepsy. Through a career development grant I have had
over the last five years through the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering I have
developed a technique called HR-MICRA that produces exceptionally high-resolution MRI images. This is
meaningful for the study of epilepsy because the hippocampus is not only the most epileptogenic structure in
the brain but it also has an extremely complicated internal architecture that is difficult to visualize with
conventional MRI techniques. Our preliminary data shows that the HR-MICRA technique is far superior to
conventional MRI techniques in regard to visualizing the internal structure of the hippocampus clearly and
consistently. Our preliminary data also shows that subtle abnormalities of the internal structure of the
hippocampus occur more frequently than previously thought even when the hippocampus overall looks
relatively normal. In this project we will compare the HR-MICRA technique on a regular 3T MRI scanner to an
equivalent technique using a powerful 7T research scanner at Auburn University, which there are only a few of
in the nation. If we show that 3T HR-MICRA is equivalent to 7T imaging, it will provide a tool to epilepsy
specialist and neuroscientists that can be relatively easily implement on most clinical scanners. In the second
part of this project we will use these high-resolution imaging techniques to study the internal structure of the
hippocamps in two groups of epilepsy patients -- those whose seizures are well-controlled and those whose
seizures are poorly controlled. We hypothesize that the high-resolution technique will show a subtle but definite
degree of blurring of the layers in the internal structure of the hippocampus that is more prominent in patients
with poorly controlled seizures. We then hypothesize that this blurring is due to activation of certain types of
cells in the brain called astrocytes. We will test this by scanning a series of patients with poorly controlled
seizures who then subsequently go on to have surgery to remove the hippocampus that is causing their
seizures. We will then examine their resected hippocampi under the microscope and assess whether there is
an increased degree of astrogliosis (more activated astrocytes) in certain layers, which would make certain
layers harder to see on the MRI scan. In the last phase of the project we will determine whether epigenetic
modification of the astrocytes' DNA is playing a role. Epigenetic modification refers to a natural process
whereby certain genes are turned on or off. If we do find that epigenetic mechanisms are at play in temporal
lobe epilepsy it may provide new therapeutic targets and advance our understanding of how the brain works in
disease and in health.","Project Narrative

5R01HL135060-03,IL10 Regulation of Fibroblast Progenitor Cell Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis,"Abstract
Activated cardiac fibroblasts (myofibroblast; myoFBs) are crucial players in excessive fibrosis, which
ultimately results in myocardial stiffness and heart failure development. Thus, regulation of fibroblasts
activation and associated fibrosis would be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of cardiac
diseases. Previous studies suggest that in addition to resident fibroblasts, bone marrow fibroblast
progenitor cells (FPCs) may home to the failing heart and contribute to excessive fibrosis. The overall goal
of this application is to determine the role of BM-derived FPCs and their paracrine signaling (via
exosomes) on pressure overload (PO)-induced cardiac fibrosis, and to determine whether inhibition of
function of this cell population results in the reduction of cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. We have
reported that PO-induced cardiac fibrosis is attenuated by systemic IL10 treatment and IL10-knockout
mice (IL10 KO) display exaggerated cardiac fibrosis. But the precise mechanism of anti-fibrotic role of IL10
is not well defined. Thus we hypothesized that â€œIL10 inhibits fibroblast progenitor cell (FPCs) homing and
trans-differentiation into myoFB and modifies FPC pro-fibrotic paracrine signaling thereby reducing cardiac
fibrosis and improving cardiac functionâ€. We will use WT (some with GFP reporter system), IL10 KO,
TGFbr1/2 KO and CCR2KO (RFP reporter system) mice in this study. In SA1, via bone marrow
transplantation strategy, we will determine whether FPC contributes in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis in
WT and IL10 Knock out mice and whether IL10 treatment inhibits it. In specific aim 2 we will identify the
TGFb downstream signaling targets [both canonical (Smad2/3), non-canonical (ERK-MAP kinase) and
miR associated with fibrosis] and their roles in FPC's trans-differentiation. To identify their role, we will
infect/transfect dominant negative adenovirus or kinase-dead construct (Smad/ERK) or antagomir (miRs)
with their respective control in WT and IL10KO FPCs. In specific aim 3 we propose to study the paracrine
regulation of FPCs on resident cardiac fibroblast activation and exaggerated fibrosis in IL10KO mice. In
this aim we will explore whether pro-fibrotic factors secreted by FPC (WT/IL10KO) via exosomes, induce
cardiac fibroblast transition to myoFB. To translate this finding in preclinical settings, in specific aim 3 we
will investigate whether transplantation of exosomes-derived from ex vivo-modified FPC (for target
miRs/proteins) in IL10 KO mice heart inhibits Ang II-induced fibrosis. The significance of this study is to
identify the novel mechanism(s) of IL10 in regulation of cardiac fibrosis. Our proposed experiments can
potentially identify novel therapeutic strategies for cardiac repair based on manipulation of bone marrow
fibroblast progenitor cells signaling after pressure overload-induced cardiac injury.","Relevance in Public Health (Narrative):
Heart failure is still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States. Cardiac fibrosis is a hallmark
for hypertrophic heart failure and its regulation could significantly improve mortality associated with this number
one killer disease in USA. Previously, others and we have shown that IL10 acts as a critical regulator of
cardiac fibrosis. In this proposal, we will investigate whether IL10 and its downstream signaling targets can
modulate fibroblast progenitor cell-mediated fibrosis and facilitate cardiac repair, thereby identifying a novel
regulator and target of cardiac repair to treat heart failure. The results of this proposal will therefore be highly
relevant for improving public health and improving the length and quality of life of millions of patients with
hypertrophic heart disease and heart failure.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human,Suresh K Verma
1R44NS115196-01,A Single Dose Long-Acting Non-Addictive Polymer Conjugate Formulation of Buprenorphine that Provides Immediate and Prolonged Analgesia for Post-Operative Pain,"PA-18-574
Project Summary/Abstract
SER-227 is a long-acting polymer pro-drug of buprenorphine that is being developed to treat post-
operative pain following major surgeries such as bunionectomy, abdominoplasty, thoracotomy and
knee and hip surgery. SER-227 has no biological activity by itself, but when administered in vivo
by subcutaneous injection it enters the vascular compartment where a plasma esterase
(butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) enzymatically releases the active pharmaceutical ingredient,
buprenorphine. The polymer confers prolonged circulatory half-life, allowing buprenorphine to be
released continuously over ~ 3-4 days. Buprenorphine is a mixed mu-agonist/antagonist at the mu
opioid receptor (MOR), and an antagonist at the kappa opioid receptor. A single administration
of SER-227 has been shown to provide both immediate and prolonged analgesia in the Brennan
model. Prompt analgesia, which subsequently lasts ~ 3-4 days, should obviate the need to initiate
therapy by a potentially addictive opioid in the hospital and allow patients to be discharged on
non-additive drugs such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs.
SER-227 is to be administered as a subcutaneous injection in the immediate post-operative period
(e.g. recovery room). This product is intended to be a one-time injection (by a
surgeon/anesthesiologist) that will provide both immediate and > 3 days of analgesia. SER-227 is
predicted to demonstrate very low abuse liability (indeed, long-acting implants of buprenorphine
are used to treat opioid use disorder) and is likely to be used largely in surgical centers; it is not
intended for self-administration.
A Research Strategy is presented that will focus on the early development and preclinical
objectives of this program, where the ultimate goal is to demonstrate that SER-227 can be
manufactured and tested preclinically to show that it is safe for use in a Phase I clinical study.
1. SER-227 chemistry and process optimization to generate a technical package, and
2. SER-227 manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices, and
3. Evaluated in formal toxicology studies in rodent and non-rodent animals so that justifications
 can be made to support a â€˜first-in-manâ€™ study,
4. Submission of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) along with a Phase I clinical
 protocol in normal volunteers to measure the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
 buprenorphine that is released from SER-227.
This â€˜Direct to Phase IIâ€™ submission is made under the â€˜HEAL Initiative, Notice of Interest in
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)

of the program would take 18 to 24 months to complete.","PA-18-574
Project Narrative
The current standard of treatment for post-operative pain, in particular in-hospital procedures (those that
require a hospital stay), is the administration of opioid drugs. This is frequently accomplished by an
intravenous administration of morphine (or similar opioid) that can be controlled by the patient (patient-
controlled analgesia, or PCA pump). In general, patients are transitioned to an oral opioid on day 2-3 at
which time they undergo progressive ambulation in preparation for discharge. Patients are frequently
discharged with a prescription for a potentially addictive opioid. In the event patients fill a prescription for
an opioid following discharge, independent of whether they have had minor or major surgery, they are 15
times more likely to transition to chronic use of an opioid within the next 90-180 days.1
For patients, families and the medical community, the emergence of dependence and addiction following
the use of opioids has become a serious concern and has driven the development of new approaches to pain
management. The prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is a pressing social, ethical and
medical challenge. In 2017 it was estimated that approximately 115 people died every day from an opioid
overdose â€“ making it the single highest cause of accidental death in the US.2 The amount of prescription
opioids sold to pharmacies, hospitals and physicianâ€™s offices quadrupled from 1999-2010 â€“ yet there was
not a coincident increase in the amount of pain reported in the US population. In one of the largest cohort
studies reported approximately 1 in 15 individuals prescribed an opioid for control of post-operative pain
transitioned to chronic use within one year.3 The current crisis posed by OUD has been decades in the
making and combatting it will take time and a coherent plan involving a number of different strategies
aimed at prevention, intervention and treatment. The reduction or elimination of the need to administer
addictive opioid drugs in the immediate post-operative period would target the initial gateway where
patients are first exposed to addictive drugs.4
SER-227 is a long acting formulation of buprenorphine that is being developed to treat patients with post-
operative pain that may be administered as a subcutaneous injection in the immediate post-operative period.
This product is intended to be a one-time injection (by a surgeon/anesthesiologist) that will provide > 3
days of analgesia, after which patients would transition to non-addictive medications (such as ibuprofen or
acetaminophen). SER-227 will have limited abuse liability and is not intended for self-
administration. While some consider buprenorphine a relatively weak mu-agonist, a very recent (2018)
meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing buprenorphine in its existing
formulation (Buprenex) to IV morphine via a PCA pump 5, showed that buprenorphine â€“ (1) was equal to
morphine in analgesic efficacy, (2) buprenorphine had a ceiling effect on respiratory depression but not
analgesia whereas morphine risk increases with dose, (3) there was no difference for major side effects
such as nausea and sedation, (4) no difference in need for rescue analgesia or time to rescue analgesia,
and (5) buprenorphine was superior to morphine in some adverse events â€“ primarily pruritis (a troublesome
side effect in the post-operative management of patients).
SER-227 may be a very important advance in the treatment of post-operative pain, while simultaneously
addressing the initial gateway in the hospital to a potentially addictive opioid.",2019,1658634,1632418,26216,SBIR/STTR,R44,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,"SERINA THERAPEUTICS, INC.",AL,HUNTSVILLE,Domestic For-Profits,358062916,Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Pain Research; Patient Safety; Prescription Drug Abuse; Substance Abuse,RANDALL W MOREADITH; Tacey Xavier Viegas
1R01AI147727-01,Mechanisms of HBV Functional Cure During Tenofovir-based ART in HIV/HBV Coinfection,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, affecting 240 million worldwide including 5-20% of HIV-infected
individuals, results from an inadequate immune response to acute infection and persistence of covalently
closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the host hepatocyte. During nucleos(t)ide analog therapy for chronic HBV,
`functional cure', the central therapeutic goal defined by loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with or
without surface antibody development, occurs slowly (~1%/year). There are now a growing number of novel
therapies in development to increase HBV functional cure if not achieve virological cure (i.e., elimination of the
cccDNA reservoir), including agents to restore HBV-specific immunity. Yet, the immune factors critical to
achieving functional cure remain poorly understood because HBsAg loss is usually rare and few studies have
assessed intrahepatic immune responses. To guide the use of novel therapies in HIV-HBV coinfection, a better
understanding is needed of the impact of HIV and HBV-active antiretroviral therapy (ART) on immune control
of HBV. In Zambia, we established a prospective cohort of HIV-HBV coinfected (n=303) and HBV
monoinfected (n=63) adults taking tenofovir (TDF)-based therapies. Within this cohort, which has strong local
laboratory capacity and access to liver sampling, we documented a strikingly high rate (13.1%) of HBsAg loss
among HIV-HBV patients during the first 2 years on TDF-based ART. We now propose to exploit this unique
scientific opportunity to investigate HBV functional cure in HIV infection. Our central hypothesis â€“ that in ART-
treated HIV-HBV coinfection, robust immune reconstitution unleashes an enhanced HBV functional cure
response â€“ will be tested in 3 aims. In Aim 1, using liver fine needle aspirations, we will define the immune
milieu in which HIV-HBV patients experience HBsAg loss/reduction during TDF-based therapy. Phenotypic
responses and single cell RNA-sequencing signatures of T cells and other immune cell types will be compared
by HIV status and CD4 changes during therapy. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of ART-induced
immune reconstitution in HIV-HBV coinfection on the change in peripheral markers of cccDNA transcription
including quantitative HBsAg and two novel markers, hepatitis B core-related antigens and HBV RNA. In Aim
3, we will define the clinical predictors of HBV functional cure among HIV-HBV coinfected individuals. This
project, which combines translational, clinical, and epidemiological approaches, and leverages an existing NIH-
funded cohort, will lead to a better understanding of (a) the impact of HIV on HBV natural history, (b) how
immunological therapies might work in HIV-HBV coinfection, and (c) whether novel peripheral cccDNA markers
can be used in this population. The proposed research will also advance the broader HBV cure agenda,
including the strategy to combine immune modulation with targeted virological interventions to achieve HBV
functional cure.","NARRATIVE
Within a hepatitis B virus (HBV) cohort in Zambia that has documented high rates of hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) loss among HBV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected patients, we will evaluate
the immune factors critical to achieving functional cure using in-depth intrahepatic and peripheral assessment.
The impact of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-induced immune reconstitution on HBV control will be
assessed using peripheral biomarkers that reflect intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA, including
quantitative HBsAg, hepatitis B core-related antigens, and HBV RNA. We will also determine the host and viral

1R34MH121103-01,Feasibility of an integrated intervention to reduce advanced HIV disease mortality among hospitalized adults in Zambia,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV prevalence remains high in inpatient settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite robust scale-up of
antiretroviral therapy. While HIV-related mortality during hospitalization is high (10-25%), mortality in the 6
months after discharge is even higher (20-40% in several cohort studies), with many deaths resulting from
tuberculosis (TB) and Cryptococcal coinfection. Therefore, interventions to optimize the care of advanced HIV
disease (i.e., CD4 <200 or WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 conditions) during hospitalization could have a substantial
impact on overall HIV-related mortality. In a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults admitted to the hospital
in Zambia, failure to diagnose and treat coinfections during the hospital admission was due to (1) delays in
obtaining CD4 count results and additional screening tests for disseminated TB and Cryptococcus and (2)
provider misconceptions of the urgency of providing HIV care in inpatient settings. Building on these results
and our experience implementing HIV interventions and training clinicians in Zambia, we now propose a multi-
component intervention to reduce post-hospital mortality, based on the Predisposing, Reinforcing, and
Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) framework. The intervention
consists of (a) a package of point-of-care (POC) laboratory tests (such as CD4, urine TB LAM antigen,
Cryptococcal antigen, and HIV viral load) to enable clinicians to treat coinfections during admission, (b)
targeted knowledge transfer to clinicians regarding best practices for advanced HIV disease to predispose
them to treat coinfections, and (c) feedback reporting about post-discharge outcomes to inpatient staff to
reinforce the approach. In Aim 1, we will develop the POC laboratory package and related standard operating
procedures with input from key informants. In Aim 2, to inform the clinician training component, we will conduct
focus group discussions with clinicians to explore perspectives and beliefs of the urgency and potential impact
of providing interventions for advanced HIV disease during admission. In Aim 3, we will pilot-test the
intervention and evaluate feasibility and impact on clinician practice. We will compare treatment of coinfections
during the intervention with historical control data. This study will lead to a better understanding of how to
deliver advanced HIV disease interventions during hospitalization. It will also assess the potential of a theory-
based intervention to reduce post-discharge mortality among HIV-infected individuals in SSA.","NARRATIVE

these patients to explore their perspectives and beliefs on expanding the HIV care that is provided during

5U01EY025858-04,Changes in Visual Cortical Connectivity Following Central Visual Field Loss,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People who have macular degeneration often lose the ability to see in the part of vision normally used for daily tasks such as reading and recognizing faces. This often debilitating loss is expected to afflict 3 million US citizens by 202. An essential health-related goal is therefore to develop strategies that allow patients with macular degeneration to make better use of their spared peripheral vision. Despite loss of central vision, many patients learn to successfully navigate the world, becoming adept at using peripheral vision for tasks normally done with central vision. The mechanisms underlying this visual plasticity are not known, but are of great clinical interest, because better understanding can lead to improved treatment strategies following vision loss. Plasticity after macular degeneration is also of great basic science interest because it provides insight to nervous system plasticity in a human model, which is key for understanding and treating a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Most work examining plasticity after vision loss has studied bottom-up remapping of inputs, and this remapping appears to be minimal in adults. We propose to examine connections between the early visual cortex and frontal and parietal brain networks, which have the potential to be more plastic. We will make use of the Human Connectome Project dataset and protocols to identify how the structure and connections of early visual areas are altered following loss of central vision due to macular degeneration. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the neuroplastic mechanisms that allow patients with MD to use peripheral vision for tasks, such as reading and recognizing faces, for which people with healthy vision use the macula. Our central hypothesis is that greater reliance on peripheral vision following MD leads visual cortical regions representing the periphery to become structurally and functionally more similar to those representing the macula, thus improving functional vision. The motivation for the proposed research is that better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie enhanced peripheral vision in patients who suffer from macular degeneration is essential to developing the next generation of therapeutic interventions. We will test our central hypothesis by identifying how the following characteristics of early visual areas change after central vision loss: 1) functional connectivity to fronto-parietal control regions, (2 structural measures of white matter integrity, (3) cortical thickness. We will compare participants
with age-related macular degeneration to matched controls using the Human Connectome Project protocols. These aims are expected to yield information about how top-down connections to early visual areas contribute to plasticity after vision loss. This contribution wil be significant because it will fundamentally alter our understanding of how the brain compensates after vision loss, and revise our understanding of neural plasticity in general. This knowledge wil guide the development of new strategies for training patients with vision loss to use their spared vision more effectively.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: When people lose central vision, they must use peripheral vision to do daily tasks like reading and recognizing faces. This proposal will examine how changes in the connectivity and structure of early visual cortex relate to this huge shift in experience. This is relevant to public health because it develops fundamental knowledge about how the visual system adapts after vision loss and this knowledge may be used to advance future therapies.",2019,402915,463991,207042,Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,National Eye Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Kristina  Visscher
5R01NS102257-02,Role of presynaptic targeting of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are characterized by cytoplasmic inclusions
called Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites which are composed primarily of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). Multiple lines of
evidence suggest that these inclusions contribute to disease pathogenesis. Thus, preventing Î±-syn
aggregation is a critical therapeutic target for preventing disease progression. Normally, Î±-syn resides at the
presynaptic terminal, preferentially associates with synaptic vesicles, and interaction of Î±-syn with membranes
inhibit its aggregation. Our proposed study seeks to determine how presynaptic targeting of Î±-syn prevents it
from converting to a pathologic, aggregation prone form and how PD risk factors disrupt the normal localization
of Î±-syn and increase its propensity to forming inclusions. Mutations in leucine rich repeat kinase (LRRK2) are
the most common cause of familial Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We showed that the G2019S-LRRK2 mutations
increase the formation of Î±-syn inclusions and that LRRK2 kinase inhibitors reduce inclusion formation, but the
mechanisms by which LRRK2 controls the propensity of Î±-syn to form aggregates is unknown. Although
current research focuses on the role of LRRK2 in degradative organelles, LRRK2 has also been functionally
implicated at the presynaptic terminal and may play a role in Î±-syn presynaptic membrane targeting. Recently,
a subset of Rab GTPases was identified as LRRK2 substrates. Rabs control distinct steps in membrane
trafficking pathways in the cell. Ten years ago, the Lindquist lab identified the same Rabs (that were recently
shown to be phosphorylated by LRRK2) as protective in models of Î±-syn toxicity. We will determine if Rabs
phosphorylated by LRRK2 enhance presynaptic targeting of Î±-syn and prevent Î±-syn inclusion formation.
Because inclusions localize to multiple brain regions in PD and DLB, we will inject fibrils into the mouse
striatum which produces inclusions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), cortex, and amygdala. In
Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which select Rab isoforms influence Î±-syn presynaptic targeting using
novel AAV vectors to increase Rab expression in the brain or use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to reduce
Rab levels. Immunohistochemistry and biochemistry will be used to determine if expression of these Rabs in
vivo prevents formation of fibril-induced inclusions in multiple brain regions, and loss of dopamine neurons in
the SNpc. In Aim 2, we will identify the Rab effectors in neurons that specify targeting of vesicles containing Î±-
syn cargo to the presynaptic terminal. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine if LRRK2 kinase activity prevents
presynaptic targeting of Î±-syn and if the mislocalization of Î±-syn in the cell increases its propensity to form
inclusions. We will also determine the extent to which LRRK2 kinase inhibitors and ASOs in preclinical
development enhance presynaptic targeting of Î±-syn. These studies will open up new research avenues for
understanding how factors and genes that cause PD and DLB increase the propensity of Î±-syn to aggregate,
and how to therapeutically target LRRK2 and downstream effectors to prevent the progression of PD.","Aggregates of Î±-synuclein found in neurons throughout the brain characterize Parkinsonâ€™s disease and
Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Our goal is to stop the progression of these diseases by preventing the
conversion of Î±-synuclein from its normal form to a form more susceptible to forming aggregates. Also, by
understanding the mechanisms by which genes that cause PD cause this pathologic conversion we can
identify novel therapeutic targets.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Laura A.

1F31HL147512-01,Cytotoxic Lung Endothelial Amyloids,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity is vital for efficient gas exchange and to prevent the hematogenous
dissemination of respiratory pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a predominant agent of nosocomial
pneumonia, breaches the endothelial barrier by inducing junctional complex disruption leading to alveolar
flooding and hypoxemia. Here, we propose to study a previously unidentified, novel disease process defined by
the interaction of the common nosocomial pathogen, P. aeruginosa, with the host endothelium. P. aeruginosa
utilizes a Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to inject cytotoxic exoenzymes directly into the host cell. Exoenzyme
Y (ExoY), a T3SS effector expressed by ~90% of clinical P. aeruginosa strains, causes marked increases in
cytosolic cGMP, cUMP, and cAMP. The increase in cAMP facilitates the phosphorylation of an endothelial tau,
which dissociates from microtubules, followed by microtubule collapse, interendothelial gap formation, and
increased permeability. Hyperphosphorylated tau then coalesces into cytotoxic tau oligomers that are released
into the extracellular milieu. These cytotoxic tau oligomers are transmissibleand self-propagating amyloid prions.
The respective roles of cGMP and cUMP are currently unknown, although preliminary data establishes both a
temporal and spatial correlation between the increase in ExoY-generated cUMP and oligomeric tau release from
PMVECs. The cUMP signal in the bulk cytosol closely coincides with both the reduction of cytosolic tau and the
concomitant increase of extracellular tau. Thus, an ExoY-instigated increase in cUMP is implicated in the export
of cytotoxic tau. Furthermore, within the context of neurodegenerative disease, the degradation and recycling
pathway of autophagy is often pathologically constrained thereby preventing the breakdown of excess or
dysregulated amyloids. Following the inhibition of autophagic flux, dysregulated amyloids accumulate and
oligomerize. Clearance of nascent tau oligomers is often facilitated via exosomal and/or secretion mediated
export. Concordant with our observations, ExoY has recently been implicated in the suppression of the innate
immune response via the inhibition of transforming growth factor-Î²-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) which has also
been reported to obstruct autophagy. Taken together, ExoY suppression of TAK1 in PMVECs may contribute to
the inhibition of autophagy and the production of infection-induced tau prions. Therefore, this proposal tests the
hypothesis that ExoY-induced cUMP contributes to the suppression of autophagic flux thereby promoting the
generation and release of cytotoxic tau that transmissibly disrupts interendothelial junctions and promotes
perm eability.

membrane, causing neurons to depolarize. However, AMPARs that lack the GluR2 subunit are also permeable
to Ca2+. These Ca2-permeable (CP) AMPARs are highly expressed during development when they are
essential for activity-dependent plasticity, and this function persists at some synapses throughout adulthood. A
biophysical characteristic known as rectification is commonly used to differentiate CP-AMPARs from Ca2+-impermeable (CI) AMPARs. Whereas CP-AMPARs exhibit strong inward rectification, CI-AMPA receptors
display linear current-voltage relationships. Inward rectification of CP-AMPARs results from intracellular
polyamines that act as open channel blockers to prevent outward current flux. Thus, inward rectification and
sensitivity to antagonists that bind at the polyamine site provide biophysical signatures of AMPAR subunit
composition and hence Ca2+ permeability, and these characteristics have been widely used to establish rules
of AMPAR subunit plasticity. Molecular layer interneurons of the cerebellum provide a well-established model
system for understanding AMPAR localization and trafficking because repetitive synaptic stimulation or a single
experience of fear triggers a form of plasticity called subunit-switching wherein CP-AMPARs at synapses are
replaced by CI-AMPARs from a pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs. Although rectification index and sensitivity to
polyamine site toxins are widely used to distinguish between GluR2-containing and -lacking AMPARs, there
are many examples from the literature that show these biophysical properties do not exclusively reflect subunit
composition. A separate literature has converged on gating models of AMPARs that include multiple
conductance states, but the functional implications are unclear. Now, our preliminary data show that CP-AMPAR rectification and pharmacology are sensitive to factors that regulate AMPAR conductance states,
potentially complicating the interpretation of results using these biophysical properties as sole proxies of
subunit composition. We propose to understand how the multiple sub-conductance states of AMPARs
contribute to the hallmark biophysical properties CP-AMPARs. We will use high resolution Ca2+ imaging,
heterologous expression systems and genetic manipulation to understand regulation of CP-AMPAR
biophysical properties and use that understanding to critically evaluate CP-AMPAR localization and plasticity in
cerebellar molecular layer interneurons.
AMPAR subunit composition has important functional consequences,
ranging from regulating the ability of postsynaptic cells to precisely follow high-frequency synaptic activity and
mediating Ca2+ influx that can trigger plasticity or pathology. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
reveal novel properties of AMPARs that are essential for understanding their function within synapses and
intact circuits in the normal and diseased brain.","The goal of this project is to understand the biophysical properties of a type of glutamate receptor that
is permeable to calcium. Calcium-permeable glutamate receptors are important for brain development
and plasticity, and have been implicated in many disease states. The results of these studies will
expand our knowledge of activity-dependent brain development and plasticity.",2019,423055,288388,134667,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Neurosciences,Jacques  Wadiche
5R01GM127584-02,The Role of Sex Dimorphism in Post-TBI Bacterial Pneumonia,"Project Summary/Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of injury-related death in patients under the age of 46 years.
Survivors of the initial brain injury face numerous extracranial complications that are a major determinant of
long-term outcome and impede their most productive years of life. Post-TBI pulmonary infection rate is as high
as 50-60% and results in an infection-related mortality rate of ~30%. Additionally, after severe TBI, the
parasympathetic nervous system is activated to attenuate the systemic inflammatory response and may
prevent some post-TBI, non-brain end-organ injury. However, parasympathetic nervous system activation may
be maladaptive and result in dysregulation of alveolar macrophage and neutrophil immune function within the
lung. Our preliminary data reveal increased mortality after post-TBI pneumonia that is Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (Î±7nAChR)-dependent. Î±7nAChR activation inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced release of
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and nuclear factor-ÎºÎ² (NF- ÎºÎ²) activation in alveolar macrophages.
Additionally, Î±7nAChR activation inhibits phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by alveolar macrophages.
Interestingly, female patients have a lower incidence of post-TBI lung infection compared to males with
equivalent TBI severity. Female mice have lower mortality and decreased lung bacterial burden after post-TBI
pneumonia compared to males. Oophorectomized females have a post-TBI P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia
mortality rate similar to males and males that receive estrogen after TBI and just before onset of bacterial
pneumonia have improved survival. Finally, estrogen inhibits the effects of Î±7nAChR activation and restores
appropriate TNF-Î± release, NF- ÎºÎ² activation and phagocytic function. Thus, the question of how estrogen
alleviates the Î±7nAChR-dependent maladaptive response and improves survival from secondary pneumonia in
TBI patients is of great clinical importance. Based on our preliminary data, we use a reverse translational
approach to hypothesize that parasympathetic-induced, Î±7nAChR-mediated dysregulation of alveolar
macrophage and neutrophil immune function leads to decreased lung bacterial clearance and survival
in post-TBI P. aeruginosa-induced lung infection and is alleviated by estrogen. To test this hypothesis,
we propose three specific aims: (Aim 1) Î±7nAChR activation leads to a dysregulated, maladaptive innate
immune response leading to decreased lung bacterial clearance and survival after post-TBI P. aeruginosa
infection; (Aim 2) Sex differences in parasympathetic-induced Î±7nAChR maladaptive signaling leading to lung
innate immune dysfunction are alleviated by estrogen; (Aim 3) Examine the sex differences in response to
Î±7nAChR activation of innate immune cells after TBI in humans. These findings will elucidate maladaptive
Î±7nAChR signaling and its molecular mechanisms leading to decreased lung innate immune function in post-
TBI bacterial pneumonia and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse these effects and improve
post-TBI patient mortality and long-term outcomes during their most productive years of life.","Project Narrative
Bacterial pneumonia after severe TBI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients <46 years old
that has detrimental effects on long-term outcome during their most productive years of life. Furthermore,
clinical studies and our preliminary data suggest that Î±7nAChR-mediated signaling may be responsible for
decreased lung innate immunity, there are physiologic sex differences in Î±7nAChR activation and estrogen
may alleviate maladaptive Î±7nAChR signaling. In this application, we will study the effects of Î±7nAChR-
medaited innate immune dysfunction, sex differences therein and estrogen as a pharmaceutical strategy to
prevent post-TBI bacterial pneumonia in male and post-menopausal females.",2019,334125,225000,109125,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Estrogen; Infectious Diseases; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Injury - Trauma - (Head and Spine); Injury - Traumatic brain injury; Lung; Neurosciences; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza,Brant M Wagener
7R01CA196566-04,Nucleoporin NUP205-driven Novel Pathway in Melanoma Tumor Growth and Metastasis,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules is a highly specific and tightly regulated process that occurs exclusively through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NPC is composed of approximately 30 proteins, termed nucleoporins, which play crucial roles in several biological processes. Although, chromosomal translocation involving some nucleoporins are observed in hematological malignancies, however, their role in solid tumors is not known. Therefore, to study the role of nucleoporins in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis, we developed an integrative genomics approach by combining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) melanoma sample dataset analyses with functional genomics approach of an in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) screening. This approach identified NUP205 as the only nucleoporin that is essential for tumor growth and metastasis of BRAF- and NRAS-mutant melanoma. Additional experiments revealed that NUP205 confers anoikis resistance and stimulates MAK kinase and WNT signaling pathways. Based on these results, we hypothesize that NUP205 by regulating MAP kinase and WNT signaling pathways drives melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. The overall objective is to determine the role and mechanism of NUP205 in tumor growth and metastasis and test if NUP205-driven pathway can be targeted to treat melanoma. In Aim 1, we will determine the in vivo role of NUP205 in melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. To this end, using in vivo mouse models of melanoma tumor growth and organ-specific and spontaneous mouse models of melanoma metastasis, we will determine the role of NUP205 in facilitating melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism of NUP205 action. Based on our results, we will test whether the ability of NUP205 to stimulate MAP kinase via Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) and/or WNT signaling pathway via heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS2ST1) is required for it to confer anoikis resistance and promote melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. In Aim 3, we will determine the utility of targeting NUP205 regulated pathway for melanoma therapy. First, we will test if pharmacological inhibition of NUP205 downstream effector HS2ST1 enzyme by small molecule inhibitors can block metastatic tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, because NUP205 protein stabilization can confer resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib, therefore, we will determine if inhibition of its downstream effector HS2ST1 can restore sensitivity to vemurafenib and prevent emergence of drug resistance. Clinical significance of these results will be established by analyzing pre- and post- vemurafenib treatment melanoma patient samples for the expression of NUP205 and its downstream effectors. Collectively, we expect to uncover a novel NUP205-driven druggable genetic vulnerability pathway that can be targeted for treating metastatic and drug resistant melanoma.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, accounts for âˆ¼10,000 deaths annually in the United States and current therapies only provide short-term clinical benefit. We have discovered that nucleoporin NUP205 is essential for melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. We expect that our studies will uncover a novel NUP205-driven druggable genetic vulnerability pathway of melanoma tumor growth and metastasis and validate effective drug targets for treating melanoma, including highly aggressive metastatic, NRAS-mutant and drug resistant melanoma.",2019,329502,221887,107615,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome,Narendra  Wajapeyee
5R21CA229927-03,A DRUGGABLE CHROMATIN MODIFIER PATHWAY IN HCC,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for nearly 29,000 deaths annually in the United States alone.
However, the molecular mechanisms that drive HCC development remain elusive and current HCC therapies
provide negligible clinical benefit. Factors that epigenetically silence an HCC tumor suppressor gene have the
potential to promote tumorigenesis and thus may provide novel drug targets for HCC therapies. To discover
such factors, we performed an innovative genome-wide human RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify
factors that mediate epigenetic silencing of the HCC tumor suppressor gene Hedgehog-Interacting Protein
(HHIP). HHIP is a negative regulator of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and loss of HHIP due to epigenetic
silencing aberrantly activates SHH signaling, which has been proposed to promote tumor growth in multiple
cancers including HCC. One of the factors identified in our screen is Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a histone
deacetylase involved in epigenetic gene silencing. Notably, epigenetic silencing of HHIP and HDAC9
overexpression occur frequently in HCC patient samples, supporting the clinical relevance of our results.
Based on these results, we hypothesize that HDAC9 is a driver of HCC initiation and growth that functions by
epigenetically silencing the tumor suppressor HHIP gene. The overall objective is to determine the role of
HDAC9 in HCC initiation and growth, determine its mechanism-of-action and evaluate it as a drug target for
HCC treatment. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of HDAC9 in driving HCC initiation and tumor growth.
Towards this end, first using cell culture models of HCC, we will test if HDAC9 can transform immortalized
hepatocytes. Additionally, we will test if HDAC9 can initiate HCC in vivo. For this purpose, we will use a
genetically-defined mouse model of HCC initiation and a novel mouse model that we have developed to
recapitulate human liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis (also known as cirrhosis) is a cardinal feature of HCC and is
shown to promote HCC initiation and tumor growth. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism-of-HDAC9-
action. Our preliminary results allow us to predicts that tumor growth, which is inhibited following loss of
HDAC9, can be restored by the simultaneous loss of HHIP or constitutive activation of SHH signaling. In this
aim, experiments are proposed to rigorously test both of these predictions. We will also investigate other
mechanisms by which HDAC9 may promote tumor growth, such as epigenetic silencing of a tumor suppressor
gene other than HHIP. In Aim 3, we will evaluate pharmacological targeting of HDAC9 for HCC therapy.
Towards this end, we will ascertain if in vivo pharmacological targeting using HDAC9 inhibitor TMP195 can
effectively eradicate HCC tumor growth in vivo. For this purpose, we will use orthotopic mouse model of HCC
tumor growth and progression. Collectively, the results of our experiments will elucidate a novel druggable
epigenetic vulnerability pathway that drives HCC and validate the utility of HDAC9 targeting for effective HCC
therapy.","PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE
Nearly 29,000 Americans die from hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma (HCC) every year and current treatments
for HCC provide no long-term benefit, highlighting the urgent need for new and effective therapies. We have
discovered that a protein called HDAC9 is required for the growth of HCC tumors, and found that inhibiting
HDAC9 blocks HCC tumor growth. The results of the experiments proposed in this application will establish
HDAC9 as a novel drug target for the development of new and effective HCC therapies.!",2019,180056,121250,58806,Non-SBIR/STTR,R21,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Liver Cancer; Liver Disease; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases,Romi  Gupta; Narendra  Wajapeyee

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 76,000 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone and regrettably 10,000 of these patients will die of their disease. Oncogenic mutations in NRAS and BRAF genes are present in over 75% of melanoma. However, currently there is no effective treatment for NRAS mutant melanoma and targeted therapies against BRAF mutant melanoma fail to provide long-term clinical benefits due to rapid emergence of drug resistance. We postulated that identifying novel Druggable Genetic Vulnerability (DGV) pathways will lead to the development of alternative and effective therapies for NRAS mutant and targeted therapy resistant BRAF mutant melanoma. Towards this end, by employing an innovative approach of an in vivo druggable genome RNAi screen, we identified LIM-domain Kinase 2 ( LIMK2) as a novel drug target in melanoma. RNAi and CRISPR/CAS9-based inhibition of LIMK2 blocked the tumor and metastatic growth of NRAS- and BRAF-mutant melanoma and LIMK2 overexpression conferred resistance to BRAF- and MEK- targeted therapies. Our central hypothesis is that LIMK2 regulates a druggable genetic vulnerability pathway in NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma, which is also important for conferring resistance to targeted therapies. The overall objective is to determine the role of LIMK2 in melanoma initiation and progression, understand its mechanism-of-action and evaluate LIMK2 as a drug target for melanoma therapy. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of LIMK2 in melanoma initiation and metastatic progression. Towards this end, we will first determine if LIMK2 is necessary for oncogenic NRAS/BRAF-induced transformation. Additionally, based on our results that LIMK2 promotes invasion and survival of circulating melanoma cells by conferring anoikis resistance, we will determine the in vivo role of LIMK2 in melanoma metastasis using xenograft- based organ-specific and spontaneous mouse model of melanoma metastasis. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which LIMK2 sustain tumor and metastatic growth of NRAS/BRAF mutant melanoma. Towards this end, based on the results of our unbiased high-throughput approaches of transcriptome-wide mRNA sequencing and Tandem Affinity Purification/Mass spectrometry analysis, we will evaluate the role of a novel LIMK2 substrate Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) as a potential downstream mediator of LIMK2 function in melanoma. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of LIMK2 in conferring resistance to BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies and evaluate its utility as a drug target in melanoma. Towards this end, we will determine if LIMK2-driven DGV pathway inhibition prevents or delay emergence of resistance to BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapies and if systemic pharmacological inhibition of LIMK2 is effective in treating metastatic and BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapy resistant melanoma in vivo in xenograft-based and genetic mouse models of melanoma growth and metastasis. Taken together, our proposal will uncover a novel DGV pathway that can be pharmacologically targeted for treating metastatic and drug resistant melanoma.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Melanoma account for over 85% of skin cancer-related deaths and due to the lack of effective therapies that provide durable clinical benefits only 15% of metastatic melanoma patients survive beyond 5 years. Using an innovative in vivo druggable genome RNAi screen, we discovered a kinase LIMK2 as a novel drug target in metastatic and BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapy resistant melanoma. The proposed experiments will significantly improve our molecular understanding of melanoma biology and therapy response and validate the effectiveness of pharmacological targeting of a novel LIMK2 driven pathway for treating highly aggressive metastatic and targeted therapy resistant melanoma.",2019,198647,133769,64878,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Prevention,Narendra  Wajapeyee

It is easy to underestimate the importance of normal movement in daily life, until that ability is altered or taken
away by disease. Used in more than 150,000 patients worldwide, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often an
effective therapy for Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, however symptomatic improvement
varies substantially in individuals, across clinical trials, and over time. DBS is now proposed for earlier disease
stages in Parkinson's disease and for new indications in neurology and psychiatry, potentially exposing larger
numbers of patients to this invasive therapy. Emerging segmented or â€œdirectionalâ€ DBS lead technology
provides unprecedented opportunities to optimize clinical improvement and tolerability and to drive innovation
in neuromodulation. We have pioneered new putative biomarkers that measure patient-specific cortical
physiology elicited by DBS with combined electrocorticography and electroencephalography. Our findings
demonstrate robust within-participant changes in cortical activation that distinguish effective versus ineffective
stimulation sites. Here we will leverage this knowledge to guide efficient implementation of current steering
with novel directional DBS lead technology. Our primary goal is to deliver innovative approach to tailor and
optimize field shaping with novel directional lead technology to improve the efficacy and tolerability of DBS in
patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Additionally, our results will provide foundational knowledge (1)
to better understand the concept of DBS dose; (2) to refine surgical targeting in real time; (3) and to inform
emerging closed loop stimulation paradigms.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01GM130696-01A1,Remodeling and Spacing Factor 1 in Histone H2A Ubiquitination-Mediated Gene Silencing,"Posttranslational modifications of histones play important roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and
function. Histone H2A ubiquitination is a predominant modification important for a variety of cellular processes.
We have previously discovered that Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), a fundamental developmental
regulator, acts as a ubiquitin ligase for H2AK119 ubiquitination (H2AK119ub). This study links H2AK119ub to
PRC1-mediated gene silencing of key developmental genes and the essential roles of PRC1 in cell identity,
tumorigenesis, and genomic imprinting. Several proteins have been shown to bind H2AK119ub; however, how
this modification elicits downstream gene silencing events remains largely obscure. We recently identified
Remodeling and Spacing Factor 1 (RSF1) as a novel H2AK119ub-binding protein, providing a gateway to dissect
the mechanism of action of H2AK119ub. We discovered that RSF1 binds H2AK119ub through a previously
uncharacterized region designated as the ubiquitinated H2A binding (UAB) motif, and that RSF1 is required both
for silencing of H2AK119ub target genes and for maintaining the normal H2AK119ub nucleosome pattern at
promoter regions. We further demonstrated that, during Xenopus early embryonic development, RSF1 regulates
mesodermal cell specification and gastrulation in a fashion similar to Ring1, a Xenopus PRC1 subunit mediating
H2AK119ub. Although these studies reveal that RSF1, as a H2AK119ub-binding protein, is required for
H2AK119ub target gene repression, it remains to be established that reading the H2AK119ub mark is the
mechanism by which RSF1 represses gene expression. Here, we propose a series of structural, in vitro, and in
vivo studies to delineate the mechanism of action of RSF1 in H2AK119ub function. We hypothesize that RSF1
is a key reader of H2AK119 ubiquitination that mediates its roles in gene silencing, chromatin
remodeling, and development. We propose to address three questions critical to this hypothesis: 1) how does
RSF1 specifically recognize H2AK119ub nucleosomes? 2) how does RSF1 modulate the organization of
H2AK119ub chromatin? and 3) what is the significance of RSF1 in H2AK119ub-regulated physiological
processes? Given the fundamental roles of PRC1 and RSF1 in cell fate determination during normal
development and the extensive involvement of PRC1 and RSF1 in cancer development, these studies will
significantly advance our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms controlling normal development as well
as pathogenic processes.","Genes regulated by PRC1, the ubiquitin ligase for histone H2AK119 ubiquitination, are essential in both normal
development and disease pathology. Understanding how H2AK119ub represses gene expression will have a
major impact on our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms mediating development and on our ability to
elaborate strategies to target this epigenetic system for therapeutic purposes.",2019,297000,200000,97000,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Genetics,HENGBIN  WANG
5R01HL138470-03,The role of planar cell polarity signaling in outflow tract malformation in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"Malformation of the outflow tract (OFT) is one of the most common congenital heart defects (CHD) in humans
and a leading cause of childhood lethality. Their etiology, however, is largely unknown as most CHDs are
thought to be complex genetic disorders arising from mutations in multiple genes. The long-term objectives of
this project are to define how different pathways interact to regulate OFT morphogenesis, to identify the
genetic mutations/ variants altering these pathways in humans, and to elucidate how the mutations/ variants
interact to modify OFT malformations. The knowledge will guide us to design diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches. In humans with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (DS), heterozygous loss of TBX1, a T-box
transcription factor, predisposes them to CHDs at a high rate of 65%. The highly variable clinical manifestation
of OFT defects in 22q11.2DS individuals with the identical deletion has led to the hypothesis that genetic
variants, residing outside the deletion and affecting TBX1-networks, may interact with TBX1 haploinsufficiency
to modify the clinical presentation of OFT malformation. The objective of the current proposal is to understand
how alteration of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism that
regulates tissue morphogenesis, may contribute to OFT malformation in 22q11.2DS patients. The objective will
be achieved by specifically testing 1) how Tbx1 may regulate morphogenesis in cardiac progenitors in the
second heart field (SHF) through PCP signaling to promote OFT formation in mice; 2) how 3 functionally
validated PCP genes variants identified in 22q11.2DS patients may modify the OFT defects in Tbx1 mutant
mice, and 3) how additional predicted risk and protective PCP gene variants found in 22q11.2DS patients may
alter PCP signaling activity. Building upon our preliminary studies that PCP regulates cell polarity and polarized
cell behavior to promote SHF morphogenesis and SHF cell deployment to the OFT, we will first determine how
Tbx1 mutants may phenocopy the morphogenetic defects in PCP mutants, and whether constitutively
activating PCP in the SHF may rescue SHF morphogenesis and OFT defects in Tbx1 mutants. Secondly, we
will use CRISPR/Cas9 to create mouse models for three human PCP variants that we already discovered from
22q11.2DS patients and functionally validated in Xenopus, and test how variants dampening or enhancing
PCP activity may impact OFT malformations in Tbx1 mutant mice. Finally, using a quantitative assay we
established in Xenopus, we will systematically analyze a large number of rare predicted PCP gene variants
associated specifically with 22q11.2DS individual either with or without OFT defects, and perform cellular and
molecular studies to determine mechanistically how these variant alter PCP signaling. These studies will
elucidate whether perturbation of PCP signaling is a key pathogenic mechanism of OFT malformation in
22q11.2DS, and how PCP gene variants may impact human biology and human health.","The spectrum of OFT defects in 22q11.2DS is also observed in nonsyndromic CHD
cases in the general population, suggesting that there are likely shared mechanisms
between syndromic and non-syndromic CHDs. So this project holds much promise to not
only help us identify pathogenic mechanisms of OFT malformation in 22q11.2DS, but
also unravel the genetic susceptibility factors that may underlie large number of
nonsyndromic CHD cases. Identification of risk and protective PCP gene variants
contributing to the incomplete penetrance of OFT malformation in 22q11.2DS will
provide invaluable information for genetic diagnosis and consultation, and may also shed
light on the design of therapeutic interventions to prevent or reduce the occurrence of
OFT malformations in the future.",2019,652745,479696,173049,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Rare Diseases,CHENBEI  CHANG; Jianbo  Wang
5R01GM120159-03,Development of Structurally Defined Synthetic Vaccine Adjuvants,"Adjuvants are substances that enhance the ability of a vaccine to elicit strong and durable immune
responses to specific antigens. They are a key factor in developing subunit vaccines, and are in urgent need
and a priority for vaccine research. Despite recent progress, developing subunit vaccines is still bottlenecked
by the lack of safe and effective adjuvants. Discovery of novel adjuvants has emerged as a critical frontline
effort in vaccine research. Saponin immune adjuvants, especially the extracts from the Quillaja Saponaria (QS)
Molina tree bark, show promising adjuvant activity and are promising leads in developing structurally and
compositionally defined synthetic vaccine adjuvants. Among the only four purified and characterized
components of the complex tree bark extracts, the component QS-21 is one of the most sought-after human
vaccine adjuvants and has been evaluated in over 100 clinical trials of vaccines against cancers and various
infectious diseases. It is also a key component of the new adjuvant systems (e.g., AS01 and AS15) being
tested in over 20 current clinical trials by the pharmaceutical industry. However, naturally occurring QS
adjuvants have inherent drawbacks such as chemical instability, limited supply, difficult and low-yielding
purification, and dose-limiting toxicity, which are the serious hurdles to their wider clinical use. In spite of recent
efforts and progress in circumventing the limitations of QS-21, there remains an imperative need of structurally
defined and homogeneous QS saponin-based adjuvants with enhanced adjuvant activity, reduced toxicity,
simplified formulation, and much improved chemical stability and synthetic accessibility. Chemical synthesis is
currently the only viable way to access the variety of structurally defined unnatural QS saponins analogs in a
sufficient amount for adjuvant screenings and potential clinical application. In this application, we will focus on
the design, synthesis and immunological evaluations of new QS analogs.

of the east wing native fucose unit for easy side chain attachment.

1R01AG064664-01,Beta amyloid-adrenergic receptor interaction in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only cause of death among the top ten that cannot be prevented, cured,
or even slowed, making it urgent to identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AD. It is generally accepted
that toxic amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptides are the key pathogenic factor for AD. However, AD progression and clinical
presentation are highly heterogeneous and determined by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Therefore,
in order to develop effective disease-modifying therapies, it is necessary to fully understand the action of AÎ² and
identify underlying mechanisms that modulate its effects on cognitive functions. Our unpublished data revealed
that AÎ²42 oligomers (the major toxic species of AÎ² peptides) act as allosteric modulators with nanomolar affinity
for the Î±2A-adrenergic receptor (Î±2AAR). This is the first example in which AÎ² functions as an allosteric modulator
of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with nanomolar affinity. We found that AÎ²42 binding to Î±2AAR resulted
in aberrant coupling of Î±2AAR to activation of a new signaling effector that promotes neuronal dysfunction and
cognitive impairment. The AÎ²-dependent pathological coupling of Î±2AAR signaling provides a novel mechanism
underlying AÎ²-induced toxicity to brain function, and suggests that the AÎ²-Î±2AAR interaction represents a
potential disease-specific target for AD treatment. The primary objective of this proposal is to address the cellular
and molecular mechanisms and in vivo relevance of the AÎ²-Î±2AAR interaction in exacerbating AD-related
neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment using combined cellular, molecular and genetic approaches. We
will first determine the cellular aspect of detrimental effects induced by the AÎ²-Î±2AAR interaction in neurons.
Second, we will identify the molecular mechanism critical for AÎ²-dependent pathological coupling of Î±2AAR
signaling and determine the role of G proteins and Î²arrestins in this process. Third, we will determine the in vivo
functional relevance of the AÎ²-Î±2AAR interaction in exacerbating AD-related cognitive deficits. Successfully
accomplishing this study will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying AÎ² actions in disrupting cognitive function in AD. Targeting the disease-specific interaction between
AÎ² oligomers and Î±2AAR represents a potential safe and effective approach to improve cognitive function in AD.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of devastating late-life dementia and currently

The long-term goal of our studies is to define the molecular/cellular mechanisms whereby Î±2AAR functions are regulated, so as to enable the development of novel, effective therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor for disease treatment. Like most Gi/o-coupled receptors, the Î±2AAR can be localized in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments, and is well appreciated for its role in inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release.

1R03AG064652-01,Test the role of cardiac expressed SEMA6D in Alzheimer's disease,"Abstract
 The primary goal of this research is to test the feasibility of using mouse models to examine the effect of
congenital heart diseases (CHDs) on the onset and progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). CHDs are the most
common structural birth defects, occurring in 1-5% of newborns. Owing to the greatly improved diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies, ~90% of children with CHDs can now survive to adulthood. Adult CHD patients now
outnumber pediatric CHD patients by a ratio of 2:1. A growing number of adult CHD patients are aging, posing
new medical challenges in caring for these patients. A nationwide epidemiological study published in 2018
revealed that adults with CHDs have a significantly increased risk for developing AD compared to the general
population, and that the risk is particularly increased for early onset of dementia. Therefore, the early abnormal
heart development in embryos/neonates significantly increases the risk of later developing dementia/AD. The
long interval between the occurrence of CHDs and the onset of AD makes studies of the CHD-AD interaction
highly challenging. Thus, it is not entirely surprising that few, if any, such studies can be found in the literature.
Considering that both CHDs and AD have been heavily studied through mouse genetics, we propose to develop
mouse models to examine how CHDs affect AD. In our unpublished study, we used the cardiac troponin T (cTnt)
â€“Cre driver to specifically inactivate Sema6D in embryonic hearts. Mutant mice displayed the hypoplastic
myocardial wall defect at P0 due to reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation. We plan to crossbreed Sema6D
knockout mice with a well-established AD model line, APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in mice, to examine the impact of
inborn cardiomyopathy on AD-like deficits in mice. Our central hypothesis is that congenital cardiomyopathy
caused by embryonic heart deletion of Sema6D accelerates the onset and exacerbates the severity of AD-related
deficits in AD mice. We will examine the cognitive and neuropathological defects in these mice in Aims 1 and 2,
respectively. This project is highly innovative by nature. CHD is a newly identified risk factor for AD. Evaluating
how CHDs impact AD is a completely new area for AD research. Our study represents the first to test the
feasibility of using mouse models to study the CHD-AD interaction. Successfully accomplishing our research will
open the door for future in vivo studies in this field.","In this study, we will test the feasibility of using mouse models to examine the interaction between congenital

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects.

5R01DK115172-03,Mechanisms Controlling Regulatory T cell Effector Function in IBD,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanisms Controlling Regulatory T Cell Effector Function in IBD. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is characterized by immune dysregulation to components of the enteric microbiota. Findings from mouse
models of IBD and recent human genetic studies highlight a critical, non-redundant role for the immunoregulatory
cytokine IL-10 in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis. Our lab has shown that Foxp3+ regulatory T
(Treg) cells are, overwhelmingly, the major source of IL-10 in the intestines. However, IL-10 is only produced
by a subset of Treg cellsâ€”defined as â€˜effectorâ€™ (e)Treg cells. In preliminary studies that used an IL-10
transgenic reporter mouse model to explore differences between transcriptomes of T cells separated on the
basis of expression of IL-10, we identified the DNA-binding factor Gfi1 as a central repressor of Il10 gene
expression in all subsets of CD4 T cells, including Treg cells. Gfi1 appears to act both directly, via interactions
with the Il10 locus, and indirectly, by repressing transcription of Prdm1 (Blimp1), which is a trans-activator of
Il10 in Treg cells. Additionally, Gfi1 represses other genes that appear to be central to eTreg function,
suggesting that Gfi1 may play a key role in regulating the differentiation of eTreg cells. Finally, we have
identified cytokine signals that induce the expression of IL-10 by Foxp3+ Treg cells. In essence, IL-10
expression by Treg cells is Iatent and requires activating cytokine signals that repress Gfi1 to derepress
transcription of Il10 as part of eTreg cell programming. This could explain why IL-10 expression by T cells is
largely restricted to the intestines at homeostasis, where on-going responses to the microbiota provide a state
of controlled inflammation and a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote the development of IL-10â€“
expressing eTreg cells. We hypothesize that inflammatory signals in the gut override Gfi1-mediated repression
of eTreg cell development and that modulation of Gfi1 expression will impact the protective capabilities of Treg
cells in an inflammatory environmentâ€”in large part through modulation of IL-10 expression. Further, we posit
that Gfi1 maintains a pathogenic phenotype in CD4 T effector cells by repressing IL-10, such that inhibition of
Gfi1 will convert pathogenic T cells to IL-10â€“producing protective T cells, thereby ameliorating intestinal
disease. Herein, we will define mechanisms by which Gfi1 represses IL-10 in murine and human Treg cells and
we will perform proof-of-principle studies to examine the impact on IBD pathogenesis of dysregulated
expression of Gfi1 by T cells. The delineation of mechanisms by which cytokines modulate the Gfi1â€“Blimp1
axis to control IL-10 expression by T cells will lead to a better understanding of homeostatic networks that
prevent IBD, and will provide a basis for discovery of novel therapeutic approaches by which endogenous IL-
10 can be up-regulated, and the differentiation and function of eTreg cells enhanced, to treat IBD.","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of chronic immune disorders mediated by CD4 T cells
that have poorly restrained reactivity to the enteric microbiota. This proposal will elucidate mechanisms
that control the differentiation of regulatory T (Treg) cells into mature, effector Treg (eTreg) cells that
produce the immunoregultory cytokine, IL-10, and which act to curb the pathogenic potential of pro-
inflammatory CD4 T cells that drive IBD pathogenesis. We expect that results from these studies will
provide a basis for new interventions to curb pathogenic immunity to the microbiota in IBD.",2019,528163,355665,172498,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Crohn's Disease; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Microbiome,ROBIN D HATTON; Casey T Weaver
5R01DK113789-03,Specialization of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in Intestinal Barrier Function,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Specialization of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in Intestinal Barrier Function. Maintenance of
mucosal barrier integrity requires the interplay of innate and adaptive immune cells with the mucosal epithelium.
Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a cytokine of the IL-10 family that is produced by type 3 immune cells, such as group 3
innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and cells of the Th17 pathway, and acts on epithelial cells of barrier tissues to
prevent invasion of certain microbes, particularly extracellular bacteria and fungi. The basis for the protective
actions of IL-22 on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is not fully understood, but it enhances their production of
antimicrobial factors, maintains epithelial tight junctions and promotes the proliferation and survival of IECs.
Like many immune cytokines that participate in host defense, IL-22 is upregulated in chronic immune-mediated
diseases, and it appears to play a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), perhaps by restraining
the epithelial damage caused by dysregulated T cell responses against constituents of the intestinal
microbiome. However, the hyperproliferative effects of IL-22 have also been implicated in epithelial malignant
transformation that leads to colorectal cancer (CRC). We and others have shown that during infectious colitis
modeled by the enteropathogen, C. rodentium, two phases of IL-22 production can be distinguished: an early
phase dominated by IL-22â€“producing innate immune cells, and a late phase that is dominated by IL-22â€“
producing CD4 T cells. While both innate and adaptive immune cells produce IL-22 during infection, their
relative contributions to host protection are unknown, as are details of the mechanisms by which IL-22 acts. In
preliminary studies, we have generated novel IL-22 reporter/conditional knockout (cKO) mice with which to
track and/or delete specific subsets of IL-22-producing immune cells. Remarkably, we find that the locations
and functions of IL-22â€“producing cells during C. rodentium infection are distinct: innate immune cells,
dominated by ILC3s, localize primarily to isolated lymphoid follicles and activate superficial IECs at initial sites
of bacterial colonization. However, ILC3s fail to protect the intestinal crypts, which are invaded by bacteria in
mice with IL-22 deficiency targeted to T cells. Thus, IL-22â€“producing T cells appear to be indispensible for
protection of the intestinal crypts via their activation of crypt-lining epithelium. We hypothesize that IL-22â€“
producing innate cells are limited to rapid activation of superficial IECs at initial sites of bacterial attachment,
whereas IL-22â€“producing T cells are required to prevent bacterial invasion of crypts. Moreover, superficial and
crypt IECs differ in their response to IL-22-dependent innate and adaptive signals. In this proposal we will
define the relative contributions of innate and adaptive immune cells to IL-22â€“dependent activation of different
subsets of colonic epithelial cells, and define the gene expression programs elicited by IL-22 in the context of
innate or adaptive immune cell actions. These studies will reveal new insights into specialization of immune
cell subsets in intestinal host defense and mechanisms that control intestinal inflammation in IBD and CRC.","Specialization of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in Intestinal Barrier Function. This proposal

5F30NS100340-03,NF-kB Methyl-Lysine Signaling in the Epigenetic Regulation of Memory,"The overall goal of this proposal is to study the role of methyl-lysine signaling by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factor in the epigenetic control of gene transcription during memory formation. Specifically, it will investigate whether the NF-kB p65 subunit acts as an initiator of epigenetic mechanisms through its recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a-like protein (GLP), mediator of the histone 3 lysine 9 di-methyl mark (H3K9me2). The first specific aim will test the hypothesis that the lysine methyltransferase SETD6 regulates monomethylation of p65 at lysine 310 (p65K310me1) and H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation, and will characterize these changes. The second specific aim will test whether p65K310me1 promotes recruitment of GLP, thereby mediating H3K9me2 changes in the hippocampus during memory consolidation. The rationale for these investigations stems from recent studies in which SETD6 was shown to mediate p65K310me1, thereby promoting recruitment of GLP and subsequent H3K9me2. However, this mechanism has only been demonstrated in vitro, in the context of immune cells. Whether this occurs in the brain in response to learning, or is critical for memory consolidation is currently unknown. Similarly, whether p65 methylation mediates an epigenetic program of transcriptional control with behavioral consequences has not yet been investigated. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that p65K310me1 increases during memory consolidation. Furthermore, we have shown that p65 interacts with SETD6 in the rat hippocampus and that knockdown of SETD6 in the dorsal hippocampus results in impaired fear memory consolidation. Building on these findings, we will use Western blot analysis, chromatin and co- immunoprecipitation to measure p65K310me1, p65-GLP interaction, and H3K9me2 changes following knockdown and overexpression of SETD6 in vivo. Next, we will mimic p65K310me1 using plasmids to induce expression of constitutively-methylated p65K310. Finally, we will use ChIP-Seq to interrogate H3K9me2 changes across the genome following SETD6 knockdown during memory consolidation and identify memory- critical genes to explain our behavioral findings. Relevance to public health: Granted that many cognitive disorders feature changes in the epigenetic control of gene expression and that NF-ÎºB plays a known role in the epigenetic pathophysiology of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, the proposed experiments will begin to establish the mechanisms by which transcription factors initiate epigenetic changes in the brain. Moreover, these studies may identify new therapeutic strategies to mitigate cognitive symptoms of psychiatric conditions related to traumatic memories, such as post-traumatic stress disorders, phobias, and depression.","Initiation of epigenetic mechanisms governing gene transcription during memory formation are poorly understood. In this study, we seek to investigate the role of NF-kB p65 methylation and its effect on histone methylation in the brain.

live and health disparities have been particularly persistent. The Analysis Core (AnC) will support the vision
and activities of the Deep South RCMAR by providing mentoring and training of Scientists in the areas of
methods, measurement, and secondary data analysis as it relates to health disparities and minority aging. The
AnC will achieve this goal by leveraging existing expertise, data resources, and infrastructure at our four
partnering institutions (The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Morehouse School of Medicine, Tuskegee
University, and The University of Alabama). The AnC aims consist of a three-fold strategy. First, we will
collaborate with the Research Education Component (REC) and the Community Liaison and Recruitment Core
(CLRC) to mentor and train Scientists in methods and measurement techniques related to the study of health
disparities of older African Americans in the Deep South. This will include: a) conducting training in methods,
measurement, and secondary data analysis focused on health disparities/minority aging; and b) facilitating
linkage of Scientists with methodological, biostatistical, and analytical resources available within the Deep
South RCMAR. Second, in collaboration with the REC and the CLRC, we will mentor and train Scientists in the
conduct of secondary data analyses using sociobehavioral, economic, clinical, and genetic data, with the goal
of informing the development and evaluation of interventions to address health disparities among older African
Americans in the Deep South. This will include: a) conducting training in the analysis of secondary data with a
focus on data with Deep South RCMAR expertise; and b) facilitating mentoring of Scientists in the analysis of
secondary data by establishing workgroups comprised of Deep South RCMAR senior and junior investigators
with expertise in datasets relevant to minority aging and health disparities. Finally, we will collaborate with the
national RCMAR Coordinating Center in the dissemination of culturally sensitive measures and secondary data
analysis techniques relevant to minority aging.",,2019,59869,40316,19553,Research Centers,P30,National Institute on Aging,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Clinical Research; Rural Health,Robert  Weech-Maldonado
5R01AI061061-15,Molecular characterization of the role for T-bet and Bcl-6 in immune cell metabolism and differentiation,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lineage-specifying transcription factors coordinate a diverse array of cellular processes for the appropriate differentiation of the cell. In CD4+ T cell, the T-box transcription factor T-bet is required for the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, whereas the BTB-zinc finger (ZF) factor Bcl-6 is required for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell
development. Importantly, the balance between these two lineage-specifying factors also influences the effector versus memory cell transition in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To date, our understanding of the gene expression programs that the balance between T-bet and Bcl-6 regulate to control the effector versus memory transition have been incomplete. Recent research in the field has highlighted the importance of metabolic states in the differentiation and
functional potential of immune cells. In T cells, a high rate of glycolysis is needed for effector ell differentiation whereas the glycolysis pathway is dampened in favor of the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway in memory cells. Notably, artificially inhibiting the glycolytic pathway in CD8+ T cells can effectively promote memory cell differentiation. Thus, the regulation of cellular metabolism is important for the effector versus memory cell transition and targeting the metabolic state of T cells represents a novel way to control this decision in autoimmune states and vaccine strategies. In new research from my laboratory, we have shown for that the balance between T-bet and Bcl-6 is important for the IL-2-sensitive regulation of the glycolysis gene expression program. Our new data suggest that at least in part, the close connection between cellular metabolism and differentiation states is because these processes are mechanistically regulated by a similar complement of lineage-specifying transcription factors. In this proposal we will define how different environmental conditions in vitro and microenvironments in vivo influence the expression of the metabolic gene program and metabolite accumulation in effector versus memory T cells, and determine the role for the balance between T-bet and Bcl-6 in these processes. We will also define the role for metabolites in regulating specialization programs in T cells and whether T-bet and Bcl-6 contribute to targeting their activities. This is a critical new direction of research to pursue because it has the potential to provide new therapeutic opportunities to redirect immune cell differentiation using clinically approved metabolic inhibitors. In the case of memory cell development, this will aid in vaccination strategies for viruses such as HIV and HCV where robust long-term memory responses have not yet been achieved. For autoimmune conditions, this has the potential to dampen the aberrant activities that cause tissue specific pathologies. Therefore, the basic knowledge gained in these studies will increase our future potential to logically target metabolic pathways to enhance immunity and treat conditions caused by pathogenic immune responses.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lineage-specifying transcription factors play a critical role in controlling immune cell development. Aberrant expression of these factors result in pathogenic states such as immune disorders, failure to control infections, ineffective vaccines and blood cancers.

1R01HL148215-01,Matrikines and COPD-PH,"Project Summary / Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disorder characterized by abnormally elevated pulmonary artery (PA)
pressures and PH associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent, is
associated increased morbidity and mortality, and lacks therapeutic options. Thus new pathways and
therapeutic targets are needed to address this critical need.
Recent work in our laboratory has identified the biologically active extracellular matrix fragment (matrikine)
acetyl-proline-glycine-proline (AcPGP) as a key marker for COPD pathogenesis. PGP acts on inflammatory
cells through CXC receptors (CXCR1/2) and signaling through the CXCR2 receptor has implications in PH
development. We believe that the matrikine AcPGP causes pulmonary vasculopathy in COPD, leading to PH.
We will test this hypothesis through the following independent but inter-related aims:
1. To determine the causative role for AcPGP-mediated signaling in models of PH
2. To elucidate mechanisms for matrikine-mediated pulmonary vascular remodeling
3. To evaluate the impact of matrikines on clinical features of COPD-PH
This project explores new concepts in the pathobiology of COPD-PH through the use of novel animal models of
PH, pulmonary vascular cell models, and applies these findings to a unique human cohort. The preclinical
models tested will evaluate pathways and key therapeutic targets that could ultimately be tested in humans with
COPD-PH. If successful, this project would provide the foundation by which these new therapies could be
applied in a disease that currently has no treatment, potentially affecting the lives of patients affected with these
devastating illnesses.","Project Narrative
Pulmonary hypertension occurs in patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
there are no therapies that alter the natural history of these combined diseases. Both conditions are
characterized by complex interactions between different pathologic processes and extracellular matrix
remodeling. Exploring new pathways involved in the remodeling process may lead to novel therapies for
COPD-associated pulmonary hypertension.",2019,470756,317007,153749,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Lung,JAMES MICHAEL WELLS
5R01HL133011-03,Glucose-Mediated Remodeling of Cardiac DNA Methylation,"Despite overall reductions in heart disease, the increased risk of developing heart failure has
remained 2-fold greater among people with diabetes. Evidence from our laboratory and others has
identified that fluctuations in glucose level and uptake directly contributes to cardiovascular disease
(CVD) by modifying proteins, DNA, and gene expression. In the case of glucose, clinical studies have
shown that following tight glycemic control, susceptibility to disease progression is sustained years or
even decades in a process termed â€œglycemic memoryâ€. A long-term goal of our laboratory is to
understand the role of glucose in the formation of glycemic memory and determine if these changes
alter disease progression. Recently the mechanism of epigenetic regulation, which consists of
modifications of the histone proteins that help package DNA and direct modifications of the DNA (e.g.
methylation), is linked to glycemic memory. A critical barrier in determining the molecular
mechanisms has been the ability to place the marks in the intact heart to test disease susceptibility.
Two novel advances have taken place over the last 2-5 years that place the glucose-mediated protein
post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, at the forefront of this quest. Specifically, O-
GlcNAcylation is part of the histone code. Secondly, the proteins that regulate O-GlcNAcylation
interact with the proteins that tailor DNA methylation, providing a second link between glucose and
epigenetics. The objective of the current proposal is to determine the mechanism by which
fluctuations in glucose alter DNA methylation and how these changes alter gene expression and
cardiac function. As diabetes and heart failure are diseases with strong metabolic components, we
will focus on how glucose-mediated epigenetic changes alter metabolism and energetics in acquired
heart disease. We have developed two novel mouse models to test this hypothesis. The first builds
upon our model of inducible cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the glucose transporter, GLUT4,
and the second is a new model of cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc regulation. Thus uniquely allowing us to
directly test the role that cardiomyocyte glucose delivery and GlcNAcylation have on CVD. Our
preliminary data define persistent DNA methylation changes that increase susceptibility to pressure-
overload hypertrophy. In this proposal we will: determine the mechanism of altered DNA methylation
(Aim 1), determine if these epigenetic modifications alter contractile and metabolic dysfunction in
response to a common diabetic co-morbidity of hypertension (Aim 2), and determine if O-GlcNAc
alone is sufficient to increase disease susceptibility (Aim 3). Collectively, the completion of these
studies will provide fundamental insights into the mechanistic basis for glucose in the regulation of
cardiac gene expression contributing to the development of diabetic CVD.","There is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with history of poor control of
glucose levels that in turn alter gene expression through modifications of DNA in the cell. These
changes, termed epigenetics, contribute to increased susceptibility to heart failure. To determine the
mechanism of this we have developed two mouse models in which we can turn on and off glucose
delivery or increase protein post-translational glycosylation (O-GlcNAc) in the cardiomyocyte and
directly determine if the observed changes in DNA methylation increase susceptibility to pressure-
overload induced hypertrophy.",2019,371250,250000,121250,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Genetics; Heart Disease,Adam Raymond Wende
5P50NS108675-02,Project 3: LRRK2 mediated macrophage responses in PD,"Project 3- Summary â€œLRRK2 mediated macrophage responses in PDâ€
 Post-mortem studies show that brains susceptible to Parkinson disease (PD) develop Î±-
synuclein inclusions in vulnerable neurons together with immune cell activation. Peripheral immune
cells are recruited to the most vulnerable brain regions such as the substantia nigra pars compacta.
Historically the interpretation of immune cell activation in the PD brain and pathogenesis has been
difficult to understand. However, recent genetic and transcriptomic profiling studies using new
sequence databases and gene ontology compendia show that immune cell function may underlie
much of the heritable aspects of PD susceptibility. These recent studies highlight a gene known as
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 in driving some of the connection between immune function and PD
susceptibility. Rare genetic variants in LRRK2 are among the most common known genetic causes of
PD. In the P20 Exploratory center, we found that LRRK2 protein is highly expressed in peripheral
macrophages that are recruited nearby neurons in the brain that harbor Î±-synuclein inclusions.
Studies with global LRRK2-transgenic and knockout mice and rats suggest that LRRK2 may control
damaging pro-inflammatory responses in the brain through function in these macrophages.
 As part of the proposed Alabama Udall Center to study â€œInnate and Adaptive Immunity in
Parkinson Disease,â€ we will define peripheral macrophage responses driven by LRRK2 in Î±-synuclein
induced neurodegeneration. Using genetic, pharmacological, and transplantation approaches, we will
restrict LRRK2 activation and inhibition to the periphery and in bone-marrow derived immune cells in
rat models of Î±-synuclein induced neurodegeneration. In parallel, we will study LRRK2 function in
macrophages isolated from patient blood to determine whether LRRK2 mutations exacerbate pro-
inflammatory responses in PD susceptibility. Further, we will examine whether macrophage
responses from de novo PD patients with elevated LRRK2 expression show elevated pro-
inflammatory responses and whether these can be rescued with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors and RNAi
approaches. With this work, we hope to gain a better understanding of LRRK2 function in
macrophages in neurodegeneration and proof-of-principle therapeutic approaches that might be
explored for neuroprotection in LRRK2-linked PD.",,2019,352377,237291,115086,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Andrew B West
1R21AG059954-01A1,A Multidomain Approach to Preventing Dementia in African Americans: Cognitive Prescriptions,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites, and evidence suggests that
modifiable lifestyle factors account for much of this disparity. AAs also demonstrate poorer dementia
knowledge than Whites. Yet, virtually no multi-domain dementia prevention interventions have targeted AAs.
Lifespan approaches implementing behavioral therapies before manifestation of impairment may be
particularly advantageous, as dementia pathology may precede symptoms by over 20 years. The current study
will be the first to explore the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized approach dubbed Cognitive
Prescriptions (CogRx) in middle-aged AAs. This approach targets five lifestyle areas: Physical Activity,
Cognitive Activity, Diet, Sleep, and Social Activity. Deficiencies in these domains have been demonstrated
observationally as behavioral risk factors for dementia. These malleable domains may be especially viable
intervention targets, and may have positive secondary outcomes. At 3 and 6 months we will examine primary
(i.e., lifestyle changes and dementia knowledge) and secondary (i.e., cognitive function and psychological
function) outcomes across three groups: no-contact control, psychoeducation only, and psychoeducation +
CogRx. The psychoeducation will target general dementia knowledge, including prevalence, prognosis, and
general risk factor information, while the CogRx group will receive a tailored risk/protective factor profile across
the five aforementioned domains while also addressing barriers to these areas. The CogRx condition will
develop a tailored plan prioritizing deficient domains and integrate activities in their daily lives over the
following 3-months. The CogRx condition will receive daily text-messaging reminders and adherence queries
over the 3-months and will provide qualitative feedback for future implementation of this program at the 3-
month follow-up. The current study will overcome limitations of prior multi-domain cognitive interventions by: 1)
enrolling middle-aged adults with a focus on prevention, 2) examining a broad range of lifestyle domains, 3)
using self-initiated â€œprescriptionsâ€ for behavioral changes rather than structured lab-based interventions or
supplements/medications, 4) assessing adherence and self-efficacy, 5) tailoring the intervention to deficient
areas, 6) examining psychological/mental health outcomes, 7) examining dementia knowledge. The theoretical
underpinnings for this approach include the Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model, in that
providing tailored risk factor information (i.e., susceptibility), concrete goals, and outcome expectations while
also addressing self-efficacy and barriers will promote behavior change. The ultimate goal of this research is
to: 1) yield new perspectives for implementation of person-centered behavioral modification interventions
targeting cognitive outcomes in diverse populations, 2) impact clinical and public health recommendations for
maintaining cognitive health in aging populations, and 3) reduce racial disparities in dementia.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

5R01DK108836-04,HDL and Cellular Repair Mechanisms,"?  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Under normal physiological conditions, high density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important role in regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Beneficial properties of HDL have been ascribed, in large part, to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). Inflammation, however, can convert HDL into a dysfunctional lipoprotein particle that is depleted of apoA-I and enriched with acute phase proteins. Therapeutic approaches that increase plasma levels of functional HDL reduce ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and other inflammatory disorders. Previous studies show that apoA-I mimetic peptides exert anti-inflammatory effects by increasing functional HDL levels and inhibiting monocyte/macrophage (MÎ¦) infiltration in tissues. In this regard, it was shown that the
synthetic peptide 4F, which mimics functional properties of apoA-I, alters the metabolic profile of
human monocyte-derived MÎ¦s, resulting in the adoption of an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. These responses were associated with up-regulation of genes that regulate mitochondrial respiration, resulting in an increase in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP formation. In this application, we present data showing that 4F reduces hepatocellular injury in a murine model of hepatic I/R injury. The protective response to 4F treatment is thought to be due to an increase in circulating levels of functional HDL. Specifically, we show that Kupffer cells (KCs), tissue resident MÎ¦s, adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype. HDL may induce this response by increasing mitochondrial respiration and ATP formation, processes that support the induction of an anti-inflammatory wound healing response. Second, HDL may improve survival in hepatocytes via induction of autophagy, resulting in the clearance of damaged mitochondria and their replacement with new functional mitochondria. A mouse model of liver I/R will be used to test these hypotheses, and underlying mechanisms will be defined in cell culture systems.",PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interruption of organ blood flow promotes inflammation and free radical injury.

In response to RFA-AI-17-042, Centers of Excellence in Translational Research, we propose to develop small
molecule therapeutics for the treatment of emerging viral infections under the umbrella of the Antiviral Drug
Discovery and Development Center. We are a team of scientists experienced in virology, viral immunology,
pathogenesis, medicinal chemistry, and translation to human disease. We have established four Projects â€“ each
of which addresses infections identified as high priority by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID). Members of several genera of RNA viruses will be studied as they are major causes of human
disease, bioterrorist threats, or emerging infectious diseases. Pharmacological control of these viruses remains
limited. Our Projects will focus on (1) coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, (2) alphaviruses including
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and chikungunya, 3) flaviviruses including dengue, West Nile virus, and
Zika and 4) influenza A virus. We will utilize lead molecules identified in recent years by AD3C to perform
therapeutic proof of principle studies in animal models within the first two years of the grant. Importantly, we will
additionally evaluate a limited number of novel compounds provided by our collaborators, the Emory Institute for
Drug Discovery (EIDD) and Gilead Sciences in order to have back-up platforms to address the potential
development of resistance. Expertise exists in the AD3C for IND enabling studies, IND preparation and filing as
well as Phase I studies, should suitable candidates be identified. The projects are supported by three Cores: the
Administrative Core (Core A), the Assay Core (Core B), and the Medicinal Chemistry and Lead Development
Core (Core C). The organization and interaction between all Projects and Cores will be monitored by the
Administrative Core. An Executive Committee (EC) will consist of all Project and Core Leads to review data on
monthly conference calls, in order to provide further direction and foster project interactions. An external
Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will be established to provide evaluation of the project progress and
facilitate â€œGo/No-Goâ€ decisions on a regular basis. Since its inception, AD3C has already contributed significant
data to an IND filed for MERS and two patent applications for compounds with activity against chikungunya,
illustrating the success of our collaborative model.","OVERALL NARRATIVE

1U19AI142759-01,Project 4 - Influenza - UAB,"SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to identify new therapies that target influenza virus replication. The global
health burden of annual influenza infections and periodic epidemics coupled with the emergence of avian
influenza viruses, like H5NX and H7N9, highlight the urgent need for new effective treatments. A primary
concern with the current drugs used to treat influenza in the U.S. is the development of resistance mutations
that negate therapeutic benefit. Both published evidence and clinical experience suggest strongly that targeting
the influenza virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex is a rational approach for antiviral
therapy. This complex is responsible for many viral functions, including 5Â´ cap recognition, endonucleolytic
cleavage, RNA synthesis, and polyadenylation providing multiple functional domains as targets for antiviral
drug therapy and combination therapy. Agents can target the distinct functions and, theoretically, reduce the
minimize development of resistance since resistance mutations would likely reduce the fidelity of the RdRp.
One oral agent targeting the endonuclease domain, baloxavir, has shown efficacy in uncomplicated influenza
and was recently approved in Japan for treating influenza in adults and children. A second oral agent targeting
the 5Â´ cap binding domain, pimodivir, has shown antiviral activity in uncomplicated influenza and is advancing
in clinical development. A third oral agent, favipiravir, targeting the polymerase activity has been approved in
Japan for treating novel influenza strains not inhibited by neuraminidase inhibitors. We have recently identified
several potent molecules through a collaborative public private partnership that inhibit RdRp functions. This
research team provides the medicinal chemistry expertise, follow up assays, and in vivo experience to
transform active hits into lead compounds and promises to yield new classes of highly active molecules that

5U01CA223976-02,Biological Comparisons Among Three Derivative Models of Glioma Patient Cancers Under Microenvironmental Stress,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: 
Current methods of preclinical testing of potential therapeutics have been, for the most part, underwhelming in 
terms of their ability to yield a clinical impact. This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis 
has increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising 
preclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a) 
limitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To 
address these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-Â­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled 
with comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and 
other microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a 
careful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patientÂ­derived models (xenolines) of 
GBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D 
microtumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. 
These models preÂ­ and postÂ­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, 
transcriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to 
generate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMCâ€™s will 
improve both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent 
xenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system 
(GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines 
recapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the 
key hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow 
disaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the 
tumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we 
have preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient 
deprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes 
in kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de 
novo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the 
models with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness 
markers;Í¾ 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and 
determine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;Í¾ 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models 
of the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).","PROJECT NARRATIVE:

5K08CA234225-02,Myopenia and Mechanisms of Chemotherapy Toxicity in Older Adults with Colorectal Cancer: The M&M Study,"Abstract
 Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the 2nd most common cause of cancer death in the US with the majority of
diagnoses occurring in older adults (â‰¥65y). Older adults with CRC are at increased risk for severe treatment-
related toxicities and other adverse outcomes. The heterogeneous aging process evident in older adults
complicates the treatment of CRC and results in significant variability in outcomes. Understanding the variability
in chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with CRC is necessary to personalize treatments and improve outcomes.
Low muscle mass, known as myopenia, is highly prevalent in older adults. Losses in skeletal muscle mass are
apparent as early as the 4th decade of life and progress linearly with increasing age. In CRC, low muscle mass
is associated with increased chemotherapy-related toxicities and decreased survival. Most studies to date on
myopenia in CRC have been retrospective and have failed to comprehensively assess myopenia, thus limiting
our understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with increased adverse outcomes. Furthermore,
conventional chemotherapy dosing by body surface area (BSA) ignores the variability in body composition
demonstrated in adults with cancer. As myopenia frequently results in lower lean body mass (LBM) relative to
BSA, myopenic patients receive higher effective doses of chemotherapy relative to their LBM, likely resulting in
increased chemotoxicity. Prospective evaluation of myopenia in older adults with CRC is critically needed to
better understand the association of myopenia with adverse outcomes and to develop precise and personalized
interventions to improve outcomes. The central goal of our prospective longitudinal study is to better understand
myopenia and its association with chemotherapy toxicity and overall survival in older adults with metastatic CRC.
We will leverage the routine clinical use of Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to assess muscle mass at
baseline and evaluate trajectories over time during treatment with chemotherapy. In addition, we will explore
genetic variation in telomere homeostasis, DNA damage response/repair (DDR), inflammation, and myostatin
as well as altered pharmacokinetics (PKs) of oxaliplatin (in a subset of patients) to explore their mediation of
the association between myopenia and grades 3-5 chemotoxicity. This study will further promote my long-term
goal of optimizing the treatment of older adults with cancer and provide additional training in clinical trial design,
advanced quantitative analysis, body composition methods, PK measurement/interpretation, and molecular
epidemiology. My results will inform future studies including the development of chemotoxicity prediction tools
specific to older adults with CRC, interventional trials combating myopenia, and the potential development of
alternative dosing strategies in myopenic patients that incorporate LBM to augment chemotherapy dosing in
order avoid unnecessary toxicities while maintaining and/or improving efficacy. My proposed research
experience coupled with my career development plan and mentorship will provide the necessary catalyst for me
to develop an independent research career focused on improving the outcomes of older adults with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Colorectal Cancer (CRC) - a disease predominately of older adults - is challenging to treat in older
patients due to an increased risk and high inter-individual variability in severe chemotherapy-related toxicities
(chemotoxicity). Myopenia, loss of muscle mass, is associated with increased chemotoxicity and inferior survival
in adults with CRC, yet the underlying mechanisms of myopenia-related chemotoxicity remains uncertain. Our
prospective study is focused on examining the trajectories of myopenia, its association with chemotoxicity and
survival, and the role of altered pharmacokinetics and genetic variants as underlying mechanisms of increased
chemotoxicities in older adults with metastatic CRC in order to better understand the variability in treatment
outcomes and ultimately target interventions to improve them.",2019,206920,191593,15327,Other Research-Related,K08,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Aging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Patient Safety; Precision Medicine,Grant R Williams
5F31NS106820-02,Role of T cells in an Alpha-Synuclein Mediated Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease,"Project Summary
 This proposal aims to determine the contribution of T cells to pathology in an alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn)
based mouse model of Parkinson disease (PD). Our lab has pursued the idea that Î±-syn, an intracellular
protein abnormally aggregated in PD brains, is a trigger for the innate immune and adaptive immune system
activation associated with PD. Targeted overexpression of Î±-syn in the substantia nigra of mice driven by an
adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2-SYN) recapitulates the microgliosis, T cell infiltration, and slow
progressive cell death observed in human PD. Additionally, knocking out antigen processing machinery
(MHCII) reduces Î±-syn induced inflammation and neurodegeneration, suggesting a possible T cell mediated
disease mechanism. The proposed research attempts to build upon these findings, by investigating the
hypothesis that activation of T cells is required for mediating the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein
in vivo.
 First, proposed experiments will determine whether alpha synuclein can lead to T cell activation in an
AAV2-SYN mouse model of PD. Changes in brain effector T cell populations will be measured through IHC
and flow cytometry in BL6 mice injected with AAV2-SYN or a control AAV2 vector (AAV2-GFP) at 2, 4, and 12
weeks post-injection. Next, experiments to determine the effect of T cells on myeloid activation in response to
Î±-syn will be conducted. Changes in activated myeloid populations will be measured in AAV2-SYN treated BL6
and mice lacking CD4 T cells (either by genetic KO or pharmacological treatment) by IHC and flow cytometry
2, 4, and 12 weeks post injection.
 Lastly, the hypothesis that blocking T cells (either by genetic KO or pharmacological treatment) into the
CNS will reduce the neurodegeneration associated with Î±-syn overexpression will be tested. Both control BL6
mice and mice with a deficiency in CD4 T cells will be injected with AAV2-GFP and AAV2-SYN in the
substantia nigra. Dopaminergic neuron loss will be assessed at 6 months post-injection with unbiased
stereology. Collectively, the completion of these experiments will aid in the development of new therapeutics
targeting T cells that work to prevent neuroinflammation as a neuroprotective treatment for Parkinson disease.
 The proposed training plan is sponsored by Dr. David Standaert and Dr. Ashley Harms. The overall
goal of the training plan is to provide the PI with a solid foundation for a successful career as a research
scientist studying neuroimmunology. Included in the training plan are experiences that help the PI: 1) gain
competence in a variety of techniques integrating neurobiology and immunology, 2) collaborate with other
scientists, 3) develop hypothesis-driven research, 4) present data in a written and oral format, 5) effectively
integrate research with clinic, and 6) responsibly conduct research.","Project Narrative

5K01HD079582-05,Diet composition and cardiometabolic risk reduction in adults with SCI,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of lifestyle interventions for prevention and reduction of cardiometabolic
risk factors (CMRF) in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this application is to augment my previous training in obesity, behavioral science and research design with additional tools necessary to make this transition.  As a behavioral scientist, my research and clinical practice focus on lifestyle interventions for obesity. After completion of my doctorate in Health Education and Promotion, I completed a competitive T-32 fellowship in Comparative Effectiveness Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), with special focus on tailoring lifestyle interventions for specific populations. This training furthered my understanding of adapting interventions for specific needs of special populations and measuring the effectiveness of these interventions using randomized controlled trials and real world clinical
trials. Throughout my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I also received clinical training in the
UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences. In this clinical role, I learned nutritional and physical activity considerations for treating obesity in a variety of chronic diseases, as well as how to incorporate behavior change strategies to improve adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations. I also had the opportunity to work with individuals with a variety of physical disabilities including SCI. It was during this clinical training that I began to understand the barriers individuals with physical disabilities face in developing healthy dietary and activity routines, and the lack of evidenced-based recommendations for reducing obesity and other CMRF in this population.  To further my training, this career development award (CDA) will focus on three goals. First, I will increase my understanding of the unique disease processes associated with SCI that influence cardiometabolic risk factors after injury. Second, I will augment my current knowledge of psychosocial determinants of obesity with an increased understanding of the unique determinants of behavior change in adults with SCI. Third, I aim to increase my understanding of how to leverage emerging technology to develop novel interventions that can directly address barriers to adherence among adults with SCI. Completion of these training goals, along with the proposed study will put me in a position to apply for R01 level funding by the end of the CDA period.  Despite significant evidence on CMRF and obesity among adults with SCI, there is little evidence on the best methods for addressing these significant health issues. Lifestyle interventions consisting of diet and exercise recommendations along with behavioral strategies to increase adherence to these recommendations, are considered the first line of treatment for weight loss and reduction of CMRF, but little research has explored how to adapt these interventions for adults with SCI. Specifically, dietary adherence continues to be an obstacle to long term weight maintenance, and this may be compounded in adults with SCI given the metabolic, psychosocial and environmental barriers associated with this disability. Reduced carbohydrate (CHO) diets have been found to improve CMRF in non-SCI groups. They have also been associated with decreased hunger and cravings, and improved mood and energy levels, all of which may lead to improved dietary adherence. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess differences in dietary adherence, body composition and insulin, glucose, lipids and hs-CRP between a reduced CHO and standard diet in obese adults with SCI. This study will employ a novel home-based telehealth intervention utilizing an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform designed specifically for individuals with SCI.  I have developed an excellent mentoring team to guide this CDA. James Rimmer, PhD, will serve as primary mentor. Dr. Rimmer is internationally known for his work in exercise, health promotion and physical disabilities and currently serves as the inaugural UAB/Lakeshore Foundation Endowed Chair in Health Promotion and Rehabilitation Science. Barbara Gower, PhD will serve as co-mentor and will oversee my training in CMRF including trainings in measuring and interpreting body composition, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These mentors, along with consultants Kathleen Martin Ginis, PhD, Leslie McClure, PhD, and Yu-ying Chen, MD, PhD, will guide me through the proposed training program and ensure completion of the proposed study.  The resources afforded to me by my mentoring team and UAB are excellent. I will be involved in research and training in the UAB Departments of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, as well as the PhD program in Rehabilitation Science. Additionally, I will work closely with the UAB/Lakeshore Research Collaborative, which serves as a partnership between leading UAB researchers and state-of-the-art fitness and health promotion programs for people with physical disabilities.  In conclusion, my research and clinical experience make me an excellent candidate for the K01 Mentored Career Development Award in Medical Rehabilitation Research. I believe that the completion of the proposed training plan and study, in conjunction with guidance from an outstanding mentor team and the resources afforded to me by UAB offer an excellent opportunity to complete my transition to independent investigator.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiometabolic diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes are among the leading causes of illness and death in adults living with spinal cord injury. These diseases can be reduced by following a healthy diet, but many people have trouble adhering to a healthy diet long term. Research in non-injured adults has shown that reduced carbohydrate diets may reduce these diseases and lead to increased dietary adherence over low fat diets; however no research has examined this in individuals with SCI.

5K08DK115833-02,Obesity and Endogenous Oxalate Synthesis,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal will enable advancement of my research career under the guidance, experience, and tutelage of
successful and effective mentors. In addition, my research knowledge will be augmented by training in human
studies, animal work and the complex metabolic analytical skills. This proposal will give me the tools necessary
to become an independent investigator. Finally, the proposed study provides me the opportunity to continue
my current research endeavors, specifically looking at kidney stone disease, endogenous oxalate synthesis,
and the role of obesity.
The prevalence of kidney stone disease linearly increased in the U.S. over the last several decades, now
afflicting 10-15% of the population. The etiology of kidney stone disease is multifactorial involving lifestyle
factors, genetics, diet, and environment. Multiple medical comorbidities have been linked to kidney stone
disease including obesity. One component of the most common type of stone composition is oxalate, an end
product of metabolism. Small increases in urinary oxalate can increase calcium oxalate crystal formation and
thus stone disease. Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between obesity
and urinary oxalate excretion. Yet, little is known about the underlying reason for this increase in urinary
oxalate.
Urinary oxalate levels are affected by both a dietary and endogenous component and each is felt to contribute
equally. Endogenous oxalate synthesis has been previously thought to occur primarily in the liver and its major
source is glyoxylate. The biochemical pathways involved in oxalate production are poorly understood despite
extensive research. The central hypothesis is that the increase in urinary oxalate seen in obesity is derived
from increased endogenous production. Further, it is proposed that obesity influences the metabolic processes
within the liver, resulting in increased oxalate synthesis. The hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: 1) Evaluating oxalate synthesis in a lean and a diet-induced obese animal model, 2) To demonstrate that
obese humans have increased endogenous oxalate synthesis on controlled diets. I will apply our laboratories
expertise in controlled dietary studies in both humans and mice, and utilize complex analytical technologies,
including mass spectrometry based assays.
The proposed study may provide new insights regarding the role of obesity and fat distribution on endogenous
oxalate production and thus calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. It will facilitate my transition into an
independent and productive NIH funded investigator.","Project Narrative
The goal of this proposal is to determine the contribution and significance of obesity to urinary oxalate
excretion and thus calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. Successful completion of the study will provide
insight into the link between obesity and kidney stone disease and should identify future strategies to treat this
disease.",2019,166752,154400,12352,Other Research-Related,K08,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Obesity; Urologic Diseases,Kyle D Wood
5P30DK072482-13,Core A: Cell Model and Evaluation Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: P30 CORE A
Well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells and the assays that can be used with them are an
instrumental model for understanding epithelial biology and are highly predictive of in vivo results in clinical
trials. Primary cells can be used with methodologies that translate readily to assays of airway function in vivo,
including measures of CFTR activity or other ion transporters, airway surface liquid depth and mucus
hydration, and mucus viscosity and transport. Primary airway cells further provide an excellent model for
examining the biology of airway epithelial inflammation, which is key to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF)
lung disease. The purpose of Core A is to support the research of numerous P30 investigators that involves
cell culture systems and to assist with established and innovative assays available to characterize cellular
responses.
Core A carries out three main functions as outlined in the Specific Aims. First, Core A procures, grows, and
distributes well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells from CF and non-CF donors. This includes
samples of cells from lung transplants, surgically excised nasal tissue, and nasal brushings obtained at UAB
and from a large array of collaborating centers. Examination of novel expansion and differentiation techniques
for primary cells is also a key function of the Core. Second, Core A conducts functional anatomic imaging of
airway epithelia by 1-micron resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (Î¼OCT) in vitro (primary cells of human
or non-human origin) and ex vivo (intact full-thickness trachea or mainstem bronchi of human origin or
comparable tissues from CF animal models, thus interfacing with Core B). Î¼OCT allows for investigators to
explore mucus flow and mucociliary interactions and is designated as a National Core due to its unique and
important capabilities. Third, Core A performs and assists with measures of CFTR activity and expression. In
addition to traditional assays of CFTR function (e.g, Ussing chambers), the Core supports innovative
conductance assays and advanced PCR technology for investigating CFTR and other protein expression.
Core A facilitates interdisciplinary collaborative research, provides resources that are beyond the expertise of
individual research laboratories, fosters the sharing of ideas and experimental strategies, assists with technical
troubleshooting, and maintains essential equipment that is and will be heavily utilized by P30 personnel and
beyond. Cost savings are achieved by minimizing duplicate efforts of individual CF investigators, by the
centralized purchase and usage of equipment, reagents, and supplies, as well as by maintaining a central
repository for human epithelial tissue. On the whole, Core A provides significant expertise and resources to
aid P30 investigators, fostering advancement of epithelial cell culture and innovative assays to understand
CFTR pathogenesis and support rational drug discovery.",,2019,241719,162774,78945,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Rare Diseases,Bradford Alan Woodworth
5R01HL133006-04,Ivacaftor for Acquired CFTR Dysfunction in Chronic Rhinosinusitis,"Ineffective mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a common pathophysiologic process contributing to chronic
rhinosinusitis (CRS) - a highly prevalent disease with substantial morbidity. Evidence from our laboratory has
demonstrated that brief exposures to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria lead to
dysfunctional MCC by decreasing anion transport through CFTR apical Cl- channels in humans and other
mammalian species. CFTR inhibition in this setting is caused by TLR4-mediated generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), but independent of NFkB-derived inflammation. Furthermore, our group has confirmed the
presence of acquired CFTR dysfunction in human sinuses, and has demonstrated that CFTR potentiators can
stimulate Cl- secretion when partial CFTR dysfunction is present in multiple in vitro and preclinical models. Our
central hypotheses are that LPS-induced acquired CFTR deficiency, 1) contributes substantially to the
pathogenesis of CRS, and 2) can be treated with Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator developed for CF
therapy. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the mechanistic basis of LPS-mediated CFTR dysfunction in sinonasal
epithelium by 1) examining the oxidant-dependent inhibition of CFTR via AMP-dependent kinase (an inhibitor
of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the CFTR regulatory domain), 2) assessing the impact of ROS
(superoxide, hydrogen peroxide) on CFTR function (patch clamp analysis) and structure (mass spectrometry),
and 3) measuring the effects of longer exposures to LPS on CFTR expression, maturational processing, and
recycling. Aim 2 will identify the efficiency of Ivacaftor in improving CFTR function in a pre-clinical rabbit model
of acquired CFTR deficiency by 1) developing normative data for LPS-exposed rabbit maxillary sinus CFTR
dysfunction, 2) assessing the effects of Ivacaftor on CFTR-related endpoints, and 3) evaluating Ivacaftor as
therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa rabbit maxillary sinusitis. Aim 3 will conduct a clinical study using
Ivacaftor in CRS patients by 1) correlating the novel â€œendoscopically-directed sinus potential differenceâ€ assay
to validated measures of CRS disease severity and 2) performing a pilot clinical trial using Ivacaftor for CRS
patients with refractory gram-negative bacterial CRS. The current proposal will help clarify mechanisms
responsible for sinusitis pathogenesis, but also translates our laboratory findings to human subjects by
providing a clinical trial using Ivacaftor for therapy of sinusitis. We believe our application will answer
fundamental questions regarding pathomechanisms underlying CRS and establish the foundation for a new
therapeutic approach to a serious and debilitating chronic disease.","Evidence from our laboratory has demonstrated that brief exposures to lipopolysaccharide â€“ a
component of gram-negative bacterial cell walls - lead to dysfunctional mucus clearance by decreasing
transport of chloride (Cl-) ions through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)

CFTR dysfunction in the sinuses of human subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis, and that the drug
Ivacaftor (developed for therapy of cystic fibrosis) overcomes acquired Cl- secretory defects present in
multiple in vitro and in vivo model systems. The current proposal will help clarify mechanisms

5K01AR068400-03,Biology or Management: Understanding Racial Differences in Post Fracture Outcomes,"ABSTRACT
Fragility fractures related to osteoporosis are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Up to a third
of patients die in the year after sustaining a hip fracture, 20% require extended time nursing facilities, and one
in ten require additional financial assistance from Medicaid post fracture. Preliminary data among Medicare
beneficiaries indicate that there are significant racial differences in hip fracture mortality; specifically, a higher
mortality rate among Black women, suggesting either biological differences in bone health, disparities in
osteoporosis and post fracture management, or both. A current evaluation of racial differences in post fracture
outcomes has not been performed. Similarly, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of factors that if
intervened upon, could reduce the disparity in these post-fracture outcomes. Many factors that prevent and/or
reduce the adverse sequelae of fractures have been reported from large national osteoporosis cohorts.
However, these cohorts had a relatively small proportion of Blacks, and these factors may have different
associations in the Black population. Currently, Blacks comprise the largest racial minority group in the United
States, thus highlighting the need to evaluate factors potentially mediating these disparities and designing
studies targeting these factors to reducing the mortality disparity in the Black population. To further my journey
as an independent osteoporosis outcomes and disparities researcher, I propose a project titled â€œBiology or
Management: Understanding Racial Differences in Post-Fracture Outcomes.â€ The specific aims for this study
are: 1) To determine current racial differences in post fracture outcomes, 2) To identify the patient,
health care utilization, and hospital-related factors that mediate the association between race and post-
fracture outcomes, and 3) To examine if psychosocial, cultural, and lifestyle factors mediate the
association between race and mobility among patients with hip fracture. To achieve these aims, I have
proposed training and career development activities around health disparities research, mediation analysis,
and pragmatic clinical trial design and intervention development with complementary osteoporosis and hip
fracture clinical rotations. With completion of my training activities and research aims, I will successfully
transition into an independent researcher, and be one step closer to my overall goal of reducing the racial
disparity in fracture outcomes.","NARRATIVE
It has been reported that Black women have a higher post-hip fracture outcomes, such as mortality, than White
women. The goal of this K01 project is to acquire the necessary training to: 1) describe the current post-
fracture mortality disparity between Black and White women, and 2) uncover the factors potentially causing the
disparity. Potential factors of interest include health-related factors, such as health conditions and health care
use, and social factors that must be directly measured from patients. With completion of this project I will not
only advance my independent research career but also provide evidence to the field to address key public
health questions of relevance to bone health and racial disparities.",2019,127062,117650,9412,Other Research-Related,K01,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,352940001,Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Osteoporosis; Prevention,Nicole C Wright
5R01DE022350-07,SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF CARIOGENIC BIOFILMS,"Abstract
 Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent infectious disease afflicting American Public. Biofilm
formation is crucial for the development of dental caries induced by cariogenic bacteria. Streptococcus mutans
is a model cariogenic bacterium that has adapted to the biofilm lifestyle. Bacteria within a biofilm are extremely
resistant to traditional antibiotics and host defense; therefore development of new classes of anti-biofilm reagents
that interfere with the biofilm formation and development by cariogenic bacteria is necessary and critical for the
treatment and prevention of dental caries. The most potent and versatile class of molecules with anti-biofilm
properties are those derived from the 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) scaffold discovered by the Melander group from
natural marine products. The 2-AI derivative is capable of inhibiting and dispersing diverse biofilms formed by
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In the last funding cycle, we have made great progress, and
identified and characterized two distinct 2-AI derivatives that either inhibit or disperse S. mutans cariogenic
biofilms specifically. The lead compounds do not affect biofilm formation by commensal oral streptococci. Our
studies have shown that one 2-AI derivative selectively targets a response regulator that modulates S. mutans
biofilm, fitness and virulence. The compound inhibits biofilm formation in vitro and bacterial virulence in vivo in
the complex microbial community, indicating it has great therapeutic potential. Another derivative we identified
selectively disperses preformed S. mutans biofilms in vitro and inhibits bacterial colonization and virulence in
vivo. The dispersion activity is not mediated by any known biofilm pathway, suggesting a novel underlying
mechanism. The goal of our current proposal is to further explore these two new classes of small molecules,
define their modes of action and develop more potent, selective chemical probes to dissect small molecules-
directed gene regulation and signaling that are key to biofilm development. Two specific aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: Explore molecular mechanisms of selective targeting of the response regulator of cariogenic
bacteria by the 2-AI derivative and use both structure-activity relationship studies, and structure-based drug
discovery schemes to enlighten the design and the development of more potent and selective chemical probes
to enhance anti-cariogenic activity. Specific Aim 2: Identify molecular targets of the potent small molecule that
disperses cariogenic S. mutans biofilms and determine the underlying mechanism of the biofilm dispersion. An
interdisciplinary team among microbiologists, medicinal chemists, structural biologists, animal model experts,
and dentist scientists will continue their productive collaborations, which should unravel molecular mechanisms
how lead compounds selectively inhibit and disperse cariogenic biofilms and facilitate the development of new
anti-caries strategies. The application will have a direct impact on the oral health of the general public since the
lead compounds have great therapeutic potentials in preventing or treating dental caries.","NARRATIVE

5R01DE017954-12,GLYCOSYLATION AND BIOGENESIS OF STREPTOCOCCAL ADHESINS,"Essential to oral biofilm development is the initial colonization by oral streptococci. The abundant oral
streptococci keep pathogens at bay. We have used the most abundant oral streptococcus, Streptococcus
parasanguinis as a model to study bacterial colonization and identified a new family of bacterial serine-rich
repeat proteins (SRRPs) named â€œfimbriae-associated protein-1â€ (Fap1). Fap1 is heavily glycosylated, and
glycosylation of Fap1 is crucial for bacterial biofilm formation. Since our discovery of Fap1, Fap1-like SRRPs
have been identified from numerous Gram-positive bacteria and implicated in bacterial fitness and virulence.
Our studies have led to the groundbreaking discovery of a new Fap1 biosynthetic pathway. We have
demonstrated that the Fap1 biogenesis is controlled by a gene cluster encoding a series of novel
glycosyltransferases and unique accessory secretion proteins. Biogenesis of SRRPs has now emerged as a
new paradigm to investigate bacterial protein glycosylation and secretion. During our study of Fap1
glycosylation, we have defined a complete glycosylation pathway that synthesizes a novel Fap1 glycan. In the
study of Fap1 secretion, we have identified a protein complex consisting of three distinct glycosylation
associated proteins Gap1, 2 and 3 that work in concert to modulate the Fap1 maturation and biogenesis.
Further, we have determined the high resolution 3-dimensional structure of the Gap1/2/3 complex, which
uncovered new mechanistic insights for this 3-protein complex. Gap1 and Gap2 exhibit dual functions in the
biogenesis of Fap1. 1), Gap1 and Gap2 modulates the formation of the protein complex as a molecular
chaperone. 2), Gap1 and Gap2 function as a glucosyltransferase and glucosidase respectively in the quality
control of Fap1 maturation and biogenesis. The Gap protein complex resembles the three-key elements in the
eukaryotic quality control system dedicated to glycosylated proteins, hence we will continue our basic science
discovery of new biology and biochemistry linked to maturation and biogenesis of Fap1 & other SRRPs.
Aim 1 Determine how Gap1 functions as a molecular chaperone for Gap2 and as a key quality control
glycosyltransferase to process Fap1 precursor during Fap1 biogenesis. We will use genetic, biochemical,
structural biology, and glycobiology approaches to investigate how Gap1 stabilizes Gap2 as a molecular
chaperone, and how Gap1 acts as a quality control glycosyltransferase to process Fap1 precursor.
Aim 2 Define the roles played by Gap2 as a molecular chaperone for Gap3 and as a key quality control
glucosidase during Fap1 biogenesis. We will determine how Gap2 assists Gap3 as an accessory
chaperone, and coordinates with Gap1 and Gap3 to process Fap1, thus modulating the Fap1 biogenesis.
As biogenesis of SRRPs is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria, deciphering novel molecular insight to
this new protein complex as a quality control system will offer new opportunities to develop new strategies to
maintain healthy oral cavity as well as to combat bacterial infections.","NARRATIVE

identified and shown to play vital roles in diverse bacterial cellular processes. C-di-AMP is essential in many
Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We and others
have found that c-di-AMP is not essential in Streptococcus mutans, an important etiological agent of dental caries
(cavity), but regulates cariogenic biofilm formation, bacterial stress responses, and dynamic polymicrobial
interactions that are crucial for S. mutans fitness and virulence. Little is known about the role of c-di-AMP
signaling pathways that modulate distinct and conserved virulent properties found in S. mutans and other
pathogens. In this proposal, we use S. mutans as a model to elucidate virulence regulation mediated by this
emerging signaling molecule. Inactivation of the gene coding for c-di-AMP producing enzyme reduced bacterial
colonization and virulence in a rat model of dental caries, demonstrating a critical role of c-di-AMP in S. mutans
virulence. Moreover, c-di-AMP-mediated virulence networks are integrated into a key response regulator VicR-
modulated signaling through a newly identified c-di-AMP binding receptor (CabPA). These novel findings led us
to hypothesize that c-di-AMP regulates biofilm formation and other virulence properties via multiple new
pathways, which represent major potential therapeutic targets to develop novel and selective anti-virulence
compounds. Two specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: 1) To elucidate c-di-AMP and its receptor
CabPA mediated signaling pathways that modulate the biofilm formation and other virulence properties; 2) To
develop new small molecule compounds that modulate S. mutans virulence by targeting the c-di-AMP producing
enzyme. The proposal would allow us to identify new signaling components and unknown dynamic interactions
in c-di-AMP-mediated pathways responsible for the biofilm formation, oxidative stress, and bacterial
competitiveness, and uncover potential therapeutic targets, which would facilitate the future development of new
small molecule compounds that are amenable for drug discovery. The proposal tests a new hypothesis that links
c-di-AMP signaling to VicR-mediated expression of a variety of virulence genes through a distinct c-di-AMP
receptor, and documents non-essential nature of c-di-AMP signaling in S. mutans, and explores the translational
potential using anti-virulence strategy. Successful completion of this application will have a direct impact on
public health as dental caries and other infectious conditions are widespread due to antibiotic resistance and
lack of effective treatment options. Development of anti-S. mutans virulence strategy in the proposal is also
relevant to devise species-specific anti-virulence strategy targeting significant pathogens such as S. aureus and
S. pneumoniae, which should open a new venue to the design of new anti-infectious agents to combat microbial
infection and antibiotic resistance.","NARRATIVE
An emerging bacterial second messenger c-di-AMP is not only conserved in cariogenic Streptococcus mutans
but also found in significant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Decoding mysterious networks that regulate various virulent phenotypes by this novel bacterial second
messenger would empower and enable us to develop novel strategies for potential therapeutics that can prevent
or treat bacterial infection beyond dental caries, and combat antibiotic resistance.",2019,341550,230000,111550,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN,352940001,Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome,Hui  Wu
3R01DE022350-07S1,SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF CARIOGENIC BIOFILMS,"Abstract
 Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent infectious disease afflicting American Public. Biofilm
formation is crucial for the development of dental caries induced by cariogenic bacteria. Streptococcus mutans
is a model cariogenic bacterium that has adapted to the biofilm lifestyle. Bacteria within a biofilm are extremely
resistant to traditional antibiotics and host defense; therefore development of new classes of anti-biofilm reagents
that interfere with the biofilm formation and development by cariogenic bacteria is necessary and critical for the
treatment and prevention of dental caries. The most potent and versatile class of molecules with anti-biofilm
properties are those derived from the 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) scaffold discovered by the Melander group from
natural marine products. The 2-AI derivative is capable of inhibiting and dispersing diverse biofilms formed by
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In the last funding cycle, we have made great progress, and
identified and characterized two distinct 2-AI derivatives that either inhibit or disperse S. mutans cariogenic
biofilms specifically. The lead compounds do not affect biofilm formation by commensal oral streptococci. Our
studies have shown that one 2-AI derivative selectively targets a response regulator that modulates S. mutans
biofilm, fitness and virulence. The compound inhibits biofilm formation in vitro and bacterial virulence in vivo in
the complex microbial community, indicating it has great therapeutic potential. Another derivative we identified
selectively disperses preformed S. mutans biofilms in vitro and inhibits bacterial colonization and virulence in
vivo. The dispersion activity is not mediated by any known biofilm pathway, suggesting a novel underlying
mechanism. The goal of our current proposal is to further explore these two new classes of small molecules,
define their modes of action and develop more potent, selective chemical probes to dissect small molecules-
directed gene regulation and signaling that are key to biofilm development. Two specific aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: Explore molecular mechanisms of selective targeting of the response regulator of cariogenic
bacteria by the 2-AI derivative and use both structure-activity relationship studies, and structure-based drug
discovery schemes to enlighten the design and the development of more potent and selective chemical probes
to enhance anti-cariogenic activity. Specific Aim 2: Identify molecular targets of the potent small molecule that
disperses cariogenic S. mutans biofilms and determine the underlying mechanism of the biofilm dispersion. An
interdisciplinary team among microbiologists, medicinal chemists, structural biologists, animal model experts,
and dentist scientists will continue their productive collaborations, which should unravel molecular mechanisms
how lead compounds selectively inhibit and disperse cariogenic biofilms and facilitate the development of new
anti-caries strategies. The application will have a direct impact on the oral health of the general public since the
lead compounds have great therapeutic potentials in preventing or treating dental caries.","NARRATIVE
Dental caries (also known as tooth decay or cavity) is the most prevalent infectious disease of mankind. Our

age-old treatment options.",2019,85769,57757,28012,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN,352940001,Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Prevention,Christian Corey Melander; Hui  Wu
1R25GM132967-01,Science Education Enabling Careers II (SEEC II),"For nearly 20 years, the UAB Center for Community OutReach Development (CORD) has conducted SEPA-
funded research that has greatly enhanced the number of minority students entering the pipeline to college
and biomedical careers, e.g., nearly all of CORDâ€™s Summer Research Interns since 1998 (>300) have
completed/are completing college and most of them are continuing on to graduate biomedical research and/or
clinical training and careers. CORDâ€™s programs that focused on high and middle school students have drawn
many minority students into biomedical careers, but a low percentage of minority students benefit from these
programs because far too many are already left behind academically in grades 4-6, due, at least in part, to a
significant drop in science grades between grades 4 and 6, a drop from which most students never recover. A
major contributor to this effect is that most grade 4-6 teachers in predominantly minority schools lack significant
formal training in science and often are not fully aware of the great opportunities offered by biomedical careers.
In SEEC II, CORD will deliver intensive inquiry-based science training to grade 4-6 teachers, providing them
with science content and hands-on science experiences that will afford their student both content and skills
that will make them excited about, and competitive for, the advanced courses needed to move into biomedical
research careers. SEEC II will also link teachers together across the elementary/middle school divide and bring
the teachers together with administrators and parents, who will experience firsthand the excitement that inquiry
learning brings and the significant advancement it provides in science and in reading and math. At monthly
meetings and large annual celebrations, the parents, teachers and administrators will learn about the
opportunities that biomedical careers can provide for the student who is well prepared. They will also consider
the financial and educational steps required to ensure that students have the ability to reach these professions.
SEEC II will also expand CORDâ€™s middle school LabWorks and Summer Science Camps to include grade 4-5
students and provide the teachers with professional learning in informal settings. During summer training, in
small groups, the teachers will expand one of the inquiry-based science activities that they complete in the
training, and they will use these in their classrooms and communicate with the others in their group to perfect
these experiences in the school year. Finally, the teachers and grade 4-5 students will develop science and
engineering fair-type research projects with which they will compete both on the school level and at the annual
meeting. Thus, the students will share with their parents the excitement that science brings. The Intellectual
Merit of SEEC II will be to test a model to enhance grade 4-6 teacher development and vertical alignment,
providing science content, exposure to biomedical scientists and training in participatory science experiments,
thus positioning teachers to succeed. The Broader Impacts will include the translation and testing of a science
education model to assist minority students to avoid the middle school plunge and reach biomedical careers.","SEEC II will greatly advance the science education for urban minority grade 4-6 students
through a rigorous science teacher development program that will provide teachers with
new insights into inquiry based activities by which their students will engage in active
learning and assessment methods that will allow the teacher to quickly evaluate where
each of their students are in mastering the science content and skills of an activity. By
implementing this program, teachers will make their students more aware of the
opportunities that science and specifically biomedical research careers hold for them,
and ensure when they are ready to decide on a career, that they are not left behind due
to lacking prerequisite science knowledge and skills. The Intellectual Merit of this project
will be to enhance teacher development by providing up-to-date knowledge of science
content, exposure to biomedical scientists and training in participatory science
experiments, thus enabling them to excite students and position them for competitive
biomedical careers, and the broader impacts will include the translation and testing of a

2R25GM111369-06,Blazing to Biomedical Careers II (BBC II),"Over the past 4 years, Lawson State and Jefferson State Community Colleges (LSCC, JSCC)
and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) joined together to develop a dynamic
program bridging community college students into biomedical education at 4-year institutions and
then on to biomedical and behavioral graduate programs and careers. Bridges to Biomedical
Careers (BBC) proposed that 80% of its students would enter into a 4-year college program in
biomedical and behavioral sciences, 75% would gain a BS, 35% would enter biomedical graduate
education and 35% would enter biomedical careers. Joint STEM education collaborations among
the 3 schools, aggressive recruitment and close faculty and peer mentoring were important in
BBCâ€™s success. 59 students have entered BBC, 86% have completed an AS in a biomedical-
related field, 100% are graduates or still in BBC, 100% are underrepresented minorities, and 5
are in biomedical graduate programs. BBC II will enhance this success further by closer
interactions among the 3 colleges in research and education and increased faculty, peer
mentoring, and new collaborative biomedical courses on the 3 campuses. An additional 5 years
of student tracking will allow us to identify of BBC/BBCII elements that predict which students will
gain most from various aspects of BBC/BBC II. Biomedical research is expanding rapidly in the
US; however, minorities continue to be underrepresented in this workforce. Minorities constitute
~29% of the US population, but hold only ~7% of PhD degrees and only ~4% of RO1 grants in
biomedical and behavioral science. Many minority students lack early engagement and
opportunities to develop skills and content knowledge to complete BS programs. BBCII will
provide students at community colleges with educational opportunities, internships and mentoring
that will introduce them biomedical and behavioral research and prepare them for rigorous
advanced coursework at UAB. The students will be paid for their summer research internships
and for research/mentoring opportunities during the school year. Students will be encouraged to
be peer mentors to newer BBC II students, thus facilitating a successful transition to UAB and
beyond. Top performing interns will be recruited to return to their community college to talk to
students about their research and how to become a biomedical researcher. The Broader Impact
of BBC II will be to create a new cadre of minority individuals in biomedical and behavioral
research. The Intellectual Merit will be to identify methods that engage and prepare
underrepresented students for careers in biomedical and behavioral research. The two
community colleges are different, and thus BBC II will identify best methods for diverse students.","Blazing to Biomedical Careers II (BBC II) will continue to greatly facilitate the transition of
community college students into biomedical and behavioral education at the undergraduate and
graduate university level and advance these students into careers in biomedical and behavioral
sciences, some as research leaders and others as major support staff. BBC II will focus on
underrepresented individuals in these fields, especially on African-American, Hispanic and rural
underserved students and will provide paid research internships for the students before each
year of community college education that will help them to master the science content and skills
that they will need in their college preparation. It will also provide excellent faculty and peer
mentoring that will assist them in bridging successfully to and through the 4-year institution and
will build on our success in BBC, enhancing the student pipeline to biomedical and behavioral

5P30NS047466-14,Core A: Behavioral Assessment Core,"The Behavioral Assessment Core (Core A) provides both service-oriented behavioral phenotyping and
research staff training to investigators using rodents. One of the major goals of the Core is and will be the
development and operation of a consolidated facility in which mice and rats can reliably and consistently be
tested using the most-accepted battery of behavioral tests. These tests rank from the basic SHIRPA battery,
to tests for cognition (including Morris water maze, Barnes maze, holeboard maze and eight-arm radial maze
tasks). Behavioral testing will either be carried out by the staff of the Core, or the Technical Director will train
personnel from the investigator's lab to conduct more extensive studies. He will assist in the design of new
protocols for the PI, either using the equipment of the BAC, or by acquiring new equipment. The Core will
provide similar assessments for both mouse and rat behavior in apparatuses designed for each species. The
Core will also assist investigators in the development of tools that are needed by them for a more detailed
assessment of specific behaviors. The development of new equipment is done together with companies that
are interested in developing new tests. Currently, most of the existing tasks are automated, thereby greatly
decreasing any potential investigator bias to the results. In collaboration with Animal Resources Program, we
are providing behavioral testing facilities for zebrafish, using the tracking software package developed by the

5R03HL141620-02,Beta-hydroxybutyrate Protects Mitochondria During Cardiac Ischemia Reperfusion Injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY: There are approximately 1.5 million new acute myocardial infarction (MI) cases in the
USA yearly. Approximately half of cell death is due to reperfusion injury during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), for
which there is no standard therapy. Designing novel therapies for reperfusion injury is therefore of major
clinical importance. Interestingly, the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (ï¢-OHB), whose level is increased in
DM, is an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. We recently showed that an FDA-approved
HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, reduces infarct size by 40% when given at the time of reperfusion via the activation of
autophagy. Similarly, acutely increased ï¢-OHB by IP injection or fasting before I/R reduces infarct size after
cardiac I/R in rats. These studies suggest that ï¢-OHB has robust cardioprotective effects. However, how ï¢-
OHB protects myocardium during I/R is not clear. Whether given ï¢-OHB at the time of reperfusion still protects
reperfusion injury is also unknown. Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that: 1) in ST elevation MI
(STEMI) patients, ï¢-OHB levels are elevated in the acute phase; 2) ï¢-OHB is a HDAC inhibitor in immortalized
human cardiomyocyte, AC16 cells; 3) SAHA, an HDAC inhibitor, protects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level,
membrane potential, and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) during I/R. As an HDAC inhibitor, whether ï¢-
OHB protects mitochondrial function similar as SAHA is unknown. If ï¢-OHB, an endogenous metabolite,
protects the mitochondria, we will be able to decode the endogenous protective mechanisms and devise new
therapies for cardioprotection during I/R.
Hypothesis: ï¢-OHB attenuates I/R induced mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction when given at the time
of reperfusion, through HDAC inhibition and autophagy.
Specific Aims:
1. Determine whether ï¢-OHB protects mitochondrial structure and function in cardiomyocytes
during I/R through autophagy.
2. Determine whether ï¢-OHB reduces infarct size and preserves cardiac function through
autophagy and mitochondria protection in a mouse I/R model when given at the time of reperfusion.
3. Determine whether ï¢-OHB level is elevated in STEMI patients and whether ï¢-OHB protects
mitochondrial structure and function in human nucleated cells in blood.
Significance: After finishing the study, we will determine whether ï¢-OHB, a nature metabolite and an
endogenous HDAC inhibitor, reduces infarct size at the time of reperfusion and if it is through protecting
mitochondrial function by autophagy. This will enable us to develop novel therapies for reperfusion injury.

5K08HL127305-06,Autophagy-dependent cardioprotection in ischemia/reperfusion injury,"ï»¿   
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid restoration of blood flow to the ischemic heart is vital in acute coronary syndromes. However, reperfusion also contributes significantly to myocardial infarct size(1). Currently, there are no clinical therapies targeting reperfusion injury Elucidation of mechanisms of reperfusion injury -- with an eye toward clinical translation -- is urgently needed. Inhibition of class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically at the time of reperfusion, confers cardioprotection in multiple animal models of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury(2, 3). Autophagy is critical in the response to I/R injury(3). We have demonstrated that HDAC inhibition promotes cardiomyocyte autophagy, which is critical to the robust cardioprotective effects we observe(3). Also, appropriate mitochondrial quality control is critical
to cardioprotection during I/R(4, 5). Here, we will define mechanisms whereby cardiomyocyte autophagy protects against I/R injury. We propose to manipulate autophagy using two strategies: a) HDAC inhibition, and b) a cell-permeable peptide (Tat-Beclin), a strong autophagy activator(6). The former approach is imminently translatable to the clinical context. The latter approach allows us to isolate specifically the contribution of activated autophagy, parsing it from
other effects of HDAC inhibition. Also, we will define mechanisms whereby activated autophagy is protective, focusing on excessive ROS production by defective mitochondria escaping autophagic elimination.  We hypothesize that Tat-Beclin treatment will promote autophagy and confer cardioprotection to reperfusion-injured myocardium. We also hypothesize that induction of autophagy either with HDAC inhibition or Tat-Beclin will lead to a decrease in ROS production during reperfusion in the border zone resulting in increased cardiomyocyte survival. Aim 1: Determine whether Tat-Beclin induces autophagy and whether it is cardioprotective in I/R- stressed cardiomyocytes in vitro. Aim 2: Determine whether Tat-Beclin is cardioprotective in an in vivo cardiac I/R injury model and whether autophagy is essential for the cardioprotection. Aim 3: Determine whether therapeutically up-regulated cardiomyocyte autophagy preserves mitochondrial function and reduces ROS production.  This proposal is timely, mechanistic, novel, and holds great potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in ischemic heart disease. Tat-Beclin, a selective autophagy inducer, is a powerful way to extend our understanding of autophagy-dependent cardioprotection in I/R injury. Further, we will explore cardioprotective reperfusion targets in the autophagic pathway, such as ROS regulation. As Tat-Beclin is a potential therapeutic agent, this is a uniquely translational strategy with potential for clinical impact. Finally, this research serves as a critical platform for me to complete my training as a physician-scientist.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies proposed here will test whether a novel therapeutic agent, Tat-Beclin, which induces autophagy (a protective cellular process) reduces heart attack size in mouse, and define underlying molecular mechanisms. These studies may lead to novel therapies that can further reduce heart attack size. These studies may also lead to a first-in-human clinical trial testing these novel therapies.",2019,167886,155450,12436,Other Research-Related,K08,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease,Min  Xie
5R01AR072213-02,Mechanism of ultraviolet radiation induced immune tolerance,"In humans, as in mice, chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation B (UVB, 290-320 nm) impairs host
immune responses in addition to inducing mutant cells. Tumors will occur only when there are mutant cells
in an immune suppressive environment. In fact, organ transplant recipients who are treated with
immunosuppressive medications have a greatly increased risk (up to 100 times) of skin cancers and the
tumors that do develop behave more aggressively. It has been known that UVB induced DNA damage is a
trigger for immune tolerance. Cell senescence is a protective mechanism to prevent transformation and growth
of cells with DNA damage. Senescent cells can produce many inflammatory mediators, a phenomenon called
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP recruits and activates immune cells to
eliminate DNA damaged cells, which is a critical mechanism of immune surveillance. However, SASP also has
roles in immunosuppression and tumor promotion. It is known that UVB induces cell senescence and SASP.
However, it is not known whether SASP is a mechanism for UVB induced tolerance. Our studies show that
depletion of senescent cells diminishes UVB induced SASP and inhibits tolerance. The result reveals a
previously unrecognized mechanism for UVB induced tolerance. Further, we have found that CD11b+/PD-L1+
cells are significantly increased by UVB whereas they are reduced by depletion of senescent cells. Importantly,
treatment with anti-PD-L1 antibodies inhibits UVB induced tolerance. To our best knowledge, this is the first
evidence that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor has a role in UVB induced tolerance. Our hypothesis is that
UVB induced cell senescence and SASP are a novel mechanism for UVB induced tolerogenic antigen
presenting cells (APC), Treg cells, and immune tolerance. Aim 1 will examine mechanisms by which depletion
of senescent cells inhibits UVB induced tolerance and immune suppressive environments in skin. We will
examine whether depletion of senescent cells inhibits Treg cells and enhances effector T cells. Further studies
will determine whether SASP mediated recruitment and stimulation of myeloid cells is a mechanism for UVB
induced tolerogenic APC and tolerance. We will also examine whether UVB induced SASP is associated with
tolerance in humans. Aim 2 will determine a novel role of IL-17 in UVB induced SASP and carcinogenesis. We
will determine whether IL-17 is a component and an upstream regulator of UVB induced SASP and examine
molecular mechanisms by which IL-17 regulates SASP. Further studies will examine whether blockade of IL-17
diminishes the susceptibility of mice to photocarcinogenesis. Aim 3 will determine whether CD11b+/PD-L1+
cells are specific tolerogenic APC for the induction of Treg cells and tolerance and whether blockade of PD-
1/PD-L1 reverses established immune tolerance in UVB-tolerized mice. Further studies will examine whether
blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibits photocarcinogenesis and whether a combination with neutralizing IL-17
enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy for UVB induced skin tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 According to American Cancer Society, most skin cancers are a direct result of exposure to the
ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight and have also been linked to exposure to some artificial sources of UV rays

major risk factor for skin cancer and remains to be fully understood. The current application will investigate

5F32HL144040-02,TRPC4-DEPENDENT CYTOSOLIC CALCIUM SIGNALS COORDINATE INTERENDOTHELIAL FORCES THAT ELICIT GAP FORMATION,"Project Summary
 Acute lung injury is a disorder of acute inflammation that causes disruption of the pulmonary endothelial barrier
and contributes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. Endothelial barrier integrity
is critically determined by endothelial cytosolic calcium ion (Ca2+) transients that are activated by the plasma
membrane store-operated Ca2+ entry (ISOC) channels. One of the channel subunits, canonical transient receptor
potential 4 (TRPC4) protein, critically regulates channel activation and Ca2+ influx. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ is
sufficient to induce interendothelial gaps in extra-alveolar segments and cause pulmonary edema. However, the
mechanism by which TRPC4-dependent Ca2+ influx disrupts adherens junction and coordinates
interendothelial forces is poorly understood and is the focus of this application.
 Cytosolic Ca2+ is not stable but rather fluctuates within a confluent endothelial monolayer. TRPC4 contributes to
these basal cytosolic Ca2+ transients. Inflammatory agonists induce Ca2+ influx by activating the TRPC4 ISOC
channel leading to a marked elevation of cytosolic Ca2+, which causes endothelial cell retraction and gap formation.
However, it is unknown whether these TRPC4-dependent transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ cause increases
in the coordination of interendothelial forces, interendothelial gap formation, and lung edema.
 Inflammatory diseases are related to changes in mechanical properties of cells and tissues. Intercellular
forces are spatially heterogeneous, highly cooperative, and aligned into force chains. During inflammation,
disruption of the vascular endothelial barrier is partially initiated through cytoskeletal contraction of a group of
cells. The resulting increased contractile forces propagate across neighboring cells via intercellular junctions to
increase interendothelial force coordination and correlation, increase intracellular force alignment and extend
force chains far outside the gap regions. A large accumulation of contractile forces may eventually exceed the
maximum force that an adherens junction can withstand and cause the formation of an interendothelial gap. An
interendothelial gap also may form at a tri-junctional (tricellular junction) point where force chains are
misaligned and may pull the adherens junction apart. However, it is unknown how TRPC4-dependent cytosolic
Ca2+ transients are related to interendothelial force correlation at baseline and after agonist challenge. This proposal
tests the overall HYPOTHESIS that TRPC4 activation triggers unique cytosolic Ca2+ transients that are sufficient to
increase interendothelial force correlation and promote gap formation, pulmonary permeability, and pulmonary
edema.","Project Narrative
Lung inflammation causes calcium ion influx into pulmonary endothelial cells, leading to gap formation in the
vessel wall, increases in vascular permeability, and lung edema. This proposal is designed to test the
hypothesis that channel-dependent calcium signals increase the contractile forces within endothelial cells that
elicit interendothelial gap formation and increase lung permeability. If the hypothesis is correct, then reducing
coordination of interendothelial forces could be a potential therapeutic target for lung edema patients.",2019,63746,63746,,"Training, Individual",F32,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,AL,MOBILE,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,366880002,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Lung; Rare Diseases,NINGYONG  XU
1R01NS112203-01,14-3-3 phosphorylation in Parkinson's disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Two critical proteins linked to Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) are alpha-synuclein (Î±syn) and LRRK2. Mutations in
either gene cause autosomal dominant forms of PD, and GWAS studies have pointed to variants in both genes
as risk factors for developing idiopathic PD. Although both proteins lead to a similar pathological outcome, how
these two proteins cause neuronal injury and how they interact in the disease process are not well understood.
Our key discovery is that 14-3-3Î¸ is a major regulator of both Î±syn and LRRK2 and could be the missing link
between Î±syn and LRRK2. 14-3-3s are multifunctional, highly expressed brain proteins that act as chaperones,
affect protein trafficking, and modulate enzymatic activity of their binding partners. Our research has highlighted
the role of these critical proteins in PD and their interplay with both Î±syn and LRRK2. We have observed that
14-3-3Î¸ acts as a chaperone to reduce Î±syn aggregation and cell-to-cell transmission, and this same 14-3-3
isoform reduces the kinase activity and toxicity of mutant LRRK2.
 While our data clearly points to a potentially critical role for 14-3-3 dysfunction in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, a key
question that remains is how 14-3-3Î¸â€™s endogenous functions could become impaired in PD. We propose that
aberrant phosphorylation of 14-3-3Î¸ is the critical pathophysiologic event, and that increases in 14-3-3Î¸
phosphorylation promotes LRRK2 and Î±syn effects in disease. In support of this hypothesis, we recently
published data showing that 14-3-3Î¸ phosphorylation at S232 is dramatically elevated in the detergent-insoluble
fractions from human PD and DLB brains. This increase in S232 phosphorylation correlates with cognitive
decline and pathological severity measures, consistent with a role of S232 phosphorylation in the pathogenesis
of neurodegeneration. In addition, we have observed that mitochondrial stress promotes 14-3-3Î¸
phosphorylation at S232 in culture. The S232D phosphomimetic mutant loses its protective effects in neurotoxin
and Î±syn culture models.
 Based on these data, we hypothesize that oxidative stress is a key upstream inducer of excessive 14-3-3Î¸

 Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. While current treatments
mitigate the symptoms and disability associated with PD, no treatments slow or reverse the neurodegenerative
process. Recent work points to a significant role for inflammation in PD pathogenesis. In work supported by the
P20 Exploratory Project (NS09530), we found evidence for activation of innate immunity in animal models of PD,
and obtained preliminary data implicating immunomodulation in human samples. Expanding this research to a
more complete study of inflammatory changes in human subjects with PD is essential to define the role of
inflammation in human disease and thus aid in the development of potential immunomodulatory disease
modifying therapies. The primary goal of the Clinical Research Core is to establish a well-characterized cohort
of early stage, idiopathic PD subjects for longitudinal study with regard to neuroinflammation. This cohort will
provide clinical data, biospecimens, and imaging data that will directly support the three research projects
proposed under the P50 grant. The Core will recruit, clinically assess, and follow annually 60 age- and sex-
matched controls and 60 subjects with early stage, untreated, idiopathic PD at UAB. CSF, plasma, and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected at baseline, and plasma and PBMCs will be collected at
annual follow-up visits. [18F]DPA-714 PET imaging will be performed on this cohort at baseline to assess central
inflammation in early stage, idiopathic PD. All participant data will be submitted to the Data Management
Resource (DMR) under the NINDSâ€™ Parkinsonâ€™s disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), and approved
biospecimens will be sent to the NINDS repository BioSEND. In conjunction with Columbia University, the Core
will also recruit LRRK2 G2019S carriers with PD (n=20) and without PD (n=20), and LRRK2 G2019S NON-
carriers with PD (n=20) and without PD (n=20). Biospecimens and clinical data from patients previously
genotyped for mutations in LRRK2 will feed directly into Project 3.",,2019,532927,375820,157107,Research Centers,P50,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease,Talene Alene Yacoubian

The Southeastern Medical Scientist Symposium (SEMSS) was established in 2010 by students from
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Emory University, and Vanderbilt University Medical
Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs). The three programs have co-hosted the symposium for six
years with the location rotating among Birmingham (2010, 2013), Atlanta (2011, 2014), and Nashville
(2012, 2015). The objective of the symposium is to encourage a collaborative and interdisciplinary
educational environment within the Southeast region of the United States. This fully student-
organized symposium seeks to foster connections between the MD/PhD students at multiple
institutions across the Southeast, exposing students to trends, challenges, and opportunities inherent
in careers of academic physicians. Future SEMSS meetings will continue to rotate locations between
Birmingham, Atlanta, and Nashville in order to optimize regional student participation. The program of
each SEMSS has and will continue to include keynote speaker presentations, multiple topic-specific
breakout sessions, MSTP student research oral and poster sessions, and social events. The
breakout sessions are divided into sessions of interest to MD/PhD students, undergraduates, and
residents/fellows. The meetings span two days, with content starting in the early afternoon on a
Saturday and ending in the early afternoon on Sunday. The target audience for the SEMSS is
MD/PhD students in training programs in the southeast and residents/fellows, MD students, and
undergraduate students at southeastern institutions who have an interest in future careers as
physician-scientists. An additional purpose of this symposium is to expose undergraduate students to
physician-scientist trainees and faculty in order to foster excitement about careers in academic
medicine and increase the pipeline of future physician-scientists. We think that this additional focus
on undergraduate students from the region is critical to our purpose of enhancing the pipeline of
students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URIM), as according to US News and
World Report, nine of the top twenty historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are located
in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, or Louisiana.","Narrative

maintaining and improving the biomedical workforce, as in recent decades the number of
physicians who conduct scientific research has been in decline. The Southeastern Medical
Scientist Symposium (SEMSS) will provide a venue to foster connections between and
enhance training for MD/PhD students at multiple institutions across the Southeast. In
addition, the SEMSS will foster excitement among undergraduate students about careers in

5F31DA044013-02,7T Functional MRS Assessment of Pain Processing in Cannabis Users,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lagging behind rapid changes to state laws, societal views, and medical practice is the scientific investigation
of cannabis's impact on the human brain. As recently as March of 2017, 28 states and the District of Columbia
had enacted legislation that facilitates using cannabis to treat various medical conditions, including chronic
pain, neuropathic pain, and pain related to cancer treatment options (e.g., chemotherapy). Yet, the analgesic
properties of cannabis are not well understood. Convergent evidence points to neurotransmitter system
disruptions among cannabis users, including gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, in brain
regions related to pain processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most powerful
non-invasive ways to investigate the neurobiological systems that support psychological processes such as
perceiving pain. Indeed, a modest literature on pain has linked somatosensory pain perception to the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies â€“ a manuscript
on which the applicant served as primary author â€“ found that cannabis use was associated with reduced
activation throughout the ACC among users. Given the disruption of neurotransmitter systems among cannabis
users, including GABA and glutamate, an important challenge facing the field is to determine how cannabis-
related changes in behavior and neural activation during pain processing are linked to changes in subservient
neurochemistry. Functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) can be used to address this challenge
by measuring neurotransmitter fluctuations associated with cannabis-related differences in behavior and neural
activation between cannabis-using and non-cannabis-using subjects. Using fMRS to examine somatosensory
pain perception is well supported, however, studies extending this approach to cannabis users are lacking.
Moreover, most fMRS investigations have been performed using lower magnetic field strengths (i.e., 3T, or
less), likely limiting abilities to effectively detect neurotransmitter fluctuations. Given the paucity of studies
involving fMRS, and given the potential to examine neurotransmitter fluctuations during pain processing among
cannabis users via fMRS, our overall goals are to examine the neurochemical correlates that may support
cannabis-related differences in pain perception between users and non-users. To accomplish these goals, we
propose to implement fMRS at a greater magnetic field strength (i.e., 7T) during somatosensory pressure-
based pain among cannabis-using and non-cannabis-using subjects, using an MR-compatible pressure-based
pain apparatus.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Converging evidence points toward cannabis-related changes in neurotransmitter systems, including GABA
and glutamate, within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during pain processing. In this proposal, we aim to
leverage functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) to detect neurotransmitter fluctuations during
acute somatosensory pressure-based pain among cannabis-using subjects and non-cannabis-using subjects.
This work may enhance current understanding of cannabis's effects on the human brain, as well as provide
evidence for a non-invasive tool for examining neurochemical changes supporting behavioral differences

5I01BX003754-03,Identifying Approaches to Enhance Bone and Cartilage Regeneration,"Failure to properly heal bone fractures is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the
need to properly form bone is vital to successful outcomes from surgeries ranging from joint replacement to
spinal fusion to dental implants. In an aging population, the biomedical need is even greater. The recent
identification of skeletal progenitor cells, composed of 8 subpopulations, capable of forming all three
components of the skeleton, bone, cartilage and stroma, promises to have a major impact on improving the
outcomes for these therapies. A key question that remains is what are the factors affecting eventual cell fate of
these skeletal progenitor cells. Our data on the matricellular protein DEL1 have shown it has an impact on
skeletal repair. We have preliminary data indicating that it has a direct effect on skeletal progenitor cell biology
and we propose that DEL1 plays an important role in their biology.
 Prior to this, our data had shown DEL1 had a biological effect on chondrocytes, but not on osteoblasts. We
demonstrated decreased numbers of mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs), and bone, cartilage, stroma
progenitors (BCSPs), the skeletal progenitor most important in fracture healing in the fracture callus, and we
propose the mechanism for decreased bone formation after fracture is due to an effect on skeletal progenitors
ability to expand after fracture. We plan on examining this first by isolating mSSCs and BCSPs, from knockout
(KO) and wild type (WT) mice and comparing their biology. We will examine the biology of BCSPs using in vitro
assays for cell proliferation, osteogenic and chondrogenic potential. BCSPs develop a different phenotype
termed the fracture BCSP (f-BCSP) that has greater proliferative ability and osteogenic potential after fracture,
and we will test whether the same change occurs in our KO mice. We will perform in vivo assays for
osteogenesis by implanting BCSPs into the renal capsule to examine how well they form bone.
 A key question in understanding how DEL1 affects formation of bone after fracture is to understand what
happens to skeletal progenitors after fracture in WT and KO mice. We will use lineage tracing techniques with
mice currently in our laboratory to examine the fate of daughter cells from individual clones of skeletal
progenitors cells.
 The final series of experiments represent our initial approaches to translating use of DEL1 into potential
therapies. First, we will perform a carefully controlled microarray experiment to identify pathways altered in KO
skeletal progenitors compared to WT. We will examine the ability of exogenous DEL1 to promote viability and
growth of skeletal stem cells grown in vitro. We will test the ability of DEL1 to stimulate bone and cartilage
formation of skeletal progenitor cells implanted into the renal capsule. Finally, we will examine whether
exogenous DEL1 protein placed at a fracture site can enhance normal fracture healing. We will also use a
separate model of poor fracture healing with mice that have undergone hindlimb irradiation.
 In summary, we will examine how Del1 affects the biology of skeletal progenitor cells. In addition to
providing steps to potentially translate these discoveries into therapies, these experiments can provide us with
mechanistic answers about how lack of Del1 leads to decreased bone in fracture healing. They will provide
insight into the factors that affect the potential fate of skeletal progenitor cells.","The experiments proposed here are aimed at improving our understanding of skeletal stem cells. These are
cells capable of producing all three components of the skeleton, bone, cartilage and stroma. Understanding the
biology of these skeletal stem cells is highly relevant for the healthcare of veterans. The need for new bone
formation is important in a number of surgical procedures including spinal fusion, joint replacement and dental
implants. These surgeries represent some of the most common procedures performed in the veteran
population. A major concern in the success of these procedures is the formation of quality new bone to support
the secure the implant. Understanding how to improve bone formation can decrease complications of all these
procedures. Furthermore, it has the potential to allow for new bone formation in critical defects of returning
warfighters who are suffering large numbers of extremity injuries in current conflicts.",2019,,,,Non-SBIR/STTR,I01,Veterans Affairs,BIRMINGHAM VA MEDICAL CENTER,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Independent Hospitals,352331927,,GEORGE P YANG
5F31DK115074-03,Vitamin D and soluble Klotho inhibit FGF23-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in Chronic Kidney Disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and
death. By promoting heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy is an important pathology in CKD and affects up to 90%
of patients by the time they reach dialysis. Elevated serum levels of bone-derived fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) 23 are a common, early metabolic complication of CKD that is strongly associated with cardiovascular
events and mortality. In recent experimental studies, we demonstrated that in this context, FGF23 might act as
a causal factor by directly targeting cardiac myocytes and inducing cardiac hypertrophy. We could show that
FGF23 can specifically activate FGF receptor isoform 4 (FGFR4) and subsequent PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT
signaling leading to hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes that occurs independently of elevations in blood
pressure. Administration of an FGFR4-specific blocking antibody reduced cardiac hypertrophy in the 5/6
nephrectomy rat model of CKD, suggesting that pharmacological interference with myocardial FGF23/FGFR4
signaling might serve as a novel cardio-protective therapeutic approach in CKD. Here, we will study if active
vitamin D (VitD) and soluble klotho (sKL), two endocrine factors with known cardio-protective functions and
whose serum levels are significantly reduced in CKD, confer their anti-hypertrophic actions by blocking
FGF23/FGFR4/PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiac myocytes. This hypothesis is supported by our
preliminary data showing that sKL and VitD block FGF23-induced hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiac
myocytes. In Aim 1, we will determine if these inhibitory actions of sKL and VitD are associated with a
reduction in FGF23-induced PLCÎ³ and NFAT activity. Our preliminary work indicates that VitD inhibits the
FGFR4/PLCÎ³ interaction in FGF23-stimulated cardiac myocytes, and we will study if activated VitD receptor
(VDR) can directly bind PLCÎ³ and/or FGFR4 to block PLCÎ³ activation post FGF23 treatment. Klotho is a
transmembrane protein that binds to FGFRs and acts as co-receptor for FGF23 in the kidney. Here, we will
determine if sKL can also interact with FGF23 and/or FGFR4 thereby blocking FGF23/FGFR4 binding and
subsequent PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiac myocytes. It has been shown that administration of
VitD or sKL in rodent models of CKD reduces cardiac hypertrophy, and our preliminary data in 5/6
nephrectomized rats indicates that VitD inhibits myocardial calcineurin/NFAT activity. In Aim 2, we will
determine if delivery of VitD or sKL can block FGFR4/PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in 5/6 nephrectomized
rats and reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, we will study if administration of VitD or sKL to an
established genetic mouse model for cardiac hypertrophy induced by expression of a constitutively active
FGFR4 mutant form, inhibits FGFR4/PLCÎ³/calcineurin/NFAT signaling and improves cardiac morphology and
function. We postulate that by interfering with FGF23-induced cardiac hypertrophy, administration of sKL and
VitD might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to tackle cardiac injury and death in patients with CKD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Cardiac hypertrophy is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death
of a large number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, circulating levels of
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are markedly elevated, levels of active vitamin D and soluble klotho (sKL)
are severely depressed, and each of these alterations contributes to cardiac hypertrophy. In this proposal, we
will characterize the crosstalk between FGF23, vitamin D and sKL signaling in the heart, and test beneficial
cardiac effects of a novel therapeutic approach that combines administration of vitamin D and sKL in rodent
models of CKD.

5K01HD087463-03,Targeting skeletal muscle to improve metabolic health in individuals with spinal cord injury,"SUMMARY
The proposed research project examines the impact of early utilization of a novel neuromuscular electrical
stimulation (NMES) program on skeletal muscle metabolism and overall metabolic health in individuals with
sub-acute, complete spinal cord injuries (SCI).
Background: Individuals with SCI live longer than before and live to an age where metabolic disorders become
highly prevalent. Due to loss of mobility and severe skeletal muscle atrophy, obesity, glucose intolerance, and
peripheral insulin resistance develop soon after the onset of SCI. These abnormalities are thought to contribute
to the increased diabetes disease risk and accelerated aging process in the SCI population. As a result of
these trends, overall burden of complications, economic impact and reduced quality of life are increasing. Until
there are effective treatments for SCI, it is imperative to develop effective interventions to mitigate metabolic
disorders that develop in individuals with SCI. There is a lack of experienced clinicians and researchers who
have expertise on metabolic health and SCI. Additionally, there is a lack of adequate early interventions to
prevent or reduce the degree of metabolic dysfunction that follows injury.
Implications: The growing population and increased age of individuals with SCI calls for novel and
interdisciplinary rehabilitation approaches to care in order to reduce the economic burden and enhance the
quality of life.
Next Steps: Interdisciplinary rehabilitation researchers are needed to lead the investigations necessary to
address the aforementioned problems and challenges. As a candidate for this training and research proposal, I
am uniquely trained and motivated to commit my career to addressing the challenges associated with the
current trends. My prior research and clinical training ideally position me for an independent research career.
During my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I was actively engaged in research on the development of
exercise and nutrition interventions to improve musculoskeletal and metabolic health in individuals with SCI. I
bring to this research a diverse training background in physical therapy and rehabilitation, human physiology,
and skeletal muscle biology as indicated by my publication record. My postdoctoral experience fostered my
abilities to direct truly translational research by extending clinical research experiences to mechanistic studies
in skeletal muscle and molecular biology. The specific focus of my work that I will build upon involved
understanding the effects of NMES on activity of intracellular signaling pathways for glucose utilization and
muscle growth. I conducted all aspects of SCI projects â€“ from subject recruitment, to clinical studies, to
molecular and histological assays in the laboratory. My postdoctoral experiments revealed novel findings,
some of which are detailed in the Research Strategy, providing strong support for the hypotheses of my
proposal. The early results of these experiments show exciting possibilities for a quick and effective increase in
insulin sensitivity and improvements in muscle phenotype in individuals with SCI who have pre-diabetes
without use of medication. My enthusiasm for these findings is based on the potential for prevention.
Through this work, I have found there is much work to be done and that more training in the space between
disciplines (rehabilitation and metabolic disease) will enhance my effectiveness as a rehabilitation researcher.
I seek an NICHD-sponsored K01 award to support investigations of a combined (resistance + aerobic) NMES
training protocol for inducing physiological adaptations necessary to optimize metabolic health in individuals
with sub-acute SCI. In addition, I will use the protected time for training in energy metabolism, metabolomics,
and clinical trial design and implementation. These activities will ultimately prepare me for a productive,
independent career focused on translating findings from basic research into feasible, clinical
interventions to reduce the risk of metabolic disease in the chronic stages of SCI without use of
medication. I am currently in the ideal environment to execute the proposed investigations and have
assembled a mentoring team of renowned scientists in in the disciplines necessary to integrate this
intervention approach. Additionally, I have access to state-of-the-art research laboratories, core facilities and
equipment as well as the ability to recruit patients from a nationally recognized rehabilitation hospital.
The novelty of the proposed project lies in the rigorous examination of the effects a combined (aerobic +
resistance) NMES program on skeletal muscle metabolism and in the application of novel targeted
metabolomics approaches to understand the influence of muscle adaptations on overall metabolic health
immediately after SCI (as opposed to studying deconditioned, chronic SCI). If, as hypothesized, SCI individuals
treated with a combined NMES prescription over the 6 weeks following the injury maintain a healthy muscle
mass and metabolism as well as overall metabolic profile, future intervention efforts can focus on 1)
preventing negative muscle adaptations in the acute stages of SCI, and 2) utilizing home-based
training for life-long maintenance of overall health and quality of life.","Narrative: There is a high prevalence of metabolic disorders in individuals with SCI. The
proposed study will contribute to public health by addressing early methods to prevent diabetes

1R01NR016443-01A1,Evaluation of a Ketogenic Diet for Improvement of Neurological Recovery in Individuals with Acute Spinal Cord Injury,"ABSTRACT
Despite extensive research, clinical advancements, and improved rehabilitation strategies, spinal
cord injury (SCI) continues to be a significant cause of disability and mortality worldwide, and no
pharmacologic therapy has demonstrated significant improvement effects in the neurological or
functional recovery of individuals with SCI. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative
therapies for improving neurorecovery after SCI. The scientific premise of this project builds upon
accumulating evidence that diet-based therapies, such as the ketogenic diet (KD), offer effective
neuroprotection against secondary injury cascades and improve forelimb motor function in a rat
model of SCI. The KD is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the metabolic and
biochemical changes that occur during calorie restriction, specifically ketosis. Ketone bodies have
been shown to exert neuroprotective effects by attenuating neuroinflammation and inhibiting
apoptosis in the spinal cord. Because neuroinflammation and induction of apoptotic pathways
lead to progressive degeneration in the spinal cord shortly after the injury, inhibition of these
processes by ketone bodies may enhance neurological recovery after an SCI. Indeed, our recent
pilot study showed for the first time that, compared with a standard hospital diet (SD), 5 weeks of
KD improved upper extremity motor function in patients with acute SCI. In addition, levels of a
neuroinflammatory blood protein, fibrinogen, were lower in the KD serum samples than in the SD
serum samples, suggesting a KD may induce anti-inflammatory effects in part by reducing
fibrinogen. The acute stage after SCI is also characterized by hyperglycemia, which is strongly
associated with poor functional outcomes at discharge. In our pilot study, fasting serum glucose
levels decreased by 24 mg/dl in the KD group but increased by 0.7 mg/dl in the SD group. These
provocative findings have led us to our central hypothesis that SCI patients who consume a KD
over the first 5 weeks (average hospital stay) after injury will have better neurological recovery,
functional independence, and glycemic control than the SCI patients who consume an SD during
this period. We will test this hypothesis in a randomized, controlled trial with two specific aims: 1)
Determine if 5 weeks of KD vs. SD significantly improves motor and sensory function, functional
independence, and glycemic control in patients with acute SCI, and 2) Quantify serum biomarkers
that are responsible for improvements in neurological recovery and functional independence. Our
findings will uncover the molecular mechanisms by which targeted nutritional strategies can
promote neurorecovery shortly after SCI and may lead to a safe, effective, simple, and economical
intervention that improves health outcomes after SCI.","NARRATIVE
Despite extensive research, no pharmacologic therapy has demonstrated significant
improvement effects in the neurological or functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury
(SCI), and the need for innovative therapies remains urgent. On the basis of preliminary data in
rodents and patients, we have designed a randomized, controlled trial to examine the effects of a
novel nutritional intervention, the ketogenic diet, on improving sensory and motor recovery,
functional independence, and glycemic control in patients with acute SCI and on the molecular
mechanisms thereof. Our findings may lead to a safe, effective, simple, and economical
intervention that improves health outcomes for these patients.",2019,376734,253693,123041,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Institute of Nursing Research,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Injury - Trauma - (Head and Spine); Neurosciences; Nutrition; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Spinal Cord Injury,Ceren  Yarar-Fisher

Tuskegee University Center for Biomedical Research (CBR) Research Centers at Minority Institutions
(RCMI) proposes the Investigator Development Core (IDC) to provide junior-level and transitional
investigators at Tuskegee University (TU) with the necessary resources and training to assist them in
their move to the status of independent researchers focused on minority health and health disparities.
The IDC is intended to support primarily: 1) faculty members who are already in the field of biomedical
research but, because of their junior status, require a period of mentored career development in order
to become independent scientists in the fields of minority health and health disparities research; 2)
Those who have an established career in either a non-biomedical field or a biomedical field in an area
not directly linked to minority health but now desire to move into biomedical research or who want to
include minority health and health disparities, or the translation of it, in their research.
Specifically, the IDC aims to: 1) Provide funding for developmental pilot research projects that
demonstrate the potential for becoming independent, fundable R-series or equivalent proposals
following their completion; 2) Provide pilot-level funding to traditionally non-biomedical, innovative
research approaches that address minority health and health disparities; 3) Provide and coordinate
senior-level mentorship and research training and career developmental activities for junior-level
investigators who receive funding for Center for Biomedical Research (CBR)/RCMI pilot research
projects.
To achieve these aims, the IDC will integrate its efforts with the infrastructure core, the community

obesity, and prostate cancer, all of which disproportionately affect African Americans and
underrepresented minorities. In other words, the goal is to continue support for a competitive, multidisciplinary
collaborative environment that advances biomedical research. Tuskegee University has distinctive strengths
because it is located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African
American population, and it has a large number of minority faculty members as well as undergraduate and
graduate trainees. The goal of the CBR/RCMI will be accomplished through establishment of three synergistic
research cores, with services to enable investigative research on health inequities among minority groups,
especially African-Americans residing in the â€˜Black Beltâ€™ counties of Alabama. These cores create a stimulating
environment that promotes a culture of efficient and timely administrative support that will increase the number
of funding submissions and/or acquisitions of extramural funding in biomedical and community engagement
research. The Administrative Core will provide multi-functional support through pre- and post-award services;
implementation of objectives, directions, and guidance; and oversight to ensure that specific aims and
objectives are accomplished. Additionally, the Investigator Development Core will support the development of
additional areas of research while enhancing the growth of junior faculty through senior mentorship and
bioethics training. Further, through our community engagement core, we will establish relationships, build trust,
and engage local communities and community-based organizations to learn from and to educate community
members on health issues that affect them. We will also implement an evaluation plan to assess, over a period
of five years, the progress, productivity, and accountability of the CBR by using both formative and summative
outcomes. The outcome is to increase, by an approved and enforceable protocol that focuses on junior faculty
development and productivity, the number of R-type grants awarded and the number of publications in peer-
reviewed journals. The availability of advanced research equipment, coupled with the new knowledge
generated by TU PhD students, scientists, and collaborators will contribute to the reduction of health disparities
in the Black Belt counties of Alabama.","PROJECT NARRATIVE (Overall)

5F31DA047015-02,Balanced Placebo Design with Varenicline: Pharmacological and Expectancy Effects on Medication Adherence,"Smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., accounting for one in
five deaths each year. Varenicline (Chantix) is a partial nicotinergic agonist and is the most
efficacious monotherapy for successful smoking cessation; however, long-term abstinence with
varenicline only ranges from 20% â€“ 40%. One contributing factor to this low effectiveness may be
poor medication adherence due to nonspecific side effects (i.e., side effects not explained by the
pharmacology of the medication, but possibly due to negative medication expectancies or nicotine
withdrawal symptoms that are mistakenly attributed to medication use). Nonspecific side effects have
been linked to negative outcomes such as nonadherence, discontinuing effective treatment, and
attempts to treat these symptoms with additional medications. The current proposal will utilize the
double-blind balanced placebo design to differentiate expectancies versus pharmacologic
mechanisms of varenicline administered for two weeks to smokers seeking treatment. The double-
blind balanced placebo design includes a cross-balanced medication administration (active
medication v. placebo) and instructional set (told truth v. deception) resulting in four groups of
smokers seeking treatment: (1) told therapeutic dose (TD) medication + received TD medication; (2)
told TD medication + received placebo; (3) told low dose (LD) medication+ received TD dose
medication; (4) told LD medication + received placebo. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) in
the form of Daily Dairies delivered via smartphone will assess real-time side effects, withdrawal
symptoms, cigarettes smoked, medication use, and reasons for medication non-adherence. The
specific aims for this proposal will examine the main effects and interaction of instructional set and
pharmacology on medication adherence (Aims 1 and 2) and evaluate moderators of pharmacology
and expectancy effects on medication adherence (Exploratory Aim). Assessing expectancies and
physiological barriers (i.e., non-specific side effects) to varenicline medication adherence will identify
targets to improve medication adherence and to develop behavioral interventions that can modify and
reframe negative expectancies and experiences. The specific aims of this project will be completed in
conjunction with a formal training plan, sponsored by Dr. Karen Cropsey, Dr. Peter Hendricks, Dr.
Michael Businelle, Dr. Richard Shelton, and Dr. Sylvie Mrug. This training plan includes: 1)
pharmacological research development, 2) EMA methodology, 3) advanced longitudinal data
analysis, and 4) research dissemination and mentorship.","Smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable death and disease within the United States with
over 480,000 cigarette smoking related deaths occurring annually, which is nearly 1 in every 5 deaths. This

inform interventions that can modify and reframe negative expectancies. The long-term goal of this study is to
understand the underlying causes of varenicline non-adherence, which will identify targets to improve

5P30DK074038-15,The Hepato/Renal Fibrocystic Diseases Engineered Models Resource: Core B,"ABSTRACT
Renal and hepatic cysts along with fibrosis (Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease, HRFD) are phenotypes observed
in a large number of human syndromes (PKD, MKS, NPHP, JBTS, and BBS), the most prevalent of which is
PKD. Unfortunately, current treatments for HRFDs are largely palliative and new more efficacious strategies
are needed to retard or reverse cyst progression. Animal models that develop HRFDs have been instrumental
in advancing our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of these disorders and also serve as
preclinical platforms to test candidate therapeutic and means of intervention. One key theme derived from
these models is that most mutations causing HRFDs occur in genes that encode cilia proteins or proteins that
are required for cilia assembly or function. While animal models of HRFDs are essential tools for advancing
the field, there are many hurdles that prevent their full utilization in many labs. This includes the expertise,
cost, and effort required to set up and generate the models and their ready availability. It can often take a year
to establish new models at an investigator's home institution, which is prohibitive for rapid testing of novel
hypotheses. To help reduce these hurdles and to increase the pace of research into HRFDs, the UAB
Engineered Models Core (Core B) will generate mutations in HRFD/cilia related genes in cell lines, C.
elegans, zebrafish, and mice using CRISPR based strategies and through ES cells provided by the mouse
targeted knockout consortia. The Core will also generate in vivo mouse and zebrafish models expressing
human disease alleles. This will allow the assessment of the pathogenic consequence of missense mutations
in cyst progression. To facilitate intravital analyses of pathways associated with cystic disease, Core B will
generate several biosensor lines to evaluate changes in cytosolic and ciliary Ca2+ and cAMP levels as well as a
CiliaRFP mouse to visualize and analyze cilia in live tissues in situ. It can often take up to a year to establish
new models at an investigator's home institution which prevents the rapid testing of novel hypotheses. PKD,
MKS, NPHP, JBTS, and BBS models made available through Core B's efforts will be essential resources for
analyzing cystogenic pathways and in preclinical trails that will conducted by the user base through the
Center's Cell Physiology Core (Core C) and the Therapeutic Screening and Development Core (Core D).
Finally, Core B will benefit Center members by providing biological reagents (tissue samples, blood, urine,
DNA, RNA, protein) derived from our HRFD mutant models. These resources will facilitate pilot studies to test
innovative hypotheses, preliminary studies needed for grant submissions, and conformational studies of in vitro
findings without requiring the line be established at an investigators home institution. Overall, these genetic
tools and biological resources that will be made available through Core B will provide a comprehensive and
integrated set of resources examining the role of cilia and HRFD genes in cyst pathogenesis and for analyzing
new treatment strategies.",,2019,225294,153261,72033,Research Centers,P30,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,Domestic Higher Education,352940001,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Kidney Disease; Pediatric; Polycystic Kidney Disease; Rare Diseases,Bradley K.

5T32GM008111-32,"Training Program in Cell, Molecular, and Developmental Biology","ABSTRACT
The training program in Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology (CMDB) was founded at UAB in the early
1970s with a commitment to develop scholars who are well prepared for the challenges inherent to a career in
biomedical research/education. Graduate education at UAB is through the interdepartmental-based Graduate
Biomedical Sciences (GBS) umbrella program that combines an innovative problem-based core curriculum with
small group learning modules focused on thematic areas. The CMDB T32 program integrates with the GBS
curriculum and workshops on scientific integrity and reproducibility, and career and development programs. The
training approach has four basic components composed of 1) a didactic and inductive/student-driven learning
curriculum, 2) a mentored research project, 3) practical experiences in scientific writing, review, and
communication, and 4) career development opportunities. The CMDB T32 provides enhanced training and
support for a select group of highly-talented predoctoral trainees that are interested in basic and clinical research
related to cell and developmental mechanisms that contribute to normal and altered physiology, disease
pathogenesis, and birth defects. Importantly, CMDB is unique at UAB in that it is the only T32 program that
supports predoctoral trainees independent of a disease focus, thus, extending opportunities to high-caliber
trainees that would otherwise be ineligible due to the nature of their research. The CMDB training program is
highly competitive with 114 predoctoral trainees currently in CMDB mentor laboratories. The program receives
on average 32 applicants annually for only 8 positions, thus, the highly qualified applicant pool of trainees far
exceeds the number of positions. CMDB is strengthened by robust University commitments that include support
for the CMDB T32 Directors Fund. The Directors Fund provides added value programs such as the annual multi-
institutional scientific retreat between UAB, Vanderbilt, St. Jude's, and UT-Memphis, the CMDB Distinguished
Lectureship Series, CMDB Chalk Talk and Works in Progress, and trainee participation in career development
workshops and meetings. The CMDB T32 establishes a vibrant and effective training environment by bringing
together a collaborative group of 57 basic and clinical scientists. These mentors were selected on the basis of
their collegiality, their research focus, productivity, and support, and most importantly, their strong commitment
to predoctoral mentorship. The CMDB T32 training program has a long track record of success. Compared to
national averages, the CMDB trainees' completion rates are remarkably high (89%) and they have a shorter
median time to degree (5.5 years). They have a high success rate in continuing on in scientific research,
education, law, or policy/management in academia, industry or government careers. The success of this program
is also evidenced by the 184 peer-reviewed manuscripts published by CMDB T32 trainees over the past 10
years, averaging 3.8 papers per trainee. Importantly, the overall quality of the CMDB T32 experience is enhanced
by the incredibly collaborative and collegial environment entrenched in the UAB scientific culture.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Diseases (HRFDs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders that together are a major
cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children and adults. Current treatments are largely directed
toward managing disease symptoms. The principal objectives of the UAB Hepatorenal Fibrocystic Disease
Core Center (HRFDCC) are to expedite basic, preclinical, and clinical research into the genetic causes and
pathogenic mechanisms of HRFDs and to accelerate the translation of new discoveries into more effective
diagnostics and treatments. The HRFDCC is a multi-institutional Center with four contemporary Biomedical
Cores that support the research activities of a large national and international Investigator Base. Oversight of
the Center is provided through an Administrative Core that will be responsible for ensuring the overall quality
and effectiveness of the Biomedical Cores, a Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) and Voucher Program, and a suite of
Educational Enrichment and Training opportunities. The Administrative Core is tasked with setting priorities
and the overall scientific and clinical research direction of the Center. Additionally, the Administrative Core is
responsible for coordinating activities between the HRFDCC and other NIH and University-supported Centers.
This includes joint educational, mentoring, and career development activities with other P30-PKD Centers, the
CTSAs at each of the HRFDCC institutions, and with the UAB/UCSD O'Brien Center and the UAB Nephrology
Research and Training Center (NRTC). The Administrative Core will organize an annual internal and external
review of all the Center's Programs and be responsible for ensuring that changes recommended by the
Advisory Committees are implemented. A final important role of the Administrative Core is to maintain effective
communication and collaborative interactions between the HRFDCC and the Investigator Base to provide
updated information about the Center's services and resources, as well as new funding, educational, and
training opportunities. This will be accomplished through a content-rich website and video conferencing of our

5R01DK115752-02,Injury Response Mediated Pathogenesis in Renal Ciliopathies,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The objectives of this proposal are to understand a new role for cilia in regulating tissue injury responses and
to define a mechanism by which cilia dysfunction results in renal cysts. Mice with conditional mutations in genes
disrupting cilia formation (e.g., intraflagellar transport 88 (Ift88)) or cilia function (i.e., polycystin 2 (Pkd2)) reveal
that the rate of cyst formation depends on the age at which mutations are induced. If disruption occurs in juvenile
mice, cysts form uniformly across the kidney within a few weeks. Conversely, if loss is induced in adult mice,
cyst formation is slow requiring over six month, with cysts found in localized regions. However, the rate of cyst
formation and number of nephrons affected in the adult-induced mutants is increased by renal injury. These data
led us to propose that cilia are needed for responses to tissue injury and that the focal cysts in the adult-induced
cilia mutants occur in a few nephrons that have received an injury and are unable to undergo normal repair.
 The cystic kidney phenotype in Pkd2 mutants is significantly more severe than when cilia are disrupted. Thus,
it was surprising that Pkd2 mutants that also lack cilia (e.g., Pkd2;Ift88 double mutants) have reduced cystic
pathology that is similar to what is observed in the Ift88 mutant alone. This epistatic relationship can be explained
by a model in which cilia are needed for both activation and repression of pathway(s) involved in injury and
repair. This is identical to the role that cilia play in hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Cilia are needed for Hh, patched,
and smoothened to activate the pathway and to generate the Gli activator, but cilia are also needed to generate
the Gli3 repressor to turn the pathway off. By analogy, we are proposing a similar relationship between the
polycystins and cilia during cyst formation. However, this model does not explain why cysts develop rapidly in
non-injured, juvenile-induced mutants. Our studies reveal that macrophage subtypes change during postnatal
renal maturation and that the subtypes characteristic of the juvenile period rapidly return following injury.
However, in the absence of cilia, this transition process is dysregulated and the response to injury becomes
exacerbated or prolonged. Thus, cilia are important for intercellular communication between the epithelium and
immune cells and loss of cilia deregulates this injury response driving cyst formation.
 Through this proposal we will define a novel requirement for cilia following injury, identify and test pathways
involved in cilia-regulated injury response, and determine how cilia dysfunction alters intercellular signaling
pathways during cyst initiation and expansion. The role of the cilium in the kidney, and many other tissues
affected in ciliopathies, has been painfully elusive. Thus, accomplishing the goals of this proposal would be a
major advance in understanding of cilia function and the pathogenesis of ciliopathy disorders. Ultimately, this
work will identify new therapeutic targets to slow cyst progression in human ciliopathy patients.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
A number of human syndromes exhibit renal cysts and fibrosis that cause substantial morbidity and mortality.
The cellular basis for most cystic kidney disorders is the dysfunction of the primary cilium; however, the function
of the cilium in the kidney is not understood. In this proposal, we will determine the role that cilia play on epithelial
cells to regulate injury responses in the kidney and determine how loss of cilia function results in altered signaling

5R01CA208272-03,Developing novel combination therapies for pancreatic cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease. For the majority of patients chemotherapy
is the only therapeutic option, and virtually all patients relapse with drug resistant disease. The nucleoside
analogue gemcitabine is the frontline agent and current standard of care for patients with PDAC. When
combined with gemcitabine, erlotinib or nab-paclitaxel increases median survival of patients with non-
resectable disease by ~0.3 to ~1.8 months, respectively. The five-year survival is ~6%. Clearly more effective
therapies are needed.
 We propose to develop effective therapy for patients with PDAC. Our data demonstrate that the
combinations of gemcitabine + the BET (bromodomain extra-terminal domain) inhibitor JQ1 and also of JQ1 +
the PARP 1/2 inhibitor olaparib induce strongly synergistic cytotoxicity in PDAC cells in vitro. Notably, a pilot
study with JQ1 + gemcitabine supports in vitro data, and shows that this combination induces regressions in
mice bearing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. The synergy of both combinations that we propose to
evaluate was evident in PDAC cells that express mutant KRAS, a tumor cell characteristic associated with poor
outcome clinically. The data suggest that JQ1 + gemcitabine and JQ1 + olaparib may comprise effective
therapy for PDAC.
 JQ1 is a novel targeted small molecule that binds to acetyl lysine binding pockets of BET proteins,
predominantly BRD2 and BRD4. This binding inhibits the association of BRD2/4-dependent transcriptional
aggregates to acetylated lysine residues of histones, thereby inhibiting expression of proteins dependent on
this mechanism. Data in this proposal show the novel findings that JQ1 induces DNA damage, inhibits
expression of the G2 cell cycle regulator protein CDC25B and DNA repair proteins Ku80 and BRCA2 in vivo.
We hypothesize, based on our findings and relevant literature, that JQ1-induced DNA damage, inhibition of
CDC25B and consequent cell cycle dysregulation sensitize PDAC cells to gemcitabine. We also hypothesize,
based on our findings and relevant literature, that JQ1-induced inhibition of Ku80 and BRCA2 and consequent
suppression of DNA repair sensitizes PDAC tumors to PARP inhibitors. We propose to evaluate the efficacy
and mechanisms of synergy of JQ1 + gemcitabine (Aim 1) and JQ1 + olaparib (Aim 2) using transfected PDX-
derived cell lines in vitro and our unique panel of in vivo PDX models that retain specific biologic and genetic
characteristics of their tumors of origin. We also propose to identify additional proteins that contribute to the
cytotoxic mechanism of JQ1 (Aim 3).
 The proposed work comprises an essential step toward our long-range goal of developing effective
therapy for patients with PDAC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease, with a 5-year survival of less than 6%. To
improve therapeutic outcome, we need to understand the biology of the disease, have model systems that
reflect characteristics of primary PDAC tumors, and design novel approaches to therapy for patients with
PDAC. We have established a series of PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models including a
gemcitabine-resistant model and KRAS mutant and to propose to use these models to evaluate the efficacy of
the novel combination of JQ1 with gemcitabine or olaparib.",2019,329502,221887,107615,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Cancer Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Biotechnology; Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Pancreatic Cancer; Rare Diseases,Karina J Yoon
5R21AI137799-02,Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule inhibitor,"Project Summary
 Capsular polysaccharides are essential to the virulence of many organisms, including Streptococcus
pneumoniae, which is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia and an important cause of sepsis,
meningitis, and otitis media (middle ear infections). In this bacterium, capsules provide resistance against host-
mediated opsonophagocytosis and are important in both infection and nasopharyngeal colonization. Ninety-
eight distinct capsular serotypes have been identified, each consisting of unique combinations of sugars and
linkages. All but two of the serotypes are synthesized by the Wzy polymerase-dependent mechanism in which
repeat units built on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane are transported to the outer face of the
membrane where they are polymerized into polysaccharide. Nearly all capsules in Gram-positive bacteria, and
a large percentage capsules in Gram-negative bacteria, are synthesized by this mechanism.
 Knowledge of specific factors and mechanisms that could potentially disrupt capsule or its synthesis and
thereby abrogate virulence is lacking. In studies of the Wzy pathway in S. pneumoniae, we detected a novel
inhibitory activity that reduces capsule levels in multiple serotypes by more than ten-fold. Initial characterization
showed the inhibitory component to be a small, heat stable molecule, likely a peptide. The inhibitory activity
was present in a complex mixture that is readily available and amenable to biochemical, analytical, and
physical analyses. The aims of the proposed project are to: 1) identify the inhibitor, and 2) initiate studies to
determine the mechanism by which it affects capsule.
 The results of these studies will have particular significance to understanding novel mechanisms affecting
capsule synthesis. Importantly, they could lay the groundwork for identifying inhibitors capable of reducing
capsule levels during infection, thereby reducing virulence of the organism. Because mechanisms for
synthesizing capsule are shared by many bacteria, the results may also have broad impact. Consequently,
these and follow-up studies will have a high potential to positively impact point of care of patients infected by
capsule-producing bacteria, including those resistant to antibiotics.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

1R01HL149159-01,Metabolic Rhythm Alterations as a Cause for Obesity Cardiomyopathy,"A plethora of putative mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis of obesity cardiomyopathy,
ranging from extra-cardiac (e.g., volume and pressure overload, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and the
neurohumoral environment) to intra-cardiac (e.g., ion homeostasis, signaling, and metabolism) perturbations.
With respect to this application, prior studies have suggested that `metabolic inflexibility' (i.e., inability to
appropriately alter metabolism in response to physiologic stimuli or pathologic stress) plays a pivotal
role in obesity cardiomyopathy development, by precipitating energetic insufficiency, detrimental
metabolite accumulation, impaired signaling, and adverse remodeling. Previous studies from our group
revealed that the normal myocardium exhibits profound metabolic flexibility over the course of the day,
observed at the levels of fatty acid, glucose, and protein metabolism. Furthermore, our studies indicate that
these metabolic oscillations are orchestrated primarily by an intrinsic mechanism within cardiomyocytes, known
as the circadian clock. Contrary to the current dogma, we observe robust day-night differences in cardiac
metabolism during obesity (i.e., preserved metabolic flexibility), which appear to contribute towards obesity-
induced cardiac steatosis, adverse remodeling, and contractile dysfunction. These observations underscore
the importance of identifying mechanistic links between the cardiomyocyte circadian clock and cardiac
metabolism; unbiased transcriptomic and bioinformatics approaches suggest that E4BP4 (a clock-controlled
transcription factor) is a likely candidate. Consistent with E4BP4 regulating cardiac metabolism, our
unpublished preliminary data reveal that cardiomyocyte-specific E4BP4 knockout mouse hearts exhibit
augmented fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, E4BP4 can be pharmacologically repressed, through use of REV-
ERBÎ±/Î² agonists. Collectively, these observations have led to the overarching hypothesis that temporal
governance of cardiac metabolism during obesity plays a causal role in adverse remodeling of the
myocardium, and that repressing clock-controlled E4BP4 attenuates obesity cardiomyopathy
development. In order to test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1. Define fully
24-hr metabolic rhythms in the heart during obesity. Specific Aim 2. Establish E4BP4 as a mechanistic link
between the cardiomyocyte circadian clock and temporal partitioning of cardiac metabolism. Specific Aim 3.
Investigate whether genetic and/or pharmacologic repression of E4BP4 attenuates the pathogenesis of obesity
cardiomyopathy. Successful completion of the proposed studies will challenge current dogmas that
metabolic flexibility and circadian rhythms are invariably beneficial, but instead can contribute towards
the etiology of obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, these studies will likely highlight
E4BP4 as a salutary target for reducing the risk of heart failure in the setting of obesity.","Recent studies from our group have revealed that circadian clock-mediated oscillations in myocardial glucose,
fatty acid, and protein metabolism are essential for maintenance of normal cardiac function. Here, we will test
the hypothesis that alteration of daily metabolic oscillations in the heart contributes to the pathogenesis of heart
dysfunction during obesity. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to new fundamental
insights regarding the causal role of circadian perturbations in the etiology obesity cardiomyopathy, and will
highlight targeting of circadian clock function as a salutary approach for reducing the risk of heart failure.",2019,463033,316106,146927,Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,AL,BIRMINGHAM,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,352940001,Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Obesity,Martin E Young
