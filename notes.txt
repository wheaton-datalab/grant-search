to do:

ordered:

export to csv, maybe onto screen as well
get succinct search terms
get important output in csv
switch to web server, off my own computer

Here are a few ideas you might want to pursue next:

1. Display Results on Your Webpage
Instead of just logging console.log("Grants found:", results), update your main.js to render the list into the DOM.

2. Validation & UX Improvements
Require at least one keyword or agency

Add loading spinners or disable the submit button while waiting for a response

3. Export to CSV
You already discussed OpenCSV. You could add a backend endpoint like /downloadCsv and let users download results.

4. Search History
Store previous searches and allow users to repeat them.

5. Deploy It
Once it works locally, consider deploying to a free service like:

Frontend: GitHub Pages, Netlify

Backend: Render, Railway, or a Spring Boot JAR on your own server



floating:

hook up another API

grab description, go through opp number to access

crawl wheaton webpage (crawling engine, takes the webpage extension dr. li will write)

AI to get the percentage chance someone could get an opportunity (gates foundation .csv)
